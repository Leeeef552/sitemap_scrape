But other regulators typically follow the FAA's lead. Airlines apply their own rules for extended operations and could take time to actually begin flying those routes.\n\n\"Airline approval is a completely different process and it can vary airline by airline,\" said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter.\n\nUnited called the approval \"a positive development\" but said there is no immediate effect on its routes.\n\nThe FAA said its decision reflects the 787's \"reliability history\" and Boeing's \"effectiveness at addressing relevant issues during 250,000 hours of service\" for each of the plane's two-engine types.\n\nLast week, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) urged further testing for the 787 to ensure that the large lithium-ion batteries the plane uses are safe from overheating and fire.\n\nThe NTSB recommendations came even before it had finished investigating what caused a battery to burn on a Japan Airlines 787 in January 2013. Another battery overheated on an All Nippon Airways (ANA) plane later the same month, prompting regulators to ground the global fleet until April that year.\n\nBoeing redesigned the battery and charger and designed a steel box to contain fires and vent hot gasses outside the plane.\n\nThe NTSB said tests originally devised to ensure that the batteries were safe were insufficient, since they did not produce the conditions that occurred in the actual battery incidents. It also said outside experts should be consulting in designing tests.\n\nThe board's recommendations \"are logical because we don't know yet what were the root cause or causes,\" said Hans Weber, a former FAA adviser and president of TECOP International, an aerospace consulting firm based in San Diego, California.\n\nThe FAA approval nevertheless moves airlines an important step closer to tapping the full potential of the Dreamliner, which burns 15 per cent less fuel than the Boeing 767.\n\nThe approval was of little concern to investors, one Wall Street analyst said. Boeing's stock was up 0.4 per cent at US$134.70.\n\nBut the approval appeared to come sooner than expected and its timing was seen by some as a sign of continuing tension between the two agencies, one charged with investigating accidents and the other with ensuring safety.\n\n\"It certainly does seem like there's some conflict between the NTSB and the FAA,\" said an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Firms should thus take into account their business performance, prospects and sustainability before offering built-in wage increases.\n\n\"(But) employers who do well should further reward employees with variable wage components where appropriate, in line with the firm's performance and workers' contributions,\" said the NWC.\n\nIt repeated its call for real wage hikes to stay in line with productivity growth over the long run, so that the increases are sustainable and do not blunt competitiveness.\n\nStephen Lee, the president of the Singapore National Employers Federation, noted that real- wage increases in the last three years have been higher than productivity growth in the last three years, though the reverse was true before that.\n\nThe SNEF, endorsing the NWC guidelines, added that along with other labour-cost increases, the real unit labour cost of the economy rose by 2.8 per cent a year in the last three years.\n\nThe employers' group thus cautioned against \"unsustainable wage increases which will erode the competitiveness of businesses and the real-wage increases of workers, as businesses pass on the higher labour cost to consumers\".\n\nIn its statement accepting the NWC guidelines, the government through the Ministry of Manpower stressed the need to improve productivity \"in order for wage growth to be sustainable and not erode Singapore's economic competitiveness\".\n\nThe NWC, addressing also industries which outsource a big chunk of their operations and hire many low-wage workers, urged these businesses \"to make a special effort\" to build NWC wage recommendations into their contracts for outsourced services.\n\n\"Buyers of outsourced services should also factor the annual wage adjustments for the worker into their contracts, or allow the contract values to be adjusted accordingly,\" it said.\n\nThe NWC also suggested that the Progressive Wage Model, which sets out a career ladder with pay standards for low-wage workers, need not be confined to the cleaning, security and landscaping industries, where low-wage workers are concentrated.\n\nIt proposed that tripartite committees be set up in other sectors as well to develop and implement the Progressive Wage Model, so firms there can raise the skill levels of their workers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The profit attributable to equity-holders - compared with a net loss of $7.4 million a year earlier - came on the back of a 46 per cent rise in Q4 revenue to $26.5 million.\n\nThe year-ago Q4 loss stemmed from a write-off following an arbitration in a unit, which resulted in other operating expenses of $8.5 million. For Q4 FY2014, other operating expenses were $1.6 million.\n\nEarnings per share were 0.83 cent, against a net loss of 2.95 cents a year earlier. Chasen is an investment holding company with subsidiaries in specialist relocation solutions, technical and engineering services, and third-party logistics.\n\nThe revenue surge came from the relocation business segment, which contributed $10.7 million as compared to $3.2 million a year ago. This was due to the continuation of several relocation projects that had commenced earlier in the year in Singapore, China, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nRevenue from the technical and engineering business segment fell from $9.7 million to $9.1 million.\n\nFor FY2014, net profit attributable to equity-holders was $2.5 million, against FY2013's $5.4 million net loss. Revenue grew 28 per cent to $101.5 million. Chasen expects the relocation business segment to continue to contribute significantly this financial year.\n\nIts shares closed trading yesterday at 16.1 cents, up 0.2 cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Everything is done by a small group of people,\" says owner Manisha Gattani.\n\nThe 44-year-old mother of two started making her own embroidered textile accessories 10 years ago as a hobby. But as it grew into a passion, Ms Gattani started giving away the cushion covers, throws and napkins she made to friends and fellow expats she met in Singapore. She set up stalls at local bazaars and flea markets to gain more exposure until finally, she decided that it was time to open her own store.\n\n\"I'm getting old and it started to get harder to pack all my products and lug it to a bazaar. I also wanted to reach a larger audience,\" says Ms Gattani.\n\nAfter about five years of planning and searching for a location, Linen & More finally opened on May 21. Since then, Ms Gattani says that business has been encouraging. The most popular item, Melange blue assorted cushions and runners, from $35 to $79, sold out within a few days of being put on display.\n\n\"We try to cater to everyone by having a wide variety. There are the more elaborate linens and then the minimalist designs,\" she says. For mothers with children who may worry about chocolate stains and dirty feet on cushions, Linen & More has got them covered. It carries a small range of pillow-covers made out of durable and washable fabric.\n\nSince its official opening, Linen & More has had five main collections - Neon Arches, Monogram, Moghul Poppies, Paisley and Melange; the colours of which are inspired by the season.\n\n\"Every four months, the collection changes to match the season. Now we have a lot of bright reds and blues because it's summer. When winter rolls round we'll carry a lot more greys,\" Ms Gattani shares.\n\nThe majority of the designs for these collections come from Ms Gattani herself and ex-university schoolmates who now own a homeware company in India. The bulk of the products sold at the store are also manufactured by the same company.\n\n\"We get inspiration from many places; from the style pages of newspapers, cultural books and things we see when we travel,\" she explains. \"Now with things like whatsapp it's incredibly easy to communicate. I just snap a picture of a fabric or motif and send it over to my friends in India.\"\n\nBy Chew Hui-Yan\n\nPeace of Chic\n\n12 Lim Tua Tow Road\n\nHours: Open daily from 1pm to 8pm\n\nwww.peaceofchic.com\n\nTHE first thing you notice about furniture store Peace of Chic is that there is no theme or concept. The shop holds everything from a chair with a spoof print of the iconic Louis Vuitton pattern to doors from an old mansion in Vietnam close to 100 years old.\n\n\"It's an eclectic mix of bits and pieces from my collection,\" says owner Sean Lee. \"Each piece is unique and has its own story.\"\n\nMr Lee says he was first introduced to the world of furniture collecting through his job.\n\n\"Working as a visual merchandiser was what first got me interested in design. After that, I began working with event organisers, sourcing for furniture for themed events and along the way, I started picking up pieces for myself that caught my eye,\" he says.\n\nMr Lee did this for about 20 years, slowly building up his private collection and storing them in a warehouse.\n\nHowever, earlier this year, he came face to face with a serious dilemma. \"The warehouse became too full. And I still travel to bring in pieces for events and myself. As tough as it was to let some of these things go, by opening Peace of Chic I can keep bringing in new items,\" he says.\n\nAt present, the store holds only 30 per cent of Mr Lee's entire collection, including some pieces that he designed himself. This includes The Camo Range ($550-$1,400) - a camouflage-themed set of chairs and lamp shades - which was a collaboration with designers from Wing Tai, and another called The Guerilla Series which he co-designed.\n\nOther unique pieces include a 1920s Art Decor black wooden chair costing $3,000 from Vietnam, which Mr Lee remembers as a major challenge to acquire.\n\n\"I was really determined to get this piece because for a chair that was designed in the 1920s, it was way ahead of its time, especially in terms of shape,\" he reveals, \"I had to pay quite a sum to convince the man to sell it to me.\"\n\nAlthough Peace of Chic has only been opened for about a month, Mr Lee has already begun expanding and diversifying his business with the hopes of generating some buzz about the neighbourhood located just off Boundary Road.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he opened a cafe two units away from Peace of Chic called The Sunday Market. Designed by Mr Lee and his partner Alice Lee, the tables, chairs and cutlery are all available for purchase. The cafe is also outfitted with some pieces from Mr Lee's collection.\n\n\"I think that this neighbourhood has so much potential. There are a lot of quirky stores opening around here and hopefully soon it'll be a real hip place to be!\" says Mr Lee.\n\nBy Chew Hui-Yan\n\nhychew@sph.com.sg\n\nlife.style.galleria\n\n71 Ubi Road 1, Oxley Bizhub, #08-45 Tel 6702 6160\n\nHours: Weekdays, 9.30am to 6.30pm\n\nMOST homeware stores feature shelves of products, but not life.style.galleria, which makes customers wonder if they stepped into a showflat by accident.\n\nThe two-week old gallery space was started by Stanley Tham and Kusnin Tan, founders of KNQ Associates, an interior design firm. \"We want to show clients how they can do up a space, so we styled it to resemble a one-bedroom apartment,\" says Mr Tham.\n\nIn the process, should a potential client like the furniture or home accessories on display, the two founders can direct them to the respective supplier. Think of it as a homeware store but with a twist.\n\nMr Tham explains: \"We work with respectable lifestyle brands to collaborate via product placements in the mock-up of a home setting to allow consumers to have a better idea of how all these interior products work together.\" He cites the examples from the choice of the audio-visual system, the art hanging on the walls, the room scent, down to the bedding. \"We hope people see it as a showroom to envisage their ideal lifestyle, more than a showcase of a typical interior design in a conventional showroom.\"\n\nCurrently, the gallery works with Bedding Affairs for bedding, Xessex for imported wallcoverings, and OM for its furniture, such as the living and dining room sets. \"New furniture pieces will be on display every three months, so the gallery will always have a fresh look,\" says Mr Tham.\n\nArt-wise, the gallery also has works from Bali-based Indonesian artist Hanh, which are available for sale.\n\nA selection of smaller home accessories that are part of the founders' personal collection are also on display. \"Some of the items were bought a long time ago, but we had no space to display them,\" says Mr Tham. \"We know the suppliers, so should anyone want to buy pieces for themselves, we can help customers with that.\"\n\nAs for the one-off pieces, Mr Tham quips: \"We are also open to the idea of selling our collections on display but 'at the right price'.\"\n\nBy Tay Suan Chiang\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nMondays Off\n\n76 Haji Lane\n\nEmail:\n\nask@mondays-off.com\n\n.\n\nHours: Tues - Sun, 12pm to 8pm\n\nFOR Mondays Off owner, Leyna Poh, her store is like a second home, and she wants her customers to feel the same way too.\n\n\"I wanted a simple, minimalist and stress-free approach,\" explains the 26-year-old who holds a Diploma of Design Communications from the Grenadi School of Design in Melbourne. She had previously worked for a home interior magazine and soon realised the potential of using her skills as a graphic designer to be an interior stylist.\n\nShe opened homeware store Mondays Off in February, after being intrigued with the thought of sprucing up homes with her signature Scandinavian-inspired homeware, and the idea of creating a \"lifestyle\" in personal spaces. A person's decor choices usually reveal their personality, style and opinions, she says. As for her, \"I've always liked Scandinavian and Japanese designs,\" says Ms Poh, explaining that they inspire her style and the minimalist theme she carefully cultivates.\n\nMs Poh sources her products from all over the world and on the Internet. \"Our Zana cushion covers are from South Africa, and we have porcelain jars from the United States.\"\n\nShe also stocks handmade cycling caps and cards from local artists and designers such as Six Rolling Wheels and The Paper Bunny, among others.\n\nMs Poh designs her own items as well; print posters with inspirational quotes from historical luminaries such as Abraham Lincoln. These are printed locally. \"We design and source for products that complement one another, as much as possible,\" she says.\n\nThe store carries items such as cushion covers for $49, posters from $20, and handmade vases to other accessories, from $28. \"I look for creative quirkiness in the products I source,\" she says, \"items that allow people to express their distinct personality and style.\"\n\nMs Poh says the deciding factors of whether or not to bring in a product is not only aesthetic, but practical. Her clients are an eclectic mix, including tourists and locals who do their shopping along the \"very indie\" Haji Lane.\n\nIt hasn't been easy to get to this point, as Ms Poh says she started designing decorative print posters and selling them online, all the while grappling with her full-time job in graphic design. In the end, she took the plunge, quitting her job to work on her store full-time.\n\nThe experience has been challenging, but priceless, she adds. \"Business has been steadily growing, and it's encouraging to see shoppers come in and picking up stuff that I've chosen.\"\n\nBy Georgine Verano\n\ngverano@sph.com.sg\n\nModern Eclectic\n\n120 Lower Delta Road,\n\n#01-14 Cendex Centre\n\nTel 6273 2204\n\nHours: Monday to Saturday, 10am to 6pm\n\nMODERN Eclectic's owner Jane Warner, 42, is on a mission: to bring unique homeware products from around the world to Singapore.\n\n\"I felt that there wasn't the same diversity of homeware products available here as there was in the UK,\" she says. \"I wanted to offer high quality products from diverse sources, each with a unique or interesting story to them.\"\n\nShe believes that it is important for people to create environments that are unique to them, and reflect their interests and personality as opposed to sticking to a theme. \"It is very much about combining objects and styles and throwing out design rules,\" she says. Modern Eclectic combines minimalism with Ms Warner's love of unique vintage items.\n\nMs Warner, who is from the UK, has a background in art, floral design and more recently interior design, and is currently enrolled with the KLC School of Design in London. As a former freelance floral designer, Ms Warner has worked for many private clients and large-scale events such as the European Golf Open.\n\nShe had been in the process of starting a homeware and floral store in the UK, prior to setting up shop in Singapore. That was four years ago, when her husband was posted to Singapore, and she followed suit.\n\nBut it was only last December that she started Modern Eclectic, as it took time to source for the furniture and build the business. She travels widely, and is constantly looking for new products and inspiration on her trips. \"I visit local stores, trade fairs and markets wherever I go,\" says Ms Warner.\n\nProducts include hand-blown glass vases from Poland, bedlinens from Egypt, lamps, pillows and throws from Argentina, Paris and Scotland. She also scours interior magazines and the Internet for ideas and pieces. \"What makes a piece unique is always its story - how and why it was designed,\" she says.\n\nShe cites the example of beautifully embroidered linens from Egypt-based Malaika Linens, which promote quality products with social responsibility by teaching local women embroidery skills to help them improve their economic standing.\n\nDespite having only been open for around five months, Ms Warner says that business has been good, and the response has been positive. \"We have a very diverse range of customers including many local interior designers.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSofitel So Singapore\n\n35 Robinson Road\n\nwww.sofitel.com\n\nA NIGHT at the Sofitel So Singapore is like a night in Paris - but without the Eiffel Tower or the 14-hour flight.\n\nIn the hands of designer Isabelle Miaja, the hotel - which opens today - is an elegant mix of Parisian chic and Singaporean style, with touches of old and new. It also exemplifies the Sofitel So's DNA - boutique hotels characterised by the contemporary design of famous architects, with additional touches by celebrities from the world of fashion, design and art. The Singapore property is the third addition to Sofitel So's stable, which has outposts in Mauritius and Bangkok.\n\nFrench national Ms Miaja - who is the founder of the Singapore-based MIAJA Design Group - has left her design stamp on nearly all areas of the hotel, from the lobby to its restaurant, Xperience and naturally in the 134 rooms. \"There are lots of details in the design, so that guests never tire of the look,\" she says, and where possible, she throws in \"elements of surprise\".\n\nThe rooms are divided into six categories and designed to resemble Parisian apartments, but with local accents. For example the bespoke coffee tables in the rooms come with a map of Singapore printed on them, and the image is reflected on the ceiling.\n\nEach inviting Sofitel MyBed features a headboard with a contemporary interpretation of Singapore's national flower, the orchid.\n\nIn addition, bespoke light boxes, set above each bed, feature images of palatial glass domes inspired by the traditional architecture of Europe and modern buildings in Singapore. \"When you open your eyes in the morning, the dome is the first thing you see, and it gives you a little connection with the outside,\" says Ms Miaja.\n\nThe art pieces in the hotel also reflect this mix of French and Singaporean cultures. A painting of Napoleon takes on a cheeky stance with the late French leader declaring that all roads lead not to Paris but to Singapore. The higher category rooms come with bath tubs that resemble beds, and \"his\" and \"hers\" amenity kits.\n\nThe rooms are divided between two buildings - a conservation 87-year-old building, and a new extension. Working on the heritage building was a challenge for Ms Miaja. Structural walls and existing pillars had to be kept, so \"the sizes of the rooms were always changing, and there is no standard one-size room,\" she says. Keen-eyed guests will notice the extensive use of the hexagon throughout the hotel, from the motif on the lobby floor to the mirrored art installations in the lobby and on the lift landings. Due to its shape, France is often referred to in French as l'Hexagone, or The Hexagon. \"Again, it is to show the French side of the hotel,\" says Ms Miaja.\n\nIn keeping with the brand's DNA, Sofitel So Singapore worked with fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld on the hotel emblem. Taking inspiration from Singapore's history as the Lion City, The Kaiser designed a lion emblem. The Lion's Seal, can be found on a range of products in the hotel, such as the bathrobes, key cards and even on some of the room doors.\n\nGeneral manager, Tony Chisholm, says the hotel will appeal to guests who are \"looking for a difference, and who want to be engaged.\"\n\nTo celebrate its opening, Sofitel So Singapore is offering a staycation from $599++ for two persons, inclusive of a champagne brunch on Saturday, and a morning-after all-day breakfast on Sunday with two glasses of champagne\n\nRelax in an oasis of foliage and light\n\nHoliday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay\n\n2 Magazine Road\n\nwww.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/singapore/sincq/hoteldetail\n\nSTEPPING into this newly opened 442-room hotel is like entering a green oasis, a welcome respite from the suffocating humidity and heat that can overcome both tourist and seasoned local alike.\n\nNatural light pours in from the partially glassed ceiling above the loft-like lobby, but it still feels cool. Lush greenery flourishes just outside the hotel, while bubbling water fountains in both the public walkways and the lobby blur the lines between outdoors and indoors.\n\nIntimate courtyard spaces sprawling with greenery not only soften the look of the building but also bring light deep into the hotel's internal spaces, opening it up for maximum ventilation. Hotel guests are invariably drawn to these spaces which offer reprieve as well as a glimpse of the outdoors.\n\nIn an unusual move, the corridors leading to the rooms and even the hotel gym are naturally ventilated, cutting down on the need for air-conditioning. Guests will also notice that the floor-to-ceiling glass windows are set at a slight angle, but for a reason. The hotel's key architect, Gabriel Chen, a director at RSP Architects Planners & Engineers, explains that each window pane tilts and inclines at an angle to keep the room away from direct sun exposure. The result - rooms that are naturally bright, but yet are still shaded.\n\nOutside, the combined geometries of the tilt and incline of the angled windows project a diamond-like facade design, making it the hotel's distinctive feature. These features, together with other energy-efficient designs of the air-conditioning, water, lighting and heat recovery systems provide a potential energy savings of about 30 per cent annually, and potable water savings the equivalent of five Olympic-sized swimming pools each year. No wonder, then, that the hotel was awarded the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Platinum award in 2013.\n\nMichael Blanding, InterContinental Hotels Groups' (IHG) director of corporate responsibility for Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Greater China, says that managing the environmental impact of the hotels without compromising the guest experience is important for the company. IHG owns the Holiday Inn Express brand.\n\nIn 2009, IHG launched IHG Green Engage, an online system that tracks the use of energy, carbon, water and the management of waste in all its hotels worldwide along with the associated costs. \"We've seen lots of benefits to date. For example, in the last year, we achieved a 2.4 per cent reduction in carbon per occupied room globally,\" says Mr Blanding.\n\nThe hotel group has now set itself a five-year target to further reduce the carbon footprint and water use per occupied room. \"The group is also continually seeking ways in which to influence the design, construction and operations of our hotels to minimise all areas of environmental impact.\"\n\nRoom rates are now going at a special rate from $180++ per night.\n\nRooms with a view - on the walls\n\nHotel Clover The Arts\n\n58 South Bridge Road\n\nwww.hotelcloverthearts.com\n\nBOOKING a hotel room is usually a no-brainer - pick from single or double and if you're lucky, your choice of view.\n\nNot at Hotel Clover The Arts. If you're the indecisive sort, good luck, because you don't just pick your room type but the style of room - all 44 of them, that is.\n\nThe hotel, which opened last month, prides itself on having individually themed rooms, so no two look alike. \"As an advocate of the arts, we wanted to create a platform to showcase local art,\" says the hotel's CEO, Teo Kok Hwee. \"Singapore's art scene, although flourishing, is still relatively young and conservative. Many artists, especially those who are amateur, will find it difficult to find an outlet for their works. We wanted the hotel to be a blank canvas for these talented artists to express themselves, and for guests to enjoy art right here in the hotel. At the same time, we hope to raise awareness for creative talents and different art forms in the local community.\"\n\nIn place of conventional paintings or sculptures, murals appear on nearly all the walls in the hotel. Even the back facade comes adorned with a jungle theme, complete with a five-storey waterfall and butterflies flitting around it.\n\nThe art is the work of well-known graffiti artist, Azlan Ramlan, better known by his nickname, Ceno2. The graffiti artist also left his mark in the lobby and along the corridors, as well as in some rooms. One of which is a breathtaking mural of Mount Fuji, set amid a clear blue sky, crystal clear waters and cherry blossoms. The hotel also held a competition for students from art and design schools, \"some of whom have really great flair but who often do not have as many opportunities and platforms to show their work,\" says Mr Teo.\n\nThe winning mural was created by three students from Raffles Design Institute, featuring a vintage travel journal encapsulating several attractions in Singapore, including Marina Bay Sands and Universal Studios. To get the words on the mural the right thickness, the students even used eyeliner to enhance their work.\n\nThe hotel also roped in members of the Life Arts Society, a non-profit organisation aiming to create greater awareness in local art, to create some of the murals.\n\nSome of the other rooms feature scenes of Singapore, as well as nature and wildlife on the walls. Murals are done in different styles, from retro kitsch, urban street art, Pop Art vibrancy and line art minimalism. Guests staying in any room will receive a postcard with the corresponding artwork which they can take home. The artists were given an open brief to create their murals, except for one condition - nothing gothic or scary.\n\n\"Themed hotels add dimension to the overall hotel experience with a different perspective and also to provide an alternative option when it comes to hotel choices,\" says Mr Teo..\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\n@TaySuanChiangBT\n\nRoom rates at Hotel Clover The Arts start from $235++.

Local Chinese-speaking communities can already use existing websites, and the group wants to create local Taobao marketplaces in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe latter has a young population, two-thirds of which already has broadband access according to the National IT Council.\n\nJust 2 per cent of Alibaba's consumer retail revenue in the nine months ending December last year came from outside China.\n\nOne question is why Alibaba needs to spend US$249 million to cement the relationship.\n\nA recent deal with Australia Post didn't include any mention of an equity purchase.\n\nAs a national operator, SingPost cannot offer Alibaba preferential prices, and there's also nothing to stop rivals such as eBay, or even Chinese rival JD.com, from forging similar partnerships.\n\nThe answer may be that the deal has symbolism ahead of Alibaba's stock market debut. Would-be investors are poring over its massive Taobao and Tmall sites, but might not be so focused on the option value from rolling out Alibaba's network of buyers and sellers overseas.\n\nTying up with SingPost might have an expansionary effect not just on the company's network, but on its potential IPO valuation. - Reuters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The top 10 smallest companies reported a 6.4 per cent rise in value while the top 10 biggest firms saw a 1.9 per cent increase.\n\nNearly all industries - with the exception of electricity/gas/wa-ter, manufacturing and agriculture - posted gains in May over the previous month. The transport/storage/comms sector was the best performer, rising 6 per cent to $134.3 billion. Meanwhile, the electricity/gas/water and agriculture sectors contracted one per cent and 2.1 per cent to $6.2 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. Manufacturing was down 0.3 per cent to $97 billion.\n\nWhen comparing against May 2013, the mining/quarry sector was the star performer, gaining nearly 255 per cent to $3.5 billion.\n\nGainers outnumbered losers 338 to 269 in May over April, but the reverse was true when comparing year-on-year, with losers dominating gainers 362 to 292.\n\nGreat Eastern was the biggest gainer in terms of value with $1.32 billion in growth month-on-month, while Wilmar was the biggest loser, giving up $1.21 billion.\n\nIn percentage terms, KOP saw the biggest gains at about 735 per cent and Next-Gen Satellite the heaviest drop with 50 per cent.\n\nDuring the month, the billion-dollar club added two more members to total 115.

It is a model that also calls for more judgment and estimates from companies.\n\nThe standard is also notable in that it marks a coming together of the IASB and the FASB on accounting standards. IFRS 15 is a joint project between the two bodies that has been 12 years in the making.\n\nNigel Sleigh-Johnson, head of The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales' (ICAEW) Financial Reporting Faculty, said: \"Until now, there have been significant differences in how and when revenue has been recognised and reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (US GAAP), which has made it difficult to compare reported revenues across companies, industries and capital markets.\n\n\"This new 'flagship' convergence standard will improve comparability and the quality of information available.\"\n\nMichael Lim, chairman of Singapore's Accounting Standards Council (ASC), which prescribes accounting standards here, said: \"This new IFRS on revenue recognition took a fairly long time to finalise, but it marks a commendable stride by the IASB towards improved financial reporting. It represents a timely overhaul of the existing requirements in IFRIC 15 (on the recognition of revenue by real estate developers for sales of units) that were seen as rigid by business communities.\"\n\nIt's been a big step for the standard setters, but arguably bigger steps will be required of companies.\n\nGerald Low, audit partner at KPMG in Singapore, said: \"Many companies typically prepare five-year budgets and these budgets may have to be re-visited to take into account the proposed changes of the new standard. Additionally, revisions may have to be made to executive compensation packages linked to revenue numbers. IT systems may also have to be reconfigured to reflect the changes to the timing of revenue recognition.\"\n\nMak Keat Meng, head of Assurance at EY in Singapore, said: \"The new standard also requires companies to publicly disclose much more information on revenue in their financial statements in the hope that investors and other users will benefit from the enhanced information.\"\n\nChen Voon Hoe, Accounting Advisory & Reporting leader at PwC Singapore, said that the new standard will require companies to identify separate performance obligations in a contract, allocate the transaction price to each obligation and only recognise revenue when the obligation is satisfied.\n\nAmong those most affected will be the telcos.\n\nMr Chen said: \"For example, a telecommunication company is required to allocate revenue earned on the customer contract to the respective components - handset and the subscription service based on its relative stand-alone selling prices. Currently, most telcos recognise the revenue on the handset based on the promotional sales price rather than the full selling price.\n\n\"Under the new standard, the telco may recognise higher revenue allocated to the handset based on its relative selling price at the point of sale. The impact may be significant as most handsets sold today are smart phones which have a higher selling price.\"\n\nIn addition, Mr Chen said \"software companies, media and music companies that license intellectual property will need to determine if they are providing the right to use or access intellectual property\".\n\nSpecialists say that real estate and construction companies will also be impacted greatly - and will likely be among the earliest adopters of the new standard.\n\nMr Low said: \"Revenue and profits are currently recognised only upon completion of their developments overseas. This causes significant earnings volatility. Applying the new standard is expected to allow revenue and profits for some overseas building projects with non-refundable progress payments to be recognised progressively. Many developers in Singapore are already eagerly waiting for the ASC to issue the new standard here.\"\n\nHe pointed out that, in terms of other companies, ship and oil rig builders are likely to experience significant earnings volatility from adopting the new standard. \"For affected companies, the new standard may change their earnings pattern by deferring revenue until delivery of the vessels in some cases.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With this mobile wallet, DBS customers can keep funds of up to $999 in the mobile application, and use that pool of money - drawn from a designated DBS savings or current account - as a source of funds to send money to other DBS customers. The daily transfer limit is also set at $999.\n\nDBS expects this form of fund transfer to be more convenient than typical Internet banking transactions, since only the mobile phone numbers of payers and recipients are needed. Recipients are alerted by SMS, or an app notification.\n\nVariants of mobile wallets in the market - such as the one hosted by PayPal - must still be funded by money held in bank accounts, said Louis Foo, head of the consumer banking group's eBusiness division at DBS, at a briefing yesterday.\n\n\"We built that wallet ourselves, so that the whole experience is seamless.\"\n\nMr Foo sees a critical mass in mobile banking usage. DBS has about two million Internet banking customers, and some 800,000 are mobile banking users.\n\nUsers can customise the settings such that all money sent via this app is not kept in the wallet, but is deposited straight into the recipient's designated savings or current account.\n\nIf a DBS customer receives money that exceeds the wallet's transfer limit - whether at the maximum of $999, or at a customised level - the excess amount is immediately transferred into his assigned account.\n\nDBS had earlier launched Singapore's first virtual credit card on a mobile phone. The three telcos - M1, SingTel and StarHub - have also created mobile wallets linked to DBS's service, known as DBS One.Tap. The telcos and the bank planned to charge for the service eventually, having waived certain fees for a stipulated period.\n\nBut the usage has not been \"as well as anticipated\", said Mr Foo. He noted that the technology backing this service - known as near field communication - is not supported on the ubiquitous iPhones.\n\nFor comparison, the fund transfer service launched by OCBC earlier this month requires the recipient to input a passcode shared by the sender, and his account number. Besides the option of SMS, recipients can receive notifications via Facebook.\n\nUOB's existing service, known as Mobile Cash, has allowed its customers to transfer up to $500 using mobile phone numbers since 2011, though it requires recipients to be pre-registered. The bank will be enhancing this service to make cash transfers more convenient, said Gilbert Chuah, UOB's group head of Internet channels.\n\nThe mobile wallet - which is free for download - excludes fund transfers from credit cards now, but DBS is open to providing that service. Mobile wallet providers in the US already have this service, but it comes with a fee charge.\n\nDBS expects the service to be safe because it is limited to its customers, said Mr Foo.\n\nIf a thief successfully hacks into a person's phone and gains access to the mobile wallet, he can only go so far as to move all existing funds into his wallet, which can be tracked down by DBS. The initial setup and subsequent setting changes also need the use of the security token.\n\nDBS is also conducting a pilot study for a mobile payment terminal for on-the-go merchants. The study should be done by the second half of the year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Work life has also changed - leaner staff, more responsibilities, more travel, tighter work schedules and deadlines were all feedback that we listened to carefully.\"\n\nThe final list of 30 recommendations was submitted to the government last week after nearly a year of public consultation involving over 40,000 people.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net asset value stood at $1.05 as at end-March, down from $1.08 the previous year.\n\nA final dividend of one cent per share was proposed, down from 2.5 cents previously.\n\nThis brings dividend for the full year to two cents per share, down from four cents a year ago.\n\nTat Hong shares closed 1.5 cents lower at 85.5 cents yesterday, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

BT Weekend looks at players trying to change mindsets to elevate vegetarian cuisine to gastronomic levels\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE demand for healthier eating and greener food has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few years, with more requests for it by the day, say restaurateurs who are proponents of the trend. \"It's been a sea change since I started with the idea of 'conscious dining' six years ago. Today I'm constantly getting requests from people who want to open restaurants selling vegetarian fare or healthier food,\" says Rosalind Lim, owner of Onaka at Rochester Park and Alexandra Retail Centre.\n\nLast year, when high-end dining restaurant Saint Pierre held two special 25-course vegetarian degustation dinners, they were quickly sold out, and the restaurant could have easily sold a few more nights of the same, declares Edina Hong, who manages the corporate business of the Emmanuel Stroobant group of restaurants. \"We used to get a few requests for vegetarian dishes at the restaurant, but these days, it's easily 50 covers a month,\" she adds.\n\nIt's definitely a viable business option, notes Lee Han Yong of Secret Recipe. The Malaysian chain restaurant launched its chain of meatless restaurants, Beyond Veggie, a year and a half ago, and is seeing a high acceptance rate for it.\n\nFong Chi Chung, president of Putien Holdings isn't a vegetarian himself, but recognised healthy food and lifestyle as a trend going forward. \"Normally, we eat too much meat and seafood in our daily diets, which is a heavy burden on our bodies. I feel it's time for people to realise they can eat healthier to lessen the body's burden,\" he says. Putien just brought in Taiwan company Wowprime's chain of Sufood restaurants to Singapore and sees the potential for eight to 10 outlets in Singapore in the next five years if demand is strong.\n\nChefs fronting the green revolution have had their workload doubled in the last few years. Chef Lim gets constant requests to give lessons and consultations for menus - so she teaches at clients' private homes and also at homes catering specifically to the elderly who are recovering from surgery or illness, or children with special diets. She sees demand from a variety of sectors: from other restaurateurs who want to offer vegetarian and vegan food; from a bank which wants to provide healthy food for its staff in its inhouse cafe; to a vending machine company which is keen to develop healthier vending machine food.\n\n\"It's changed so much over the last six years, it's quite amazing. While I see the trend of people eating healthier, I also see the trend of growing food intolerance,\" she notes. Onaka opened a second centre at Alexandra Retail Centre in December 2012, and where she used to see an 80 per cent expatriate and 80 per cent female crowd, she now caters to a good mix of local diners and sometimes, she's seen all-male diners at her outlet. On the personal side, she's writing a cookbook and taking dietitian classes in Traditional Chinese Medicine to see how she can modernise cooking with herbs.\n\nThe growing acceptance also means that chefs can now be more experimental and adventurous with the ingredients. At Onaka, a top-seller is their watermelon sashimi, which features tuna-looking slices of compressed watermelon topped with agar-agar pearls flavoured with wasabi. And quinoa is everywhere. \"Even normal salad places offer you quinoa these days. Five years ago, it would never have happened. People now are definitely more clued in to healthier eating,\" says Bjorn Shen, chef-owner of Artichoke.\n\nChef Shen had even toyed with the idea of turning Artichoke fully vegetarian years ago. \"Just because we were having so much fun with the vegetables, and it's a much more direct farm-to-table concept than meats which have to go through several processes before they are served at the table,\" he says. Artichoke has a strong emphasis on its vegetable dishes, and it just takes more \"cognitive ability,\" Shen says, to elevate vegetables and find ways to cook them interestingly, compared to cooking a piece of meat.\n\n\"So we pride ourselves on our vegetable dishes.\" However, he'll point out that while there's a high incidence of diners ordering vegetable dishes at his restaurant, it's largely to do with its shared-platters format.\n\nShen himself goes vegetarian once a week, and after all - his restaurant is opposite Fortune Centre, the vegetarian food centre of Singapore. The good thing is that with the higher demand, the supply has also gotten better, with more importers as well. \"So supply is less of an issue these days,\" say the restaurateurs.\n\nWith the rise of fitness practices such as yoga and pilates, the anti-fast food trend and increasing knowledge of bad food practices especially concerning meats, the green food revolution looks like it will grow from strength to strength.\n\nBy Cheah Ui-Hoon and Rachel Loi\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Abe will also hold a joint summit meeting with Mr Lee tomorrow where the two will issue a joint statement.\n\nThe Singapore meeting comes at a critical time when geopolitical tensions have been rising in North-east Asia between China and Japan as well as between China and some Asean member states, including Vietnam and the Philippines over territorial disputes and maritime confrontations.\n\nWar is \"not impossible\" if escalating regional tensions are not managed responsibly, Mr Lee said last week while delivering the keynote speech at a conference on the future of Asia held in Tokyo by Japan's Nikkei media group.\n\n\"No country wants war, and every country will try to avoid it but that does not make war in Asia impossible,\" he said. \"There will be tensions and frictions,\" he said. \"Incidents can escalate and miscalculations can lead to unintended conflicts.\"\n\nMr Abe is expected to offer reassurances at the Shangri-La Dialogue meeting that a more proactive defence policy on Japan's part will serve to \"enhance deterrence\" against possible confrontations in the region, Japanese officials say.\n\n\"Asean countries which have disputes with China will support (Mr Abe),\" Reuters yesterday reported Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, as saying.\n\nMr Abe is expected to emphasise Japan's view that disputes over territorial claims and other issues must be resolved by adherence to the \"rule of law\".\n\n\"This will be a good opportunity for the prime minister to explain (such issues) in his own words and to create a good environment,\" a Japanese official said.\n\nMr Abe has been projecting a much expanded international diplomatic profile for Japan since his government came to power at the end of 2012.\n\nDuring a visit by the Japanese leader to Nato headquarters recently, the two sides signed an \"individual partnership and cooperation programme\" that will serve as a roadmap for future joint activities, Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said.\n\nAnother item on the agenda during Mr Abe's two-day visit to Singapore will be visits to the integrated resorts at Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore.\n\nJapan's parliament currently has before it legislative proposals to allow similar integrated casino, leisure and shopping resorts in the country.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investors cheered Singapore Post's (SingPost) strategic pact with China's e-commerce giant Alibaba, jolting its shares up by 8.4 per cent or 13 cents to $1.68 - a fresh all-time high since its listing in 2003.\n\nThe counter, which hit a day's high of $1.75, racheted up trading volumes of 67 million shares worth $114.3 million on news that Alibaba will pick up a 10.35 per cent stake in the postal company for $312.5 million. It was the day's most active stock by value and fourth most active by volume. Both firms will also join hands to leverage on each other's strengths - SingPost on Alibaba's hefty business volumes and the online retail giant on SingPost's steady e-commerce logistics network in the region.\n\nThe tone among analysts, who were mostly already bullish on the firm prior to the announcement of the landmark deal on Wednesday, was upbeat.\n\nSome, such as CIMB Research analysts, even served up more spice, conjecturing that Alibaba, en route to an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States, could buy a bigger slice of SingPost by snapping up Singapore Telecommunications' (SingTel) 25 per cent stake in the postal carrier.\n\n\"Compared to the expected US$15 billion-US$20 billion to be raised from the IPO, a US$609 million investment to buy out SingTel's stake in SingPost does not seem like a big feat,\" said CIMB, which has raised its target price for SingPost to $1.86 on the back of the deal's goodness.\n\nBullishly titled Open sesame, CIMB's report lauded Singapore's national postal carrier's steady progress in shaping up into a regional e-commerce logistics player.\n\nThe tie-up, it said, would provide SingPost with \"fuel to expand more aggressively in the region, with stronger earnings growth potential both organically and via mergers and acquisitions\" (M&As).\n\nWith a plumped-up cash position - the deal will raise net proceeds of $308 million - SingPost will be able to not only step up the pace of acquisitions but also boost the size of targeted assets.\n\n\"SingPost's strategic partnership with Alibaba opens doors via access to funds for larger-scale M&As and the opportunity to leverage on Alibaba's customer base to scale up its regional e-commerce logistics operations,\" said CIMB.\n\nSingPost has already staunchly set itself apart from other postal players in Asia by moving big time into e-commerce to tap the potential of the growing Internet economy and offset the sliding traditional mail business.\n\nUnder a rigorous plan and one that also involved gobbling up assets in the region, it has cleverly pieced together a whole spectrum of end-to-end e-commerce logistics solutions with a last-mile delivery network in Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nIt is SingPost's point-to-point logistics in the region, a sweet, burgeoning yet relatively new market for the Chinese e-retailer which online bazaar Taobao is looking to grow internationally, that must have been the lure.\n\nFor SingPost, the deal with the world's largest online and mobile commerce company, it is hoped, will broaden the customer base, crank up volumes and turn in rosier margins from higher utilisation of warehousing, freight forwarding and international mail.\n\nBut first, as pointed out by OCBC Investment Research analyst Low Pei Han, SingPost needs to step up investments to build a full regional e-commerce logistics value chain to better handle Alibaba's volumes.\n\n\"With access to more volumes, SingPost would be able to obtain a scale effect and bring down cost per unit of good handled,\" Ms Low added.\n\nEven from a credit ratings perspective, there was good news, albeit expected given that the deal will top up SingPost's kitty.\n\nStandards & Poor's maintained its A rating with a stable outlook for SingPost on the premise of a strong business profile and modest financial risk.\n\n\"The partnership is consistent with our expectation that SingPost will continue to enhance its market position in logistics and express delivery in Asia-Pacific and conservatively execute its investment activities,\" said the rating agency.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/value-add-main-criterion-admitting-foreign-entrepreneurs", "site_title": "Value-add main criterion for admitting foreign entrepreneurs", "publish_date": null, "content": "Value-add main criterion for admitting foreign entrepreneurs\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nAN \"accident\", is how Casa Italia chief executive Phippo Hardegger describes founding his gelato company in Singapore.\n\nUnable to secure an Australian visa, the Swiss was persuaded by a friend to come here instead. Finding regulations that do not hinder, and a government forthcoming with the information he needed, sealed the decision, he says.\n\n\"Everything is so clearly regulated, people keep to their contracts, and you have pretty much no corruption here,\" he says. \"It's just extremely convenient.\"\n\nPreviously named Gelateria Italia, the firm has opened 15 stores in three years of existence. A lot of attention here is paid to local startups, but foreign entrepreneurs like Mr Hardegger contribute significantly to the vitality of the entrepreneurial scene too.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics tracking the population of foreign entrepreneurs here, a number of them are on the EntrePass scheme, which permits them to start businesses in Singapore.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower, the number of EntrePass holders fell 23.1 per cent, from 1,300 in 2012 to 1,000 last year, but some observers feel it is the quality and not the quantity of these entrepreneurs that matters.\n\n\"The number is not the issue. The issues are the quality of the business, its leadership and its value to Singapore,\" said Victor Mills, acting chief executive of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce. \"Singapore looks for quality, not quantity.\"\n\nMOM revised EntrePass requirements last September to ensure it attracts \"foreign entrepreneurs who can inject innovation and vibrancy into Singapore's business scene\", said an MOM spokesman. Most EntrePass holders operate in commerce or finance and business services. Last year saw 2,000 EntrePass applications and, as has been the case since 2003, half were approved.\n\nThere are other possible reasons for the fall in EntrePass holders. Singapore now competes for foreign entrepreneurs with countries that may be closer to the entrepreneurs' homes, said Singapore Management University associate professor of strategic management Tan Wee Liang.\n\nInsead professor of entrepreneurship Philip Anderson reckons, however, that \"the most logical explanation is simple economics - Singapore is expensive. If the cost of living continues to rise, we will probably see a shift in foreign entrepreneurs\". But he adds that \"on balance (Singapore) is attractive for entrepreneurs who seek to reach a pan-Asia market\".\n\nAs Asia's safest and most attractive living space, Singapore is \"Asia-lite\", and easy for foreigners to fit into, said Mr Mills. Wong Poh Kam, director of the National University of Singapore Entrepreneurship Centre, added that culturally, linguistically and racially diverse Singapore is an \"ideal test-bed\" for those eyeing Asia.\n\nHiroshi Tatara, who founded Japanese food group RE&S here in 1988, also sees Singapore as an ideal \"showcase\" for presenting a business to potential partners. Twelve million tourists a year visiting such a \"small territory\" means good exposure to partners interested in expanding a concept regionally, he said.\n\nOne foreign entrepreneur who started a business here that has since gone regional is Norbreeze Group's Danish chief executive, Anders Peter Juel Sauerberg. Since its 2004 founding, the watch group has come to also carry jewellery and lifestyle products in 50 stores in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.\n\nNorbreeze began by importing \"affordable-luxury\" watches after Mr Sauerberg spotted a mid-range void in market offerings here. It now expects turnover to exceed $70 million this year before growing over 40 per cent in each of the next three to five years.\n\nMr Hardegger is similarly optimistic. \"Our target is to have the first global gelato chain in the world,\" he says. In this, his challenge has been finding people committed to the service industry. \"The people who apply for these jobs are coming out of school ... they're not used to work.\"\n\n\"If something is not 100 per cent according to what they like, they just walk out of your store,\" he said, so front-end staff must make gelato at the factory for a \"feel for what they sell\".\n\nNorbreeze tackles similar challenges with its \"Danish management style, which is the opposite of micromanagement\", says Mr Sauerberg. \"It's empowering people, having a clear vision of what you want to do, (letting) people get on with their jobs.\"\n\nBesides its corporate culture, the \"secret sauce\" in Norbreeze's customer service is its in-house training, he says. Three sales trainers shape each store's training based on monthly evaluations by the company's \"mystery shoppers\".\n\nFinding the right people is also Stone Apple Solutions' biggest challenge, says the IT service provider's chief executive, Madhujeet Chimni. But chief operating officer Bharadwaj Chivukula says staying at technology's forefront helps Stone Apple woo talent.\n\n\"When you're in technology, you want to be working on the latest releases,\" he said. \"You'd rather be with an organisation that is in the limelight ... nobody likes to be idle.\" In this, Singapore has been an ideal host.\n\nMr Chimni and Mr Chivukula, who were already based in Singapore, started the company in 2009 with a third partner. From just its founders - all three of whom are Indian nationals - the company now employs 1,400 staff.\n\nEven as it scaled up for \"critical mass\", Stone Apple has tried to \"stay niche, and at the same time stay relevant to the enterprise community,\" said Mr Chivukula. Its specialities include enterprise resource planning and business intelligence and analytics. Mr Chimni believes Stone Apple's focus is an essential part of the growth story of the company, which generated a turnover of $80 million last year in 12 countries stretching from Australia to the US.\n\nScaling up and reaching global markets is the challenge for Singapore-based businesses, says Prof Wong. In this respect, he believes businesses run by foreign entrepreneurs knowledgeable of their home market may actually have an advantage over companies managed mainly by locals.\n\n\"Because of this, we are now seeing many of our young tech start-ups being founded by a team of entrepreneurs from different parts of the world,\" he said.\n\nHe expects foreign entrepreneurship here to rise. \"Asia is driving global economic growth, so entrepreneurs here are in the right place at the right time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Whether you are just a couple or a big corporate group, Debbie Yong susses out 8 bespoke ways to experience the two Australian megacities\n\nPublished Fri, May 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSydney\n\n1 Explore the Sydney Opera House on a private tour\n\nWHEN performances are not on-going at the opera house, glean interesting trivia behind the four performance spaces - the concert hall, opera theatre, drama theatre and playhouse - and the 10,000 pipes of the largest organ in the world on a private tour of the Unesco World Heritage-listed site. Did you know that the building's ship-inspired design by Danish architect Jorn Utzon was rescued from a pile of discarded early submissions? Or that its concert hall has played host to luminaries such as the Dalai Lama, the late Nelson Mandela and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously made his comeback in a bodybuilding competition held there in 1980? The performance halls and foyers can be cordoned off for corporate events and gala dinners, with professional opera singers rostered in if required. Or, take a cue from Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt and tie the knot under its eaves, with the sunset across the Sydney harbour bridge as a backdrop beyond compare.\n\nPrivate tours in various languages, with additional packages for dinner, zoo visits or sailing trips available through\n\nwww.sydneyoperahouse.com\n\n2 Sail across the Sydney harbour with a professional regatta crew\n\nSNAPPING pictures of the opera house from the harbour bridge or vice versa too pedestrian for you? Dodge the general tourist scrum by setting sail across the harbour for unbeatable views of Sydney's most photographed icons. It's not just a leisurely cruise, mind you. You get to be part of the crew, helm the steering wheel or work on the grinders alongside veteran competitive sailors on your choice of two 75-ft yachts that have competed in prestigious sailing regatta, the America's Cup.\n\nPrivate charters for 30 to 700 guests available through Sailing Sydney,\n\nwww.sailingsydney.net\n\n3 Hog the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a private bridge climb\n\nWHY jostle with the masses who only get in the way of your selfie on the very top, when you can have the bridge all to yourself as the ultimate bragging right? Besides the usual 3.5 hour or 2 hour express climbs for groups of 12 to 14, larger groups can also book the entire bridge for exclusive use at your preferred time, be it at sunrise, sunset or for special occasions such as New Year's Eve or wedding proposals. Capacity is not an issue: in July last year, over 2,100 climbers from Chinese firm Perfect China lodged a record for the largest group booking when they reserved the bridge for four days.\n\nFor private climbs and corporate packages, head to\n\nwww.bridgeclimb.com\n\n4 Spend a day outdoors at outdoor adventure centre, Glenworth Valley\n\nSYDNEY may be synonymous with the glittery big city lifestyle, but there are also activities aplenty in the great outdoors - if one knows where to look. Nearby Glenworth Valley is a popular outdoor adventure centre sequestered away in the hinterlands just 65km north of Sydney, and is an all-in-one stop for nature lovers looking to do some trekking, horse-riding, quad biking or camping under the stars.\n\nThere's a regular schedule of activities that kicks into high gear during the school holiday season, or send loved ones your wishlist for a bespoke itinerary. To truly get away in style, one can also opt to be shuttled between Sydney and the valley via a 20-minute helicopter ride, where you can take in panoramic views of Sydney and its surrounds.\n\nFor more information and schedules, visit\n\nwww.glenworth.com.au\n\nMelbourne\n\n1 Pad through the city on a guided walking tour\n\nTHE gold rush of the late 1800s meant that Melbourne was one of the richest cities in the world, hence elaborate turn-of-the-century architecture can still be spotted around the city today.\n\nOne place to see it all up close is The Block Arcade, a 19th-century shopping arcade dotted with storied boutiques such as Canturi Jewels by leading jewellery designer Stefano Canturi, who famously designed Nicole Kidman's 1,308 diamond-studded necklace in the movie Moulin Rouge! (2001), and the century-old Hopetoun Tea Room, which today pulls in a perpetual queue for its old-world three-tiered tea sets and pastries baked fresh daily.\n\nA tip to skip the queue? The whole place can be booked out for private events and celebrations for a minimum sum. Later, explore the city's renowned laneways, a network of thoroughfares studded with quirky boutiques, with in-the-know locals from Melbourne Private Tours.\n\nThough you're unlikely to lose yourself in the centre of the city, seasoned guides provide a much-needed compass to sniffing out gems, such as the legally permitted street art on Hosier Lane or Italian paper merchant Il Papiro and Clementine's, which specialises in produce sourced from around the Victoria state on Degraves Street.\n\nCustomised routes can be arranged through Melbourne Private Tours at\n\nwww.mpttravelandlifestyle.com.au\n\n2 Brew your own Melbourne-style coffee\n\nMELBOURNE is widely revered as a mecca for coffee - but don't just blithely drink it all in, learn how to brew up some black gold yourself too.\n\nAuthor of Devouring Melbourne Monique Bayer has literally written the book on the origins of coffee in this foodie city, and also conducts food-centric tours around town, with hands-on coffee cupping classes included. If you're particularly good with your hands, you can pair this off with millinery and hatmaking workshops by expert milliner Kim Fletcher to fashion your own fascinator or fedora in time for the Melbourne Cup every November, the city's most glitzy excuse for dolling up.\n\nMonique Bayer can be contacted through\n\nwww.walkmelbourne.com.au\n\nand Kim Fletcher through\n\nwww.kimfletcher.com.au\n\n3 View a musical or the Australian Open from a private suite\n\nALREADY caught the misbehaving tennis star Bernard Tomic stomping the courts at the Australian Open or a motorised King Kong puppet doing likewise in the Regent Theatre? Level up the experience by doing it again - but this time in a private hospitality suite.\n\nModern European pre-theatre dinner menus can be arranged at any of the Marriner Group's five landmark theatres, including the Regent, Princess and Forum theatres, in various plush, gilded rooms that can hold from 20 to 1,800 (the latter in the Regent's grandiose Plaza Ballroom). Because there's nothing like getting to beat the washroom queues and sneaking in a complimentary ice-cream during intermission.\n\nSimilarly, \"superboxes\" at the Rod Laver Arena can hold up to 18 persons and come with full food and wine catering, butlers, designated parking lots - along with a luxuriously air-conditioned bird's eye vantage point views of the tennis action.\n\nBooking details for the Marriner group available at\n\nwww.marrinergroup.com.au\n\n, and for the Rod Laver Arena's Superboxes at\n\nwww.rodlaverarena.com.au/superboxes\n\n4 Explore the Yarra Valley\n\nYOU haven't been to Melbourne if you haven't knocked back a glass in the Yarra Valley, Victoria's oldest wine region dotted with over 100 cool climate wineries.\n\nFor a winery with a difference, pencil in a refuelling stop at Rochford Wines, a 50 hectare property that is really more an entertainment venue comprising a winery, art gallery and restaurant next to 22 hectares of twisting grapevines.\n\nBest known for hosting the A Day on the Green series of summer music concerts, which have seen the likes of Rod Stewart, Lionel Ritchie and Nora Jones performing onsite, the winery also regularly hosts jazz and other live music concerts throughout the year.\n\nBigger groups can opt to traverse its grapevines on Segways. There are also friendly archery, go-karting and wine stomping competitions that can be arranged for groups of up to 260 people.\n\nTeetotallers or those with kids in tow can opt instead for a more contemplative saunter through stone fruit specialists Rayner's Orchard, where Farmer Len Rayner will truck you through his 25 hectare farm with 8,000 trees to sample everything from succulent peaches, persimmons and nectarines to rarely seen specimens such as the minuscule kiwi berries, Chinese quinces, strawberry peaches and pepinos, a succulent South America-originated cross between a melon, cucumber and tomato.\n\nTrivia to impress your friends with: Did you know that the kiwi fruit is actually a Chinese gooseberry? It was named after the national bird of New Zealand in 1959 for being similarly small, brown and furry.\n\nLater, cuddle up close with other Antipodean animals such as koalas and kangaroos at the nearby Healesville Sanctuary, part-educational zoo with plenty of activities for the young ones and part-bushland haven for wild animal rescue and rehabilitation.

If you don't want to, you can stop any time you wish. The fact of the matter is, we are living longer and staying healthier, and many people find working to be part of active ageing.\"\n\nMr Tan also spoke at length on some MPs' worries about whether the current rate of CPF returns was adequate, which he admitted was a \"fair concern\".\n\n\"Some have asked if CPF interest rates should be higher in order to withstand inflation. That's a fair consideration.\n\n\"Others have advocated higher returns, perhaps taking on more risk with CPF monies. But is that something we want to do?\"\n\nHe noted that the existing CPF interest rates today are \"far higher\" than the equivalent rates provided by similar products in the market.\n\nStill, he stressed, the government was studying this aspect in its plans to enhance the CPF Life annuity scheme, under which members receive payouts for the rest of their life.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the House that the government would look into improving the CPF and CPF Life schemes in such a way that the payouts would keep pace with the cost of living.\n\nLower-income groups who may not have very much tucked away in their CPF accounts would be given \"stronger assurance\" in retirement, he said.\n\nMr Lee will announce more details of the enhancements to CPF Life at his annual National Day Rally speech in August.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

CTCA is a non-invasive outpatient procedure where an iodine-based contrast is injected into the arm veins and three-dimensional X-ray images of the heart arteries are taken within seconds. It is increasingly being used as an alternative to conventional coronary angiography (CCA) which involves the insertion of plastic tubes into the heart arteries to obtain images using X-rays. Over the last 10 years, the indications for the use of CTCA for the diagnosis of heart disease as recommended by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have expanded rapidly to cover most areas of heart artery disease.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

This year, the organisers are hoping for even more to enjoy the evening at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\n\nBoth familiar and new faces feature in the cast this time. Singaporean conductor Joshua Tan is back, and so are Singapore-born soprano Cherylene Liew and baritone William Lim.\n\nThis is the fifth Opera in the Park for Liew, who admits she is hooked on it: \"I enjoy singing in such lush surroundings to a very appreciative audience.\"\n\nLiew, who holds a Bachelor of Music (Voice) and Master of Philosophy in Music, will sing the second half of the programme: the Merry Widow segment. She is currently based in Brisbane, but has been commuting as often as she can.\n\nAs per tradition, the show will feature new faces, with three students from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) making their debut. Tenor Jeremy Koh, one of the trio, says: \"It is my first Opera in the Park, but I look forward to singing outdoors for a change. The ambience is different from places like music halls.\"\n\nKoh was recently awarded first prize at the Tan Ngiang Kaw/Tan Ngiang Ann Memorial Vocal Competition this year at NAFA.\n\nIn addition to the orchestra and lead singers, the Singapore Lyric Opera Children's Choir will also be making a guest appearance.\n\n\"I am a strong believer in opera being an accessible art form. Every Opera in the Park concert has been very well attended, so this is a great opportunity for me to help others get a taste of what opera is and could be,\" says Liew.\n\nOpera in the Park' will be held on June 7 at 6pm, at the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\n\nAdmission is free.\n\nFor more information, log on to\n\nwww.singaporeopera.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That explanatory disclosure statement will be used by creditors and shareholders to decide whether to support the exit plan.\n\nUS Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh in Wilmington, Delaware, overruled an objection by a committee representing shareholders who wanted an extra five days to find a buyer for their stock. Under the plan, they have from now until June 3.\n\nSmall shareholders must choose between buying more shares as part of the new stock sale, accepting US$3 a share or trying to sell on the open market, where OSG has been trading at around US$6, the panel's lawyer, Steven Pohl, said in court on Tuesday.\n\nSmall shareholders do not have \"the cheque book or the stomach\" to keep their shares and buy more as part of the reorganisation plan, said Mr Pohl, a partner at Brown Rudnick LLP. \"We seem like the only people standing up for the little guys.\"\n\nMore time would allow small, retail investors to sell their shares to the hedge funds and other investors that are sponsoring the new sale, Mr Pohl added.\n\nOSG this month decided to pursue a reorganisation plan that provides a greater recovery to shareholders than its original proposal. A court-approved committee of shareholders convinced the company that raising about US$1.5 billion in an equity offering and about US$1.35 billion in exit financing was better than giving secured lenders ownership in exchange for debt.\n\nOSG has the largest fleet of tankers operating under the Jones Act, which regulates shipping among US ports. It holds an exclusive permit to transfer oil from large ships to smaller vessels in Delaware Bay and operates the only two US flag shuttle tankers in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Jones Act requires that at least 75 per cent of OSG's equity be owned by US citizens, according to court documents. The reorganised OSG will craft bylaws to limit foreign ownership to no more than 23 per cent to comply with the law.\n\nInvestors holding about 30 per cent of OSG's stock have agreed to act as a safety net for the share sale, guaranteeing that the full amount is raised. The group has also agreed to buy about US$447 million more in other securities, according to court papers.\n\nA group holding more than half of OSG's 7.5 per cent notes due in 2024 dropped its opposition to the plan last week after the company agreed to give them a piece of the share sale. The group agreed to buy as much as US$190 million to ensure that the full value is raised in the equity offering.\n\nUnder OSG's plan, shareholders that are accredited investors or institutional buyers would get subscription rights allowing them to buy 12 new Class A shares at US$3 apiece for each share of old stock, according to court papers.\n\nShareholders who do not qualify, or those who don't exercise their rights in the equity offering, would get a new Class B share for every one of their old.\n\nOSG plans to halt trading in its shares on June 3, to determine who is entitled to participate in the offering, according to court filings.\n\nThe company, based in New York, fell 4.8 per cent to US$5.60 on Tuesday in over-the-counter trading.

The areas in which tenders will be called include cybersecurity, infrastructure, system development and maintenance, data and analytics, cloud and mobile services.\n\nAt the annual industry briefing on infocomm initiatives in the public sector yesterday, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore's (IDA) Chan Cheow Hoe said the IDA would be looking at co-sourcing models where the industry would be partners in helping the government develop capabilities and solutions.\n\nMr Chan, who is IDA's assistant chief executive and government CIO (chief information officer), added that a multi-modal approach would used to accommodate innovation and to respond nimbly to complex demands for public services.\n\nThis year, 33 per cent of the tenders will be valued at between $200,000 and $500,000, and 22 per cent below $200,000. Out of the approximately 380 infocomm tenders that are likely to be awarded this year, 90 per cent will be valued below $5 million. This will mitigate risk and allow for faster completion of projects, according to IDA.\n\nJacqueline Poh, IDA's MD, observed that new technologies that emphasise speed and mobility are changing the way we live, work and interact with one another. \"Likewise, citizen-centric services need to be rolled out in a more flexible and responsive manner - in keeping with these rapid developments.\" Singapore, in keeping with citizens' expectations, needs to provide services which are as easy to use and intuitive as, say, Twitter or Instragram, she added.\n\nMs Poh observed that while the $1.2 billion amount planned for this year was the same as that for last year, there would be significant differences in how the money would be spent. \"We are looking to spend on initiatives that are progressive in nature. It will be done differently (this year), instead of large and chunky projects, tenders will be broken up into smaller ones.\"\n\nShe added that technology is moving at a very fast pace and people want to see the changes at lightning speed. \"We can no longer wait for two to three years to see changes. The modular approach will give more opportunities to smaller companies in some of our projects.\"\n\nShe, however, added that the intention was not to circumvent governance requirements which would remain in place regardless of the size of the tender.\n\nShe mentioned the recently announced Accre-dition@IDA programme which accredits promising and innovative Singapore-based technology product startups to establish credentials and position them as qualified contenders to government and large enterprise buyers. These companies will also be able to bid for some of the tenders.\n\nMr Chan observed that the government would continue to invest in technology to enhance service delivery to citizens and businesses. A bulk tender exercise - which is part of the $1.2 billion tender amount - will see 12 companies providing agile software development services and three companies agile tools to all public agencies.\n\nAgile software and tools refer to a development model that is based on iterative and incremental development where requirements and solution evolve through collaboration.\n\nMr Chan noted that this approach allowed system owners within the public sector to be more involved in the development process. Explaining the rationale behind the pre-selection of these vendors, he said that around eight to nine government agencies were looking at developing agile projects.\n\n\"Before, each would have done it separately and it would have taken six or seven months to get the project rolling and that would lead to some frustration.\n\n\"We have consolidated the needs together and said that as an estimate we are going to spend this amount during the year and pre-qualified a bunch of partners. Now, when the agencies are ready to call their tenders they can do so very quickly because all these partners are pre-qualified. This is an important first step to shorten the process while keeping the controls in place.\"\n\nOne example of a recent project created in an agile environment is the eCitizen Ideas! portal.\n\nApart from IDA, other government agencies also presented their infocomm procurement plans for this year. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will be investing more resources in areas such as video analysis, business analytics, modelling and simulation. The MHA will also continue to enhance or replace its existing operational systems.\n\nThe Ministry of Law and its statutory boards will be investing in their three-year ICT (infocomm technology) roadmap on 3D geospatial and integrated land information service.\n\nThe Ministry of Health noted that the majority of its planned IT investments for fiscal 2014 were in advanced stages of procurement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Companies seeking to reduce the number of days to close their books can choose to invest in technology as one of the ways to increase their efficiency.\"\n\nThe survey revealed that companies whose finance departments adopted best practices through technology achieved clear gains in overall productivity.\n\nISCA said companies that had a financial system capable of supporting internal and external accounting requirements took 30 per cent less time to close their annual accounts.\n\nThe results were obtained through an online and telephone survey between October and December 2013 and two focus groups in March and April this year.\n\nISCA said constraints were faced in terms of sample size as the survey marks the first attempt to obtain benchmarks of productivity indicators adapted from Spring Singapore's Integrated Management of Productivity Activities (Impact) framework.\n\nIn total, 221 professional accountants in business provided data for the accounting and finance functions in their companies from across industry clusters in manufacturing, retail and construction, among others.\n\nThe majority (59.9 per cent) of respondents were small and medium-sized companies with annual revenue of less than $100 million each.\n\nThe Singapore companies were compared to a global peer group in the SAP benchmarking database made up of 1,541 companies, with 41 per cent of them from North America and 27 per cent from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSeventy-eight public accounting firms also responded to a separate component of the survey.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was despite a 97.3 per cent, or $8.3 million, fall in fair-value changes of short-term investments to $234,000.\n\nRevenue for the property and retail group edged up 4.3 per cent to $49.7 million for the January-March final quarter due to higher rental income at Metro's property division, which saw turnover rise to $17.3 million from Q4 FY2013's $15.1 million.\n\nRetail sales of its Singapore operations were nearly flat at $32.4 million in Q4 FY2014 vis-a-vis $32.5 million in Q4 FY2013 against the backdrop of a competitive retail environment and a shorter shopping period in the run-up to Chinese New Year this year. The retail division's associated company in Indonesia reported steady sales for continued stores, although the weaker rupiah and higher operational expenses hit profitability.\n\nGross profit for the quarter under review inched down from $19.92 million to $19.83 million as the property division had reported lower operational costs in Q4 FY2013.\n\nThe unrealised gain from fair-value adjustments on investment properties (excluding associates) registered $20.02 million - versus a deficit of $3.93 million for Q4 FY2013 - mainly due to higher valuations for EC Mall Beijing and other investment properties, offset by lower valuations of Metro City Shanghai and Frontier Koishikawa.\n\nShare of associates' results contributed $18.05 million, compared to a loss of $2.03 million in Q4 FY2013. This was largely due to an unrealised gain of $20.4 million as compared to an unrealised deficit of $3.6 million in Q4 FY2013 from fair-value adjustments on investment properties of associates.\n\nFor the full year, net profit increased nearly 65 per cent to $106.85 million while revenue increased 3.82 per cent to $194.26 million. Earnings per share worked out to 12.9 cents, up from 7.8 cents.\n\nThe full-year results were helped by $40.5 million in fair-value gains from investment properties (including those held by associates), $29.6 million gain on disposal of a warehouse in Singapore and $19 million gain in negative goodwill on acquisition of an additional interest in the jointly controlled entities owning EC Mall in Beijing. Fair-value changes in short-term investments were a negative $5.3 million, against a positive $29.6 million in the preceding year.\n\nMetro chairman Winston Choo said: \"Our property division remains robust as we continue to expand Metro's footprint in China. The group will continue to seek new value-accretive business opportunities and add value to our existing portfolio of properties through asset enhancements to improve returns to shareholders.\"\n\nThe group has proposed a final dividend of two cents per share and a special dividend of four cents per share.\n\nThe counter closed at 98 cents yesterday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is necessary to consciously and deliberately re-align one's horizons downwards.\n\nI have recounted in previous columns the pleasure and delight provided by least expected wines, e.g. Vieux Chateau Certan 2007, Lynch Bages 2004 and many more. Their en primeur and current prices compared with the Firsts doubled the pleasure and enjoyment these \"lesser lights\" gave! An invitation, therefore, to dinner at which my host proposed a wine list of six non-Firsts 1990 Bordeaux wines was non-refusable. The wines: Chateaux Cos d'Estournel 2nd Growth St Estephe, Grand Puy Lacoste 5th Pauillac, Gruaud Larose St 2nd St Julien, Rauzan Segla 2nd Margaux, Magdelaine Premier Grand Cru Class (B), and L'Eglise Clinet, Pomerol. The only commune not represented was Graves.\n\n1990 opened the decade with a bang, echoing the bang made by the 1989 vintage which closed the decade of the eighties.

Its tenants will progressively open for business, with Swedish clothing retailer H&M being the first to welcome shoppers today. The mall will also be introducing other new brands, such as Uniqlo, Victoria's Secret, Melissa and Paris Baguette.\n\n\"These brands, which are making their first foray in the area, bring a dose of Orchard Road into the heart of Raffles Place,\" said Letty Lee, retail services director of CBRE Singapore, the project's sole marketing agency. Other tenants include brands such as The Hour Glass, Tumi, Pandora, Swatch and Owndays.\n\nOne Raffles Place, formerly known as OUB Centre, is developed and managed by OUB Centre Limited. Overseas Union Enterprise (OUE) has a 40.8 per cent stake in One Raffles Place through its 50 per cent interest in OUB Centre Limited. Besides the retail mall, One Raffles Place has two Grade-A office towers. The 62-storey Tower One, at 280 metres, is among the world's 100 tallest buildings. The humbler 38-storey Tower Two office building opened in late 2012.\n\nEarlier this month, when OUE announced its Q1 results, executive chairman Stephen Riady said the imminent completion of refurbishment works at the One Raffles Place mall and good progress of renovation at OUE Downtown will position the company to benefit from stronger recurrent income streams.\n\nCBRE said the location where One Raffles Place is situated has a catchment of around 259,000 working professionals and PMEBs (professionals, managers, executives, businessmen) as well as about 10,700 international tourists in 2014, thanks to an increase in office space and hotel developments in the vicinity.\n\nOUE shares closed nine cents, or 3.8 per cent, higher at $2.44 yesterday.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

The UAE is a federation of seven sheikhdoms, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital and holder of the vast majority of its oil reserves.\n\nThe grant comes on top of an 8.7 per cent stake taken by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development - a state body which provides cheap loans and grants for projects in developing nations - in the legal entity that will hold Etisalat's Maroc Telecom stake.\n\nSources had told Reuters in April that Abu Dhabi was providing a quarter of the funding for the purchase of the stake from France's Vivendi, with the rest coming from bank loans.\n\nEtisalat said last month that it had raised a 3.15 billion euro loan facility from 17 local and international banks, split between a 2.1 billion euro one-year bridging loan and a 1.05 billion euro three-year loan.\n\nThe bridging loan was always expected to be refinanced with a bond issue and Etisalat could start marketing that as early as next week, having chosen four banks to arrange the issue, four banking sources said.\n\nIt has chosen Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland to arrange the euro-denominated offering, the sources added.\n\nThese four banks could be joined by others from among the company's lenders as \"passive bookrunners\", three of the sources said, although they added that Etisalat had yet to decide how many banks would be given such a title.\n\nUnder such a scenario, the main bookrunners take charge of running the bond sale to investors.\n\nThe passive bookrunners play little or no role, but both will be paid an arranging fee by the issuer, with the main banks usually receiving a greater sum.\n\nThe bond issue, should it materialise, will be Etisalat's debut offering and is expected to attract significant investor demand, given its rarity value and high rating.\n\nIn a rating report last week, which classified both the company and the bond programme as Aa3, Moody's said that Etisalat's rating was \"amongst the highest for any rated global telecommunication service provider\". - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

But hardly anyone forecast the dramatic results that we have seen, in which far-right parties have outperformed centrists in such large and significant EU members as France and the UK. The gains made by other extremist parties elsewhere were also far beyond expectations. The results have been described as a \"political earthquake\" and for understandable reasons.\n\nIn France, the National Front party led by Marine Le Pen, which has openly campaigned on a xenophobic agenda, won 25 per cent of the vote and topped the polls. In Britain, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) led by maverick politician Nigel Farage - who wants the UK to leave the European Union - did better than the mainstream Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, picking up some 28 per cent of the vote. Far-right parties in Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and Greece will also be sending their representatives to Brussels, as will the Greek far-left Syriza movement, which garnered more votes than the mainstream parties.\n\nTo be sure, centrists will still control the majority in the 751-seat European Parliament. Also, it is not clear to what extent, if at all, the extremist parties can collaborate with each other; they do not share the same agenda, and some are simply nationalistic. However, their presence will be noticeable and will make a difference. At a minimum, it will make EU-wide legislation a more protracted exercise. The ability of the EU to forge trade and other agreements with other countries and regions may also be complicated. In this context, the Singapore-EU free trade agreement will be coming up for a vote by the new Parliament; how smoothly it goes remains to be seen.\n\nThe unusual EP election results, even if surprising, are not hard to explain. Since 2008, the EU (especially the eurozone) has been through an economic wringer, with austerity programme after failed austerity programme foisted on hapless citizens by dithering politicians. Unemployment rates have soared and even now, after a recovery is claimed to be underway, are at around 25 per cent in Greece and Spain, and close to 12 per cent in the eurozone as a whole.\n\nBut it is not just the economically ravaged countries where extremist parties have gained; this has also happened in countries with relatively strong economies such as Germany, Austria and Denmark. This suggests a region-wide disillusionment with the way the EU has been run. There may be more pressure for decentralisation. Thus, initiatives such as a fiscal union and a banking union - which need more centralisation - may become harder to negotiate. On the plus side, the constituencies against austerity policies will be stronger. All told, Europe's mainstream politicians have been given a wake- up call to the effect that they must deliver rather than dither. And that is no bad thing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company has taken the discussion a step further by giving details on gaps in SME financing and providing a comparative look at policies and experiences in other countries.\n\nNotably, it has suggested in a paper the formation of an independent SME development institution in Singapore - possibly by combining various existing agencies - with the power to: raise capital like a company; extend different forms of financing like a bank; and still operate like a strategic SME development agency to develop targeted sectors or companies.\n\nThe paper, Perspectives on Building a more Sustainable Financial Services Sector in Singapore, looks at SME financing in particular, amid its general examination of the overall viability of Singapore's financial services.\n\nIt notes that SMEs represent a cornerstone of Singapore's economy - representing 99 per cent of all companies here, and contributing some 50 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. SMEs here also employ about 70 per cent of the workforce, comparable to most parts of Asia and other OECD countries.\n\nYet, despite their relative importance to the local economy, SMEs here are allowed to fail at a worryingly high rate - especially when compared with some other Asian countries. McKinsey noted that a 2011 DP Information Network survey of 2,500 Singapore SMEs found that nearly half fail within four years; that equates to a 12.5 per cent annual failure rate, compared with a 6.25 per cent failure rate in Korea and 6 per cent in Taiwan.\n\nIt noted that there were three types of SMEs here that struggle to obtain financing: small enterprises expanding overseas; small enterprises with trade relationships or businesses in distant emerging markets; and technology companies seeking to scale up.\n\n\"Global studies show that financing is a critical enabler of SME growth, particularly during times of economic crisis or restructuring,\" the McKinsey paper said.\n\nLooking at case studies elsewhere in the world, McKinsey suggested three ideas worth exploring by Singapore to strengthen the sector:\n\nDr Teh Kok Peng, current chairman of Ascendas Pte Ltd and former president of GIC (Government of Singapore Investment Corporation) Special Projects - who provided the initial impetus for the paper - said in his foreword: \"It is my impression that that there has not been a lack of schemes and initiatives over the years to help SMEs. However, their complexity, insufficient co-ordination and continuity and fragmentation have hindered their effectiveness. From a business perspective, a single independent agency, well-resourced and staffed, would help greatly to overcome these difficulties. It would be a focused learning organisation, in touch with, and adapting to, the changing needs of the SMEs.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Credit Suisse is finding that clients who are high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in Asia Pacific account for a disproportionate share of its emerging market private wealth management lending activity. That, however, is a measure of its success in the region, says Hans-Ulrich Meister, the bank's head of private banking and wealth management, and also a member of the executive board.\n\n\"When I see lending success in the first quarter, it's proof that we (have) shifted especially to the Asia Pacific, where there is a big need among the client base to have lending.\"\n\nIn Q1 this year, the bank's assets under management (AUM) in the Asia Pacific grew about 5 per cent to 121 billion Swiss francs (S$169.3 billion), from 115 billion francs at end-December, 2013. Asia Pacific accounts for about a tenth of the total group AUM of about 1.3 trillion francs.\n\nHowever, in terms of net new lending to ultra high net worth clients in the emerging markets of 2.2 billion francs, the Asia Pacific's share was 30 per cent or 800 million francs. \"That gives you an indication of what we are talking about: an overproportion of investment and commitment to this part of the world,\" he said. In 1Q13, net new lending came to 500 million francs.\n\nThe bank defines the ultra wealthy segment as clients with at least 50 million francs with the bank, or a net worth of 250 million francs. These clients account for over 60 per cent of its Asian AUM.\n\nMr Meister said the region is an important growth market. \"We are highly committed to continuing to invest and grow our businesses in the region, and Singapore is where our largest private banking operations outside of Switzerland are based. Our private banking in Asia Pacific has done extremely well in building volumes in the last two years. More importantly, we have achieved it while significantly increasing our profitability, which provides us with a stronger base to continue to grow our business sustainably.\"\n\nCredit Suisse had earlier said it would allocate a greater proportion of risk-weighted assets to its private bank and wealth management business to substantially increase lending.\n\nMr Meister, who spoke to BT recently, said: \"When I look at the risk-weighted assets in the private bank, there is a clear shift to Asia Pacific, no doubt . . . Risk-weighted assets are a rare resource in today's banking world.\"\n\nHead of private banking (Asia Pacific) Francesco de Ferrari said there are generally three types of lending that the bank extends to private clients. One is traditional lending with a liquid collateral. This is tapped by clients to reinvest and enhance yields.\n\nA second is structured lending, which may be undertaken under a \"Solution Partners\" group with investment banking expertise. The services may include financing for large asset purchases or illiquid assets, and financial structuring such as risk hedging. Said Mr de Ferrari: \"It works very well because the client comes with a need. We understand this client's need; we proceed to structure it. Then we go to the risk book that is most appropriate for this particular risk.\" A third type of lending is for real estate.\n\nThe bank, meanwhile, has also made strides in reducing cost. Cost-to-income ratio in wealth management stood at 67.7 per cent in the first quarter, down 5 percentage points compared to 1Q13.\n\nMr Meister said the bank has been \"extremely successful\" in its cost reduction programme. \"We have a target till end of 2015 of 950 million (francs) in cost savings. We have now reached two-thirds at 630 million. This reflects our ability to achieve our cost-efficiency goals.\"\n\nHe believes that size remains an important success factor. \"What is important is volume; you need size. Even if you hear differently from competitors, if you don't have the size, you will not really be successful . . . I am still convinced that if you have less than 50 billion in AUM . . . you will not survive.\"\n\nHe said clients still hold \"quite a bit\" of cash at close to 30 per cent. \"This has to do with people's geopolitical assessment. They say even if cash is not an option in a low- interest environment, they hold cash.\" Clients, however, are investing in real assets such as real estate and classic cars.\n\n\"Generally, because of the low-interest environment, fixed-income products are not as attractive as they were. There is so much liquidity in the market. Generally, we are still quite clear you should overweight equities and all sorts of products linked to equities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Credit Suisse recently agreed to settle a United States tax dispute with a guilty plea and a payment of a US$2.6 billion fine. The bank has said that a conviction would not have a material impact on its operations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Modi has, so far, lived up to this expectation. He engineered a diplomatic coup of sorts by inviting leaders of the Saarc (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations and Mauritius to his swearing-in ceremony on Monday. This is a first by an Indian prime minister. And it was not just a symbolic gesture: Mr Modi got down to serious talks with each of the leaders the next day.\n\nIndia is a very important neighbour for all the countries and it was good that they got an opportunity to meet the new leader. The most important discussion Mr Modi had was with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. He did raise Indian concerns about terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil but the thrust of the discussion was on trade. Both leaders have won their elections with landslide victories and are business-friendly. They have the mandate to transform the bilateral relationship into one driven by trade rather than politics.\n\nMr Modi has got off to a good start on this issue. Apart from this foreign policy foray, the first decision Mr Modi took was to announce the formation of a special investigation team to probe black money, most of which is stashed abroad. Some estimates reckon India's black economy is worth between 50 and 70 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Modi's election slogan of minimum government and maximum governance has also resonated with the electorate. In keeping with this, he announced the smallest Cabinet that India has ever had. For synergy, he has clubbed related departments into one super ministry for better coordination. For example, road transport and shipping have been merged into one ministry, while urban development has been merged with housing and urban poverty alleviation. But while the start has been promising, it remains to be seen how Mr Modi and his team follow through. One of the problems the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party faces is a lack of experienced administrators. Navigating India's byzantine bureaucracy and getting things done can be a herculean task even for the most experienced leaders.\n\nThe other major challenge is reviving stalled economic growth. Mr Modi's win has been cheered by the business community, with India's stock indexes hitting historic highs as foreign funds flowed back into the country. However, this euphoria could be short-lived as there is no magic bullet to kickstart growth. India's slowdown from a peak of 9 per cent to less than 5 per cent is mainly due to a sharp drop in investment. A stable economic environment can help revive investment but it would still take three to four years for the effects to be visible and that too only if the global economic situation remains stable. How long Mr Modi's honeymoon period lasts is an open question. He must use his political capital wisely. His biggest challenge will be to ensure that the great expectations he has aroused in the Indian electorate are not quickly transformed into disillusionment.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It covers best practices to be observed, and the importance of keeping to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (Colregs).\n\nA statement announcing the pamphlet's launch noted that SOMS remains one of the busiest and most important shipping lanes in the world. It is a vital sea line of communication, carrying about one-third of the world's traded goods and used by ships voyaging from west to east. So not surprisingly, the publishers stress that \"safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment in the SOMS are of paramount importance\".\n\nIn a perfect world, where all masters and watchkeepers knew the collision regulations by heart and always conducted their vessels in a seaman-like manner, there would be no need for a SOMS guide. It does contain some local information but in general it reinforces behaviour that should be deeply engrained in all professional mariners anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, several recent incidents have highlighted the reality that we live in a far-from-perfect world.\n\nSafe Passage: The Straits of Singapore and Malacca was officially launched at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization's Maritime Safety Committee, held in London. It is the result of an initiative pursued within the Co-operative Mechanism, a framework established in 2007 which the littoral states and users of the SOMS pool their respective resources and expertise in an effort to enhance navigational safety and protection of the marine environment in the SOMS.\n\nThe pamphlet advises on collision prevention measures, night signals for vessels crossing the Traffic Separation Scheme in the Singapore Strait, local rules for ships transiting the SOMS and on anchoring and weather conditions affecting visibility such as haze and heavy rain.\n\nAgain, there is little there that competent professional mariners should not know anyway. Nevertheless, this is a useful guide and one aspect is particularly welcome.\n\nThe pamphlet makes a point that needs to be hammered home to all watchkeepers throughout the world fleet. It says that many investigations worldwide have revealed that VHF radio communication is one of the contributing factors in collisions at sea. It notes: \"In many of the so called 'VHF assisted' collisions, the 'VHF communication' between ships had created misunderstandings leading to close quarter situations or collisions.\"\n\nIt cautions: \"Mariners are reminded that compliance with Colregs is a much more effective way to avert a collision than the use of VHF communications.\" That sentence cannot be repeated often enough at nautical colleges worldwide.\n\nThe dangers of using VHF as collision avoidance tool have been underlined yet again by a recent report from UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) of its investigation of the collision of the container ship CMA CGM Florida and bulk carrier Chou Shan in the East China Sea on March 19 last year.\n\nAs these two vessels approached each other, the Chinese watch officer on the bulk carrier called the container ship on the VHF radio. The VHF conversations were conducted in Mandarin and were not fully translated into English to enable the watchkeeping officer on one vessel to understand what had been tacitly agreed.\n\nWhat had been agreed were alterations to port, contrary to Colregs. The MAIB has reminded the operators of both vessels that radio communications are not to be used as the sole or even the primary means for collision avoidance.\n\nUnfortunately, calling up vessels and discussing an impending close quarters situation has become a widespread bad habit. It is one that the industry must give up.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For Rosneft, it is an affirmation of the keenness of multinationals to do business with Russia, despite tensions over the crisis in Ukraine.\n\n\"Seadrill will remain the majority owner in North Atlantic Drilling. We have not thought about selling any shares. We have 70 per cent today,\" said Mr Troeim, a Seadrill board member, adding the firm intended to retain a majority stake \"for a long time\".\n\nMr Troeim made the comment after Rosneft boss Igor Sechin said his firm could take a stake of up to 50 per cent in North Atlantic Drilling over time. \"We are even more optimistic about the company's future after signing this deal.\"\n\nThe deal, which would involve using onshore and offshore rigs in Russia until 2022, would initially deploy up to nine offshore rigs for an overall commitment of 35 rig years, Seadrill said on Monday.\n\n\"Seadrill again pulls something extraordinary out of the hat,\" Fearnley Securities said in a note to clients. \"This is extremely positive. There are few details about how the contracts are set up and how the ownership structure will be. But for me and the market, this is a positive surprise,\" said Kristoffer Riis Iden, an analyst at Arctic Securities in Oslo.\n\nNone of the companies said how much the deal was worth but Mr Troeim said the deal was a \"game changer\" for North Atlantic Drilling, which specialises in drilling in harsh offshore areas.\n\n\"When Rosneft goes into the firm the idea is that this will be turned into an offshore company that will to a great degree serve Rosneft, which produces five million barrels a day and has activities worldwide,\" said Mr Troeim.\n\nHe did not expect sanctions placed on Mr Sechin by the United States in response to the Ukraine crisis to affect the deal, even though Seadrill is also listed in the US, as well as in Oslo.\n\n\"We will of course comply with international sanctions,\" he said. \"At the same time, this is a deal that was initiated long before the issue (of sanctions) became a topic and that will hopefully last long after a solution has been found.\"\n\nSeparately, Mr Troeim said he did not expect the market for rigs, which has declined slightly recently, to fall further.\n\n\"I am of course respectful of the fact that the market, in the short term, can be characterised by higher supply than demand, but I am not especially worried,\" he said.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Japan immediately lodged a diplomatic protest with China.\n\nChina's Defence Ministry reported on Sunday that the country's military scrambled fighter jets on Saturday in response to Japanese SDF aircraft entering an air defence identification zone that China had unilaterally established over the East China Sea last year.\n\nThe incident came just days after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had warned in a speech in Tokyo that such \"incidents can escalate and miscalculations can lead to unintended conflicts\", a concern that was echoed by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nChina was Japan's second-largest investment destination in Asia last year. In 2013, Japanese investments in China totalled 0.88 trillion yen (S$10.8 billion), down from 1.07 trillion yen in 2012, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed.\n\nOn Japan's economic prospects, Mr Nakamura said recovery in the world's third-largest economy was steady and there was enough momentum to overcome the consumption tax hike. In April, Japan hiked its consumption tax to 8 per cent from 5 per cent.\n\n\"Abenomics\", or the stimulus measures of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is working, leading to more investments by corporates and households as salaries rise, he noted.\n\n\"Japanese corporate profits are at a historical high now, the labour market is tight . . . (we) think Abenomics will work,\" he added.\n\nGrowth in 2014, which will be dented by the consumption tax hike, is still likely to be positive, at 1.2 per cent, after last year's 2.3 per cent.\n\nFor Q2 2014, the economy is forecast to fall to minus 4.7 per cent as consumption tumbles following April's sales tax hike, but it is likely to recover subsequently, supported by higher wages and more stimulus measures from the BOJ, he explained.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They need motivated Singaporean workers who can find meaning in their work, and will help take our SMEs to the next level,\" said Mr Teo, adding that the government would help SMEs to be \"employers of choice\".\n\nWhile the government will work with trade associations and business chambers to match graduating students to SMEs, he said that the companies themselves must ensure they are attractive employers.\n\nThey have to put in place good compensation packages, have good human resource practices and plan a rewarding career path for their staff, said Mr Teo.\n\nOn its part, the government was ready to support SMEs by helping them to access the required expertise and revamp their approach to talent management.\n\nGiven the small size of Singapore's economy, he made the point that businesses here should serve not just the domestic market but the rest of the world as well.\n\nSMEs, said Mr Teo, should ride on the growth of Asia, as well as the continued recovery in the United States and Europe, to seize growth opportunities.\n\nThe government will also expand its network of free trade and investment guarantee agreements to help businesses export and invest overseas.\n\n\"This is critical because Singapore is small and many of our businesses need to serve the international market to grow and thrive,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You can have that kind of cost advantage if, maybe, part of your costs are reflected in Kuala Lumpur and not in India.\"\n\nMr Kapoor was referring to a recent claim from AirAsia-India chief executive Mittu Chandilya that the airline would offer \"dramatically\" lower fares once it begins operations in the country from its headquarters in Chennai.\n\nIn a tweet early last week, AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes disclosed that New Delhi had finally granted his airline a licence to operate in India. He also told reporters that AirAsia-India would probably start operations in the third quarter of the year.\n\nIts licence was delayed by over a year after protracted resistance from local Indian airlines fearful of increased competition.\n\nIndian carriers, including SpiceJet, are bleeding from high input costs, primarily fuel prices, borrowing rates and dollar-denominated purchases amid a depreciating rupee.\n\nPut together, all airlines operating in India registered a combined loss of US$300 million as at September 2013, according to the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA). When AirAsia first applied for a licence to operate in India, the FIA objected, saying it feared that the entry of the new airline would cause the industry to incur further losses.\n\nNew entrants keep coming into the country, anyway. AirAsia and Singapore Airlines have both tied up with Tata Group for separate ventures, while Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways has bought a stake in Jet Airways after New Delhi eased investment rules in 2012, all of them eager to tap the potential of a 1.2 billion population.\n\nMr Fernandes, meanwhile, seems blithely sanguine about his prospects. Following years of expansion and franchising, his airline plans to increase its load factor to 85 per cent (from 81 per cent presently) and rationalise its fleet through aircraft sales.\n\n\"These next two years, we have the ability to enter up to 85 per cent,\" Mr Fernandes was quoted as saying by Malaysia's The Star newspaper. \"We see growth opportunities in the Philippine, Indian and Japanese markets.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It can be assumed that the signing of the contract will affect gas prices on the European market.\"\n\nRussia accounts for 30 per cent of Europe's energy imports; with the new deal, China will be Russia's second-biggest gas market after Germany, analysts said.\n\nThe mammoth gas deal is not just important for commercial reasons for both countries, but geopolitical ones as well, said Simon Hunt Strategic Services. \"In effect, the agreement binds the two countries in a commodity axis that will have widespread ramifications.\"\n\nEnergy consultant Wood Mackenzie noted that the deal to supply 38 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas annually from Gazprom's East Siberian fields to China via the \"Power of Siberia\" pipeline should come on-stream by 2020.\n\n\"The agreement not only establishes a new gas production centre in East Siberia for Gazprom, but provides the company with pipe export growth and market diversity away from its legacy European customers,\" said Stephen O'Rourke, a global gas research analyst for Wood Mackenzie.\n\n\"With European gas demand growth uncertain and the Ukraine crisis leading to calls for Europe to reduce its reliance on Russian gas, Gazprom now needs a 'new Europe', notably China.\"\n\nGazprom's exports to Western Europe hit 38 bcm by the mid-1980s. Since then, they have increased to more than 150 bcm, which goes to the whole of Europe, Wood Mackenzie noted. The firm anticipates that overall gas demand from China over the next two decades will grow more rapidly than that witnessed in Europe from the mid-1980s.\n\nEight provinces in north-east China, home to 360 million people, will receive East Siberian gas and by 2025 Wood Mackenzie estimates total gas demand from these eight provinces will reach 125 bcm.\n\nSiberian gas will meet more than a quarter of regional demand by this time, predicts the firm.\n\nThe Russia-China pipeline agreement proves that Gazprom can grow piped gas exports significantly without relying on its traditional European markets, and this illustrates the deepening of energy ties between Russia and China, along with the growth in oil, liquid natural gas, coal and electricity trade.\n\nMoreover, the Power of Siberia pipeline will enable Gazprom to pursue additional export projects aimed at other Asian buyers, Wood Mackenzie said.\n\nThe costs of a huge pipeline capable of transporting 38 bcm of gas a year to China will be shared between the two countries, said Gazprom's Mr Miller.\n\nThe gas supply agreement between Russia and China is worth more than US$400 billion over the lifetime of the deal.\n\nThe price at which gas will be supplied was not disclosed, but current deals with European utilities peg it at between US$350 and US$380 per 1,000 cu m, said analysts.\n\nThe state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation will be the importer and distributor of the gas.\n\nThe pipeline will also boost investment in both the Russian and Chinese economies. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia will spend at least US$55 billion to develop the necessary infrastructure in Russia; Beijing will allocate US$20 billion.\n\nVTB, Russia's second largest bank, signed an agreement with the Bank of China, one of the country's four largest banks, to pay each other in yuan and roubles, thus bypassing the US dollar, for their investment deals, inter-bank lending, trade finance and capital markets, said Simon Hunt.\n\nMr Hunt added: \"This is very significant and may well presage arrangements between other banks. What America's meddling in the internal politics of the Ukraine has done has been to cement and accelerate the ties between Russia and China.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the EU has said it will take steps to cut imports from Russia and unstable Middle Eastern sources.\n\nInternational Energy Agency executive director Maria van der Hoeven said in a series of speeches that Europe would ramp up its renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on oil, gas and coal.\n\n\"According to our Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report, electricity generation from hydropower, wind, solar and other renewable sources is projected to scale up by 40 per cent in the next five years,\" she noted.\n\n\"This means that by 2018, the share of renewable electricity will account for a quarter of the global power mix, up from 20 per cent in 2011.\n\n\"We also expect that by 2016 at the latest, global renewable electricity generation will overtake that of gas and will be twice that of nuclear, making renewables the most important source of electricity after coal.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But if you look at an expanded definition of wealth and legacy in terms of the family's capital, we perceive a gradual shift, where there is a more equal distribution of capital to other female family members. . .

If anything, regulatory intervention was sorely needed.\n\nA second qualifier is that while all markets need gamblers and speculators to provide liquidity and volatility, there has to be strong regulation to ensure a level playing field, especially so in a market where investors have placed considerable amounts of the their life savings, ie, Central Provident Fund (CPF) money.\n\nYou cannot lower regulatory standards and allow speculation to run riot when retirement money is at stake - even though there are caps in place on the amount of CPF that can be used for stocks. A responsible regime has to do its utmost to preserve order and discipline while encouraging \"investment\" in the strictest meaning of the word.\n\nThere's no denying that some speculation is needed to give daily trading that shot in the arm - the question is how much. There are no easy answers: tighten too much and business gets curtailed (as is the case now); relax too much and you risk being blamed for falling asleep at the wheel.\n\nFor example, does high-frequency trading (HFT), often criticised for being a purely speculative activity, have a role here? If so, should the activity be regulated - perhaps by means of a financial tax (which is the case in many other countries)? What about contra trading, perhaps the epitome of all speculative activity but one which retail players crave?\n\nFor its part, SGX should seriously consider gathering feedback from its frontline representatives on such issues, namely the brokers and remisiers whose role it is to sell the Singapore market to investors.\n\nThese are professionals who have intimate knowledge of what makes the local market tick, so their input in figuring out how much speculation is acceptable would be useful.\n\nIn an ideal world, the market should be filled by \"buy and hold\" investors who are in it for the long term but there should be some room for short-term punters too. It's true that in the long term we are all dead, but to paraphrase fund manager Marc Faber: \"We are all doomed - but this doesn't mean we can't make money along the way.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the majority of households, HDB flat values have the biggest potential impact, with 82 per cent of Singapore residents living in HDB flats.\n\nThe fall in the value of households' holdings of HDB flats came despite the continued increase in HDB dwellings last year by 2.4 per cent to 961,800 units, and a slight increase in ownership of HDB homes to 91.8 per cent from 91.7 per cent, with the remaining proportion renting.\n\nOn the whole, Singapore's household holdings of residential assets grew the slowest in eight years with a 1.8 per cent rise in 2013, compared with a 7 per cent growth in 2012 and 10 per cent increase in 2011. This came as the property market continued softening. Resale HDB prices have begun to soften even in mature estates such as Bishan and Queenstown. Both private homes and resale HDB flats have seen weakening prices respectively, in the past two and three quarters.\n\nThe household balance sheets data from the Department of Statistics looks at all household units including Singaporeans, permanent residents (PRs), foreigners and unincorporated enterprises while its data on housing dwellings factors in only residing Singaporeans and PRs.\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak noted that the growth in overall household assets in 2013 was slower than even during the property market trough of 2009 amid the global financial crisis.\n\nHDB values have \"reached an inflexion point\", engineered by a large supply of build-to-order (BTO) flats, stricter mortgage rules and a three-year waiting period for newly minted PRs to buy resale flats, he said.\n\nBut Mr Mak noted that most HDB flat owners hold their units for the long term, so short-term fluctuations in HDB prices may not trouble them. \"Only those who want to sell their HDB flats now will be concerned,\" he said.\n\nIt should also not be worrying to a majority of households that have paid off their mortgages. In fact, many HDB dwellers are still sitting on paper gains from the uptrend since 2006, market watchers say.\n\nResale HDB prices have surged some 95 per cent between 2006 and 2013 while households' holdings of public housing assets grew a compounded annual rate of 9.5 per cent over the past eight years.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng pointed out that despite the recent decline in resale HDB prices, prices are still at near-record highs.\n\nHowever, property experts are expecting a further softening of resale HDB prices amid new flats being released under HDB's BTO and Sale of Balance Flats schemes. Buyers of newly completed private housing may also decide to let go of their HDB units. This could have further implications on household balance sheets.\n\n\"Our projection is for resale HDB prices to soften by 5-8 per cent over the whole of 2014,\" said ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim. \"Lower resale prices will lead to lower valuation prices.\"\n\nWhile the risk of households falling into negative equity is now remote, further declines in asset prices could hurt those who have pledged their assets for loans - an area where there is no clear picture as no data is available.\n\nCiti economist Kit Wei Zheng is questioning if older individuals have pledged their private property assets to obtain more leverage, since data from MAS and the Credit Bureau showed rising debt burdens among those in their 30s to 50s.\n\n\"We suspect that the surge in debt levels with age may provide circumstantial evidence of increasing prevalence of asset-based (as opposed to income-based) borrowing amongst older borrowers,\" he said in a recent report.\n\n\"Given the earlier entry point of this age group into the property market at lower price levels (and greater proportion of mortgages repaid), it is also likely that this group has a larger share of overall housing equity in the economy, which it has likely tapped to obtain more personal loans,\" he added.\n\nMr Kit noted that such practices, if prevalent, \"could exacerbate the feedback loop between falling asset prices, falling net worth, forced deleveraging, and further declines or volatility in asset prices\".\n\nDBS Group economist Irvin Seah reckons that those who have over-extended themselves in mortgage loans are still the minority.\n\nThe total debt servicing ratio (TDSR), which caps the total debt obligations of borrowers at 60 per cent of gross monthly income, has significantly reduced risk of households over-stretching themselves in mortgage loans and prevented borrowers from pledging their assets for loans, he said.\n\nBT understands that banks have been undertaking stress tests on their exposure to the property market as required by MAS.\n\nThe burden of deleveraging will likely cause households to cut down on discretionary spending, Mr Kit said.\n\n\"With over 70 per cent of mortgages for owner-occupation and average loan-to-value ratios of 47.5 per cent, the risk of a substantial rise in NPLs (non-performing loans) is probably limited in our baseline scenario of a fairly tight labour market, even if house prices fall 10-15 per cent.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While a surge in biomedical manufacturing output helped to offset a contraction in the electronics sector, industrial production overall slowed in April to grow 4.6 per cent year on year.\n\nThe Economic Development Board (EDB) said the semiconductor drop - the first year-on-year contraction in the sector's output in over a year - was \"due to firm-specific factor\", but declined to share the name of the company, the specific reasons for the output fall, and the nature of the company's operations, citing company confidentiality reasons.\n\nWhile EDB characterised the disruption as \"a one-off event\" and stressed the continued attractiveness of Singapore as an investment location for electronics companies, the fact has left analysts wondering why it even happened at all. That's especially when the impact is expected to linger.\n\n\"Although this is a one-off event, the decline will be registered in the year-on-year growth for the rest of the year,\" the government agency said.\n\nIn the absence of further details from EDB, analysts were left to decipher April's industrial performance; none of the experts The Business Times spoke to could suggest which firm was behind the cutback in semiconductor production.\n\nSaid DMG analyst Edison Chen: \"It's quite puzzling. To affect the entire semiconductors (segment), it must be quite a big event.\"\n\nMajor semiconductor players here include Broadcom Corporation, Infineon Technologies and GlobalFoundries.\n\nSaid Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho: \"We interpret this to mean a permanent, one-off reduction in production capacity in this area.\"\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah wondered whether the news reflected a \"hollowing-out\" of the semiconductors segment. \"If a plant has closed down, what were the reasons behind this? Was it simply one firm's one-off decision? Or does it have to do with something broader, which hints at the competitiveness of (Singapore's) economy, or structural issues?\"\n\nBut in response to queries from BT, EDB director of electronics Terence Gan said: \"We are confident that Singapore remains an attractive investment location for electronics companies. It is important to reiterate that this is a one-off drop, attributed to a single company, and for reasons specific to the company. We continue to see investment interest. Even the specific company itself is growing in Singapore in other areas.\"\n\nUOB economists Ho Woei Chen and Francis Tan were also optimistic about the electronics sector. \"On the whole, we believe that outlook for the electronics sector remains positive given the improvement in the purchasing managers' index from the US, while the US semiconductor book-to-bill ratio stayed above 1.0 in April for the seventh consecutive month.\"\n\nEven though last month's industrial production growth slowed from March and February's showings, the 4.6 per cent expansion still reflected a faster pace than the market consensus. Economists polled by Bloomberg before EDB released the numbers yesterday had been expecting industrial production to rise by 4.3 per cent.\n\nExcluding the volatile biomedical sector - which, with an expansion of 23.8 per cent, was the main driver of growth - output would have fallen 0.7 per cent year on year.\n\nApart from the electronics sector, all other manufacturing clusters - biomedical, chemicals, precision engineering, transport engineering and general manufacturing industries - posted year-on-year increases in output.\n\nGrowth in the transport engineering cluster moderated sharply to 3.5 per cent in April, following two consecutive months of strong double-digit expansion. Economists had expected the slowdown, given the lumpy nature of the marine and offshore engineering segment.\n\nEDB said that after adjusting for seasonal factors, industrial production decreased 4.7 per cent month on month in April. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output would have fallen by a larger 7.3 per cent.\n\nThe contraction was larger than private-sector economists had forecast - they had been expecting industrial production to fall 4.3 per cent in April from March, on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n\nEconomists largely expect industrial production to average around 5 per cent for the rest of the year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Frontier markets' (FMs) stock markets are now trading at a premium to the more developed emerging markets (EMs), but offer a higher dividend yield and lower volatility. These will be themes to be discussed at the Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) Annual Global Ideas Conference from today until Friday in Singapore.\n\nIn 2013, 19 of the world's 20 fastest-growing economies were frontier countries. FM countries could add an estimated US$1 trillion in GDP over the next five years: this opportunity is too significant to ignore. We believe FM economies will sustain growth as they are starting from lower bases with relatively low levels of government debt and manageable fiscal deficits.\n\nFMs have a history of low correlations to other markets and low volatility. As illustrated in Display 1, over the past five years, FMs have had a low correlation to both emerging and developed markets. The 30 main FMs have also shown little correlation to each other because valuations, economic cycles and development are at different levels and stages. This is why we believe in a macro- based, top-down approach that determines which FMs to invest in, and which to avoid.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

According to IT research agency Gartner, global expenditure on mobile advertising is expected to hit US$18 billion, an increase from the estimated US$13.1 billion last year. North America and Europe lead mobile marketing's growth, overtaking the Asia-Pacific region, which had enjoyed an early lead in recent years due to the high adoption of handsets.\n\nIt was on this upbeat note that the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) held the sixth edition of its Forum here last Thursday. About 250 delegates came together from across the region to discuss the role of mobile in the consumer world.\n\nRohit Dadwal, MMA Asia-Pacific managing director told BizIT: \"Five years ago, our time was spent convincing marketers of mobile's efficacy as an advertising and consumer engagement medium. With the exponential growth of mobile, it is no longer a nice-to-have element in a marketing campaign but rather a must-have and is a key factor driving innovation in marketing.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the current market size of mobile advertising is pegged at US$15.5-17 million. According to a survey carried out by MMA and Digital Market Asia, this represents 9-11 per cent of the total advertising expenditure across all digital platforms. Global players in this space continue to do well. Digital market research company eMarketer, projects that Google's mobile ad revenues will make up 46.8 per cent of Google's total revenues this year while Facebook told BizIT that \"mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 59 per cent of advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2014, up from approximately 30 per cent of advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2013\".\n\nMr Dadwal added: \"The conversation has now shifted towards how we can build capabilities and power the ecosystem to leverage mobile, which will continue to push marketers to re-think the way they approach marketing and to use data and technology to engage with consumers in a relevant way.\"\n\nEngaging customers effectively was the common thread that ran through the one-day forum. Keynote speaker Lau Seng Yee, president, online media group, Tencent Holdings, discussed the disruptive role that mobile Internet has played in China and how mobile has transformed from \"touch points\" to \"cash points\". He also pointed out how the role of brands has evolved from being mere \"persuaders\" to \"enablers\" for their consumers.\n\nFacebook's Asia-Pacific managing director, Myungjo Choi, discussed the trends impacting m-commerce with examples demonstrating how mobile marketers in the region have used mobile to increase visibility for their business. He also urged marketers to be thoughtful in their use of the mobile channel and to push for high quality creatives that are relevant to target audiences.\n\nIn another session, Beverly Harrison, principal scientist in mobile at Yahoo Labs, gave a sneak preview of what is brewing in their California headquarters. Some of the new software in the works include apps that will \"learn\" the consumer's daily technology and content consumption habits and deliver functions that will enhance both work and lifestyle via their mobile devices.\n\nAltogether, more than 20 experts in mobile marketing shared their views with an audience of fellow marketers poised to seize the exciting times ahead.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The military has taken into custody scores of politicians, activists and others.\n\n\"Will we go back to where we were before? If you want to do that, I will need to use force and impose the law strictly,\" Gen Prayuth said in a statement he read on television. \"You will have to forgive any tough measures as they are necessary.\" He did not set a timeframe for how long the army would stay in power, although he said he hoped to hold elections soon.\n\nThe royal endorsement is a significant formality in Thailand, where the monarchy is the most important institution.\n\nGen Prayuth, wearing a formal white dress uniform, said he would set up a council of advisers but gave no details on the form of a government that will run the country under his military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order.\n\nThe military ousted the remnants of a government that had been led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra until she was removed by a court on May 7 for abuse of power.\n\nSmall crowds of people voicing opposition to the coup have been gathering daily in Bangkok since the takeover, as well as in the north and northeast, strongholds of the ousted government. But there have been no serious clashes.\n\nYesterday, several hundred people gathered at Bangkok's Victory Monument where about 1,000 protesters massed on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests are a nuisance for the army, a more serious threat would be armed resistance from \"Red Shirt\" loyalists. They have always threatened to fight a coup but with so many of their leaders detained or in hiding, activists say they have no plan for opposition.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy premier who led protests that undermined Ms Yingluck's government, was released on bail, his lawyer said. He had been held since the coup.\n\nThe army has also allowed Ms Yingluck to go home, although she remains under military supervision with soldiers guarding her residence, a military official said on Sunday.\n\nFor now, the military is focusing on ending dissent and getting the economy back on track.\n\nShares in building contractors jumped more than 3 per cent yesterday on expectations the military government would speed up disbursements for infrastructure projects that were put on hold during the months of political unrest.\n\nAmong them, Italian-Thai Development pcl, the country's largest construction firm, rose 0.5 per cent even though the army had summoned its president, Premchai Karnasuta, to appear yesterday, along with 37 others including political associates and business allies of former premier and brother of Ms Yingluck, Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nAlso yesterday, the military officer overseeing the economy met senior economic civil servants. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

By Georgine Verano\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR the corporate executive who sees no value in exercising or claims to be too busy to hit the gym, Jon Denoris is here to change his mind. Mr Denoris, celebrity UK fitness trainer and self-proclaimed sports \"scientist\", who has a master's in Exercise Science at Roehampton, University of Surrey, among other sports-related qualifications, is used to working with busy people. After all, most of his clients have hectic schedules, from executives to celebrities. \"The Pop-Up Gym was a natural evolution from working with busy executives who don't have a lot of time, and who needed a solution for it,\" says Mr Denoris. \"It's a workout they can do if they have 10 minutes in a hotel room, no equipment needed.\"\n\nMr Denoris has done over 15,000 one-on-one coaching sessions since becoming a trainer. As one who specialises in psychology and mental performance, he is more than qualified to advise the busy executive who desires not only a healthy body but a sharper mind.\n\nThe Pop-Up Gym has also blossomed into a book of the same name, which took him about two years to put together. Noticing the similarities between elite sportsmen and business people, he took some of the principles that he learnt and developed the book with the aim of using those strategies to help people with busy lifestyles. For Mr Denoris, it's all about consistency. \"I try to help people understand, there's no reason not to exercise.\"\n\nBringing the Pop-Up Gym to Singapore was a natural move for him. \"I think it's a natural fit for Singapore, as the pace of life here is similar to that of London's. Living in a city is the same everywhere - you've got stress, pressure, long days, travelling and so on, and the Pop-Up Gym caters specifically to people with that lifestyle.\"\n\nMr Denoris notes that one reason executives and professionals may not exercise often is the lack of motivation and inability to see how it benefits them. \"The media often portrays exercise as something for the young. If you look at most of the images about fitness and gyms, it's often about body parts, not necessarily about what's going on internally.\"\n\nMr Denoris believes gyms can be a little daunting for older people, because of the perception that it is a young person's environment. \"When older executives look at gyms, it probably doesn't resonate with them because they don't see anything they can associate with,\" he says. \"I think gyms, and health clubs need to do better jobs of engaging people, for some of those really important benefits.\"\n\nOne example is how exercise gives you more energy. \"People who constantly travel, especially for business, need to realise that exercise gives you energy, and energy is the currency of high performance.\"\n\nSo, if you're a business executive, it's about managing your energy, not your time, according to Mr Denoris.\n\n\"When someone says they're too tired to exercise, they don't understand that exercise gives you back that energy, if not more,\" he adds. \"While travelling on business, a half-an-hour exercise session in your new timezone helps to reset the body clock and relieve jetlag.\"\n\nExercise not only gives you energy, but also allows one to be at the peak of their performance, or as Mr Denoris puts it, being \"battleproof\". A common misconception is that exercise relieves stress - it doesn't. \"What I do is increase their tolerance for stress,\" says Mr Denoris. \"I make them more resilient, so they can better cope with the stresses they're going to have.\"\n\nExercise has also been proven to increase concentration as well as allow people to be more creative - it has been shown to stimulate neurons in the brain that are responsible for creativity - and focused. \"It's these mental performance parameters that give our clients the edge over their peers,\" adds Mr Denoris. As for professionals who say they don't have enough time, Mr Denoris suggests starting with 10-minute exercises.\n\n\"Typically, I try to teach my clients to be regular exercisers,\" he says. \"Instead of going to the gym and doing a long work out, start small, with 10 minutes a week, then twice a week for two weeks. Then build it up from there.\"\n\nMr Denoris believes that people are more likely to become regular exercisers when they do it consistently, as their personal efficiency increases after seeing some success in the few short sessions. \"Gradual change leads to permanent change.\"\n\nThis applies to older executives as well. \"As people get older, they naturally start to think about their health more, they notice they can't do the simple things as easily anymore,\" he says. \"So their motivation is more to be able to walk with their grandchildren, or play football with their kids.\"\n\nSo for them, his training focuses more on \"functional exercise\" - pushing, pulling, lifting and incorporating them into daily life. It could be something as simple as a brisk walk, or one of the Pop-Up Gym Sessions, he says.\n\n\"The routines in my book are really quick to do, and research has shown that even just a few minutes of exercise can be enough to derive a health benefit,\" he says.\n\n\"The key is to keep them as simple as possible, so clients can't come back and say 'I can't do it because I have no time' or 'I'm too old.' \"\n\nMr Denoris believes that the problem with fitness and gyms is that older people find that they try to do too much, too soon. \"We have a more measured approach, because we believe that you have to be in it for life.\"\n\n\"Fitness exists within a health paradigm,\" he says, \"Sports people understand that, that if you're not healthy, you can be fit for a short time, but it's only a matter of time before you get an injury or something will break down in the body.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he laughs, \"If you read my book, you'll be in the best shape of your life, as an added benefit to the health of your body and mind.\"\n\n.The Pop-up Gym is available in major bookstores in Singapore, priced at $29.91 (after GST).

What changes are needed to its various schemes?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, May 25, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTomas Urbanec\n\nCEO\n\nPrudential Singapore\n\nTHE CPF scheme continues to be robust and effective in serving the savings and retirement planning needs of Singaporeans.\n\nHowever, as the concept of retirement evolves, more flexibility may be needed to meet the changing needs of Singaporeans. Needs differ, and although the official retirement age is 62, depending on their individual circumstances, some may choose to retire earlier . . . or later. The Fund can allow for members to start drawing down from their Retirement Account at the time that they declare themselves as ''retired''. This could mean stoppage from full-time work or it may mean supplementing their income as they continue with part-time work.\n\nThe Fund could also allow for members to choose how they would like to redistribute their monies among the different CPF accounts. As a major provider of integrated shield plans, Prudential understands the concern that Singaporeans have with rising medical costs. Increased medical expenses can also be expected as the population matures. Allowing for this flexibility to increase the funds in their Medisave account could help some Singaporeans meet their medical expenses.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE CPF began with a mission of being a retirement savings plan, which makes it compulsory for Singaporeans to lock in savings for their golden years. Over the years, it evolved to cater to Singaporeans' various financing needs. Some initiatives - such as its role in home ownership and health care - are great ideas and very useful, practical applications of the funds.\n\nHowever, I find other usages such as the purchase of stocks and other financial products to be less fantastic. Sure, individuals who are financially savvy may be able to grow their savings through such financial investing but others who lack sound financial knowledge may get burnt and lose a part of their hard-earned savings in the process. Thus I feel that instead of continuing to branch out further, perhaps the CPF should streamline its policies and focus back on its original mission and develop schemes that help members grow their retirement savings in a prudent fashion while minimising any risk that the savings might get eroded through bad investment choices.\n\nPeople are also generally living longer these days; and given the rising cost of living and inflation, I'm not sure if the Minimum Sum (which will be raised to $155,000 in July) is ever enough if a person retires at 55 years of age and lives for another 15 or 20 years. Perhaps the government can look into implementing a compulsory annuity plan that every Singaporean must subscribe to at an earlier age, when the premium would be lower, and the premium can be paid using the person's CPF monies.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nTHE CPF scheme was established to help Singaporeans support themselves after retirement; it was not conceived as a comprehensive social security plan. Over time, it has evolved to take on new roles. Today, it supports home ownership and health care; it also provides a vehicle for investment and can even be used to fund a child's education in Singapore.\n\nIt has in some way proven to be resilient and effective, and it fulfils these functions through a range of schemes. One clear priority for CPF reform therefore is to introduce a strong programme to support, educate and guide citizens on the various schemes. With more avenues of information and knowledge of their various options, citizens can learn to be engaged stakeholders in their own CPF management. As we spur our citizens to be better trained and prepared for the ever changing working world, there could be a scheme where CPF is available for overseas training and education. Continuous improvement in health care coverage should be a top priority.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE original aim of the CPF to provide for retirement should be preserved and promoted as much as possible.\n\nTo the extent that much of our CPF has been used for property purchases, more can be done to introduce and promote schemes, such as reverse mortgages, to allow members to monetise their assets when they are in their golden years. For all intents and purposes, it is tantamount to drawing on the contributions of forced savings.\n\nWith hindsight, given the appreciation of property prices in Singapore, allowing the use of CPF funds for property purchases has been a wise and clever move. If there is one prudent use of CPF which can be maintained, it is this scheme. Property in Singapore has been an appreciating asset.\n\nOverall, I am in favour of keeping the number of CPF schemes to a minimum. It should be limited to low-risk areas that can make a difference to the lives of CPF members, such as for their health care and their children's education.\n\nThe use of CPF to purchase equities, even approved shares, should be stopped. The guiding principle for any full review should be that CPF as a social security plan is also an investment, as well as an insurance, for a better quality of life, for the members' future. If this is applied as a sacrosanct principle, it is not difficult to decide on what to include and what to exclude for its uses.\n\nChris Wei\n\nGroup CEO\n\nGreat Eastern Holdings\n\nTHE CPF has provided Singaporeans with a much-needed sense of security and confidence in their old age. However, with many competing demands for finite CPF monies, and with life expectancy and health care costs on the rise, there is a real danger that CPF savings may be depleted prematurely. It is timely to take a look ahead at how CPF savings can be better used to work harder for Singaporeans to continue to enjoy financial independence.\n\nWith a holistic review on the cards, a compelling case can be made for introducing a reverse mortgage option and for enhancements to the Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS).\n\nA reverse mortgage allows homeowners to tap into their home equity and can, when used responsibly, be an effective retirement planning tool to provide a steady stream of monthly income over a sustainable period. Much public education is required for this to be a more accepted option and, when used with other financial solutions, Singaporeans could still achieve their intention to pass on the family home to the next generation.\n\nAs for DPS, a study by the Life Insurance Association of Singapore showed that the local protection gap stands at about $200,000. To plug this gap, DPS can be re-designed to offer customers the choice of different and higher sums assured compared with the current fixed quantum of $46,000; allow supplementary benefits to be added such as coverage for critical illness and income protection, and increase the maximum cover age in tandem with the prevailing retirement age.\n\nRobert Wilkes\n\nManaging Director\n\nTowers Watson Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nWITH respect to retirement savings, the CPF provides a solid foundation. However, Towers Watson's Global Workforce Study - last completed in 2012 - identified that only 50 per cent of employees in Singapore feel comfortable providing for their retirement income needs. Focus, therefore, should also be placed on encouraging voluntary retirement savings outside the CPF to improve retirement security - the framework for employers to implement vehicles that enable additional employee savings, for example, is in need of review.\n\nKarthik Tirupathi\n\nCEO\n\nNapier Healthcare\n\nTO meet the impending silver tsunami, some enhancements to existing CPF schemes can be considered. The world over, technology-enabled ageing-in-place solutions such as home-based medical care are increasingly becoming a viable option. Today, technology can be leveraged to enable preventative, transitional and palliative care within the comforts of a patient's home. Expanding the reimbursements for initiatives covered by Medisave can increase the adoption of such homecare services. Innovative technology-enabled healthcare initiatives such as telemedicine and tele-consulting, including the use of remote health monitoring devices, can be considered under this expanded scope of Medisave.\n\nSupport for such healthcare initiatives will undoubtedly ease the overcrowding in hospitals, polyclinics and nursing facilities. Remote patient monitoring can significantly reduce hospital re-admissions in patients with chronic conditions, while promoting productivity of hospital operations. Most importantly, the ageing population of Singapore will have an additional option to age gracefully and independently at the place of their choice.\n\nAllen Ang\n\nMD\n\nAldon Technologies\n\nAS contributors to workers' CPF, businesses play an important role in ensuring its effectiveness as a comprehensive social security system. Up until recently, the CPF has been effective in meeting workers' needs of sufficient retirement funds, home ownership and affordable health care. But now, higher living costs are affecting the sufficiency of workers' CPF savings - especially those in the low and middle income groups - to meet housing and healthcare needs. The government could consider raising the employer's contribution rate for monthly income up to $3,000. Under this scenario, in return, the government should give SMEs - which are already severely hit by rising costs - double tax deduction for their CPF contributions to offset the already very high business costs.\n\nIn order to cool demand and rein in rising property prices, the government should consider allowing people to use their CPF to buy their first home only and not for second or subsequent homes.\n\nMany people lost money under the CPF investment scheme, defeating its purpose. In order to ensure that the value of workers' CPF savings continues to rise, the government should limit the use of CPF for investment to funds which can guarantee returns and disallow CPF investment in stocks, some of which are volatile and speculative.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nSINGAPORE'S CPF model is ever evolving to cater for social and economic changes, and the introduction of certain policies over the years reflects this. With an ageing population and low birth rates, a review of the CPF system is essential to continue to maintain members' financial security.\n\nAn obvious issue to me is that property values have seen substantial growth over the years, to a point that many locals can be described as ''asset rich, cash poor''. This gives rise to the idea of allowing residents to draw on the value of their homes via reverse mortgages, allowing them to enjoy later life without financial constraints. However, it must be noted that action must be taken at the grassroots levels to ensure that the situation Singapore is in right now does not replay itself. Therefore one option that the government must consider is to raise CPF contributions for everyone.\n\nThis decision must not be taken lightly, as any increase will have a direct impact on local businesses' contribution at a time when they are already dealing with rising business costs.\n\nThe change in demographic model also means that updates will need to be made to the current healthcare policies due to the inherent pressures associated with an ageing population. Things to consider include introducing elder-friendly facilities at hospitals and residential homes; additional training for hospital staff and introduction of an elder-care community schemes.\n\nWe at Castlewood Group predict a huge future investment in retirement villages and communities, and will definitely be focusing our attention on this growth sector. These new schemes will be essential to achieving the level of care expected by Singaporeans but that will prove costly so changes will have to be carefully monitored, and it is likely that tweaks to new policies will be made if any negative knock-on effects are revealed. It is not in Singapore's best interest that a major overhaul is introduced all at once; we have to ensure that every change is effective before we decide what our next move is.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman / Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nWHILE the CPF has improved over the years, the costs of living have risen even more, especially housing and medical expenses. This has posed difficulties for the lower and middle income workers who depend on their CPF savings to pay their housing loans and medical expenses (including the medical insurance charges). The withdrawal limits have further compounded their problems. Perhaps the government can consider abolishing the withdrawal limits. This can help Singaporeans pay for the above-mentioned costs (that constitute the lion's share of the living costs), without burdening the taxpayers. With the more expensive housing and medical costs settled, people may be able to work at a more suitable pace and still have money left for retirement.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nTHERE is no better time than now to look at enhancing the CPF scheme as clearly its initial purpose of ensuring that Singaporeans enjoy financial independence in old age now seems inadequate and requires a new strategy. One of the biggest worries of Singaporeans is the ability to sustain, much less improve, their livelihood after retirement. No doubt the government has put forth various plans to address this, through schemes such as the Pioneer Generation Package, universal insurance and many more.\n\nHowever, our CPF savings are just not sufficient for the ever rising costs of living. The lion's share of our CPF is being emptied into property from the Ordinary Account, leaving only the smaller Special Account for retirement purposes. Two ways to generate more money to cover retirement is to start reducing the portion allowed for property purchase and allocate more of the contribution into the retirement account.\n\nIn addition, create a robust scheme to make monetisation of one's property more straightforward, with decent alternative living arrangements such as subsidised rental units within a retiring community with the needed facilities for one's golden age.\n\nA successful revamp of the CPF is possible, but we have to act fast as Singapore evolves ever rapidly. Time waits for no man.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nCPF is a sacrosanct institution that must remain conservative and risk-adverse. The examples of other countries' health plans, particularly in the US and UK, have great learning points for Singapore. Universal application does not necessarily mean health care for all citizens. The CPF may need to evolve to provide more allowable expenses for geriatric treatments as the population ages.\n\nSingapore's CPF funds can be deployed for investment as well as property purchase. Personally, I would have preferred that the investment deployment be limited. Many investment options may not necessarily generate better returns and instead subject the CPF funds to the vagaries of the markets. I have seen many Singaporeans lose a substantial part of their CPF funds to investments because they were persuaded to invest in portfolios unfamiliar to them.\n\nCPF is a great invention, a savings plan with multi-disciplinary facets and uses. Health care and home ownership are two of a citizen's most important financing needs. The CPF should reflect that.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN the animal kingdom, only one rule guides them all - lunch.\n\nBy that token, they're not all that different from humans, laughs Aidi Abdullah - self-taught naturalist, former flight instructor and veritable guardian/curator of the lush living exhibit that is Langkawi's Kilim Karst Geoforest Park. To hear him tell it, a day in this rich, wild ecosystem sounds like a day in the office - with its occupants slugging it out to get ahead, establishing a hierarchy, changing to stay relevant and survive, forming cliques and looking for tasty things to eat at meal times.\n\nThe whole scenario plays out in a three-hour boat tour of the Kilim Karst - the kind of landscape that only Mother Nature can carve out on a good day. Or in this case, over 500 million years. That's how old these limestone formations are - once solid rock whittled down by acid rain-and-salt dissolution into a breathtaking series of jagged cliffs, with rivers forming between them in the geological process. But what really ups your respect for the power and mystery of nature is the sight of the flora and fauna whose genetic make-up evolved against the odds over millennia to become the flourishing species seen today.\n\nTake the mangrove trees, explains Abdullah as the powerboat we're in quietly nudges against a tangle of reeds and roots forming an impromptu barricade. Growing where no normal trees can, mangroves are like the kampung houses of the swamps - sitting firm on roots pushing up over the water like gangly stilts. Thanks to an ingenious membrane over their roots, saltwater is filtered out and nutrients are sucked in which send these strapping tall specimens growing up into the sky.\n\nAnd how about the mudskippers - fish engineered to \"walk\" on the muddy shores by pushing themselves with their pectoral fins, their balloon-like gills acting as an air tank. Or skittish fiddler crabs with their trademark single large claw like a musketeer with a hand behind his back and a sword in the other. They're everywhere - darting into little holes when they're not chomping incessantly on unseen tidbits. If you're lucky (we weren't), dolphins and otters make an appearance, but even without them, the sight of mighty brahminy kites soaring overhead is a sight to behold, unless you're a fish under the water's surface, that is.\n\n\"When you look at the sheer beauty and scale of this little corner of Langkawi - it would be a terrible shame to lose it,\" says the weather-beaten Abdullah who scans a speeding boat cutting across the water with some resignation. The geoforest park has already got a Unesco stamp on it, and Abdullah is working with them to maintain the status. He's already drawn up a list of tasks - chief of which is to enforce speeding limits on powerboats to prevent damage to the fragile environment.\n\nThe erudite 50-something is so well-known on the island - officially he is the resident naturalist at the upscale Four Seasons Resort Langkawi - that he is the go-to guy for both tourists and scientists who want to know a little or a lot about the natural wonders of this self-contained island that's a quick ferry or plane ride from Penang. The only ones who hate him are the monkeys. Not the cute dusky-leaf primates with their bright orange babies - \"so their parents can pick them out in an emergency\" - but the calculative macaques who seem to be as calculative whether they're from MacRitchie or across the Causeway.\n\nYou can literally see the scorn on their faces as Abdullah's boat passes by. They look away, only to perk up when another boat comes by, filled with tourists bearing snacks. \"They know I won't feed them,\" he says. \"So they don't bother with me.\"\n\nFor the former flight instructor and photographer, the call of nature has been an all-consuming one, which is why when the Four Seasons asked him to join them as a naturalist in 2004, they didn't have to ask him twice. He and his two proteges organise the resort's highly popular Mangroves and Eagles boat safari, while also manning its geoforest discovery centre on the sprawling beach front grounds that has an unfettered view of Kilim Karst.\n\nHis philosophy is a perfect fit for the Four Seasons with its emphasis on sustainability even as it doesn't cut any corners on the luxury front. It's got one of the nicest spots on the island, with individual villas bigger than some apartments, complete with a view of the Andaman sea. Sunset photos are a shoo-in, as you can easily get your best shot from a vantage spot at the Rhu Bar (with a commensurate cocktail) or out on the beach itself where a Rajasthani tent can be set up to take the concept of private dining a step further. In another setting, the tent would come off as cheesy, but here it's surprisingly laid-back and natural. And there's no denying the allure of a personal barbecue served to you, and a finale of toasting marshmallows over a little bonfire.\n\nThe sustainability factor extends to the food, particularly at the restaurant Ikan Ikan, which prides itself on serving locally caught seafood and rustic Malaysian specials such as rendang cooked according to the chef's family recipe. Holistically inclined appetites can seek out simpler repasts in the GeoSpa's bento box lunch - personalised according to your Chakra which is determined through a simple questionnaire. Light soba noodles, salmon or tofu, pumpkin puree and a quinoa coconut dessert add up to portion-control goodness.

It's less commercialised, the kampuong vibe is still strong, and you get the sense of being in a beach resort that doesn't feel specifically Malaysian or Thai, which is actually nice.\n\nAnd, if you're so inclined, Langkawi is duty-free.

He put Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong in charge of the key economic ministries the day before.\n\nA military official said that King Bhumibol Adulyadej would today endorse Gen Prayuth as leader of the ruling military council, a significant formality in a country where the monarchy is the most important institution. On Saturday, the army said that the king had \"acknowledged\" the takeover.\n\nGen Prayuth takes charge of an economy that shrank 0.6 per cent in the first quarter as seven months of unrest have sapped consumer spending and slowed growth in industrial production. A nationwide overnight curfew is discouraging tourists who were already wary about visiting the capital because of political violence that has killed at least 28 since November.\n\nThere were protests over the weekend in Bangkok and Chiang Mai in defiance of martial law that was imposed two days before the coup.\n\n\"The task at hand now is to boost the economy, which is in pretty bad shape,\" Thanavath Phonvichai, an economist at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok, said yesterday. \"Low-income earners have no money, which is mainly a result of delayed payments under the rice-buying programme. NCPO is handling this problem now and this should help sustain the economy from falling further.\"\n\nAt the meeting yesterday, officials discussed overdue payments to farmers under the rice-subsidy programme and measures to accelerate state spending and plans for the next fiscal budget, Thai Bankers' Association secretary-general Thawatchai Yongkittikul told reporters after the meeting.\n\nApart from the immediate task of shoring up the economy, the country's new leaders also have the unenviable job of countering increasing resistance from coup-weary locals.\n\nYesterday, the NCPO said that anyone accused of insulting the monarchy or violating its orders would face military court.\n\nAn army spokesman warned against protests and told the media to be careful in its reporting too. \"For those who use social media to provoke, please stop because it's not good for anyone,\" deputy army spokesman Winthai Suvaree said.\n\nDespite the warnings, a small crowd of protesters formed outside a central shopping mall in the morning and grew through the day.\n\nHundreds of soldiers, most with riot shields, lined up to contain the crowd and there was some shouting and pushing and at least two people were detained, a Reuters reporter said. By late afternoon, about 1,000 people had gathered at the Victory Monument, a major city intersection.\n\nThe coup is expected to dent investor confidence and the central bank will monitor the new government structure and assess their plans for the economy, Mr Prasarn said last Friday.\n\n\"Once the economy is being supported, sentiment should pick up,\" said Mr Thanavath. - Bloomberg, Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

By Rachel Loi\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN we think of Johor Bahru, we think of cheap makan, cheap groceries, and cheap car washes - all good reasons to brave a potential traffic jam just to get across the Causeway. But what if you're looking for a quick getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life instead? Enter Traders Hotel - a 4-star brand of the Shangri-La Group - which is located right beside the waters of the Puteri Harbour. While the hotel's target clientele are businessmen making a pit-stop in Johor, it also works as a destination for Singaporeans who might want to just relax for a weekend. And, of course, having free speedy Wi-Fi, private massage spa, and access to a rooftop infinity pool never hurt anyone.\n\nFor now, the hotel can be accessed via a half-hour car ride from the Tuas Checkpoint in smooth traffic. But more transport options are slated to open up soon, once the Puteri Harbour International Ferry Terminal begins direct trips to Singapore's HarbourFront Ferry Terminal - a development that was intended to materialise this June. But other than accessibility, another reason the hotel makes a great choice for a getaway is that its location boasts a scenic view of the harbour that, for a second, makes you feel like you're in a totally different part of the world.\n\nTo maximise this view, the rooftop of the hotel features an infinity pool facing the harbour, as well as the SkyBar restaurant, where you can have a sitdown dinner and drinks against a sunset backdrop. If you prefer an indoor dining option, then you could grab a bite at the Lobby Lounge, or check out The Harbour Cafe for your daily buffet breakfast.\n\nThe latter seats up to 250 people, and on most nights it serves an international dinner buffet - RM98++ (S$38) per adult. The highlight, however, is the impressive spread of cold and hot seafood that the cafe serves on Friday nights, complete with sashimi, Alaskan King Crab and a delectable dessert bar (RM 108++ per adult).\n\nBut if you feel like venturing out for food instead, there are restaurants, cafes and even a Starbucks outlet - all within a five-minute walk along the harbour.\n\nAs for the hotel's 283 rooms, they might not be considered luxurious but they are definitely well-lit and spacious. The large windows face either the harbour or the courtyards, and the view can be comfortably admired from a handy bay window sofa.\n\nAnd since it was just built last year, the four-storey hotel has adopted a clean and modern look that matches its four-star image, while its hallways are decorated with batik-inspired artwork mostly made out of wood.\n\nFor families with restless kids, the hotel also happens to be conveniently located near attractions such as Legoland (five-minute drive) and Sanrio Hello Kitty Town (three-minute walk). Otherwise, a five-minute drive will bring you to Kota Iskandar, where you can take a tour to see the pineapple-shaped dome where Johor's state parliament takes place.\n\nAlternatively, you could hop into a cab for the Johor Premium Outlets (about RM70 per trip) which are just a 10 to 20-minute drive away. There you will find over 80 brands such as DKNY, Hugo Boss, Guess and Salvatore Ferragamo. These entertainment options are in fact the main reasons that half the business hotel's clientele have been leisure-seekers.\n\nAs general manager Sigi Bierbaumer puts it: \"Traders Hotel, Puteri Harbour, is the perfect place for a staycation just across the border of Singapore, especially for those who have a need to get away from the busy city.\" And he just might be right.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The broad S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs in the wake of the housing data.\n\nNew home sales rose by 6.4 per cent to a stronger than expected 433,000 in April while used home sales rose 1.3 per cent to 4.65 million. While both fell from last year's levels, the showing was deemed positive given prices and mortgage rates are both rising.\n\nInvestors were also relieved to hear the Federal Reserve strike a market-friendly tone in the minutes from its April meeting. While acknowledging that interest rate hikes are on their way, most board members are at pains to appease markets with promises of maintaining low interest rates and stability.\n\nAs long as inflation remains muted, it's unlikely the Fed would make the mistakes committed by central bankers in the 1970s who damaged economic growth with rate hikes.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco president John Williams said it's unlikely the Fed will raise rates before the middle of 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn one sign of growing complacency, the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, or VIX, also hit one of its lowest post-recession levels last week. The VIX, or \"fear gauge\", is a measure of the premiums traders are willing to pay for the \"put options\" that would protect them in the event of a broad market slide. For most of the last five years, the fear gauge was elevated.\n\nTraders always had one eye on a descending crisis: the near-collapse of the eurozone, several US budget crises, war in Ukraine. While Ukraine remains on the brink of civil war, Russian President Vladimir Putin now appears less eager to internationalise the conflict. Could the stock market be returning to the \"normalcy\" of the 1990s and 2000s when entire months passed by without the word \"crisis\" appearing in business news channels?\n\nNot quite yet. Underneath the calm surface, there are some signs of lingering unease. The Russell 2000 index of small caps, which had soundly beaten the returns of the large-cap indexes for years, is now lagging far behind the performance of the safer blue-chip peers.\n\nOther niches such as biotechnology and social networking have plunged in value even as their broader sectors - healthcare and technology have gained.\n\nThis is a market that prefers giant financiers such as AIG over risky regional banks such as Zions Bancorp; a market that favours old-line tech giants like Hewlett-Packard over startups like Twitter; a market that skews to defensive sectors like utilities and away from cyclical favourites such as steel makers.\n\n\"A stealth correction has been unfolding in the market,\" warned analysts at brokerage Piper Jaffray. While they retained bullish targets for the year, they said the correction in the Russell 2000 will likely extend to the S&P 500 and Dow in the short term.\n\nOne strategist said investors are rotating into blue chips and out of small and momentum sectors for a simple reason: dividends. Bond investors have lost patience with Treasury market and are hunting for interest payments elsewhere.\n\n\"One of the strangest things is that when we started the taper think six months ago, we all took it for gospel that the 10-year Treasury yield would be at 3.5 per cent,\" said Joe Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. \"Here we are, six months later, at 2.5 per cent. What you've had is many people selling Russell 2000 stocks that have had a nice run and investing in . . . Dow type stocks because they're searching for yield.\"\n\nThis week, traders await tallies of durable goods orders reports and housing starts for confirmation the economy is compensating for lost production during the wintry first quarter. As long as the Fed was cutting rates, investors could ignore slow growth, but now the market is in a \"show-me\" mood.\n\n\"Investors want to know, as the Fed continues to draw down the purchases, that growth is picking up,\" said Quincy Krosby at Prudential Financial.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There were 14 companies recording 27 purchases worth $3.1 million, and three firms with seven disposals worth $1.8 million.\n\nThe number of companies and trades on the buying side were sharply up from the previous week's four-day totals of nine firms and 18 purchases.\n\nOn the selling side, the number of firms and trades were consistent with the previous week's three companies and five disposals.\n\nIn terms of turnover, the buy and sell figures were sharply down from the previous week's purchases worth $9.67 million and sales worth $10.2 million.\n\nWhile the buying by directors rose last week, buyback activity fell with seven companies posting 16 repurchases worth $12.8 million.\n\nThe number of firms and trades were near the previous week's four-day totals of eight firms and 16 transactions.\n\nThe value, on the other hand, was consistent with the previous week's turnover of $10.1 million.\n\nThere were several significant corporate shareholder trades last week with buybacks in Nam Cheong, KTL Global, and SingTel.\n\nOn the directors' side, there were key insider buys in property-related plays Figtree Holdings, Sim Lian Group and Sing Holdings.\n\nOn the selling side, there were insider sales in Centurion Corporation and Pacific Radiance.\n\nNam Cheong\n\nShipbuilding-yards operator and vessel chartering services provider Nam Cheong bought back for the first time since its listing in 1999 with two million shares purchased on May 23 at 38 cents each. The trade was made on the back of the 56 per cent rise in the share price since April 2013 from 24 cents.\n\nThe counter is also sharply up since December 2011, when it was 11 cents.

Earnings for the full year rose by 4 per cent to $3.65 billion.\n\nThe group previously acquired 402,000 shares on Feb 17 at $3.59 each.\n\nPrior to the buybacks this year, the company acquired 4.05 million shares from May 2010 to May 2013 at $2.95 to $4.08 each or an average of $3.29 each, 14 million shares from May 2006 to May 2009 at $2.62 to $3.71 each or an average of $3.12 each, and 60 million shares from March 2000 to March 2001 at an average of $2.34 each.\n\nThe stock closed at $3.84 on Friday.\n\nFigtree Holdings\n\nChairman and managing director Danny Siaw, executive director Tan Chew Joo, and lead independent director Lee Kim Huat moved in to support the share price of commercial and industrial facilities designer and builder and property developer Figtree Holdings after the stock plunged by as much as 43 per cent from 43 cents on May 15.\n\nThe three directors acquired a combined 1.79 million shares from May 20 to 21 at 29.5 cents to 24.5 cents each or an average of 25.3 cents each.\n\nThe purchases were significant as those are the first trades by a director of the company since the stock was listed in November 2013.\n\nDespite the steep fall in the share price, the directors' purchase prices were higher than the IPO price of 22 cents.\n\nMr Siaw picked up 50,000 shares on May 20 at 29.5 cents each, which increased his direct holdings to 63.474 million shares or 22.87 per cent of the issued capital.

Earnings for the first nine months fell by 6 per cent to $111.12 million.\n\nThe purchase by the CEO this month was made at higher than his previous acquisition prices based on the 83,000 shares that he acquired in January 2013 at 76 cents each and 3.97 million shares from January 2002 to December 2012 at 24 cents to 74 cents each or an average of 36.4 cents each.\n\nThe counter closed at 87 cents on Friday.\n\nSing Holdings\n\nCEO Lee Sze Hao resumed buying shares of property developer and investor Sing Holdings at lower than his acquisition price in February, with 653,000 shares purchased from May 19 to 21 at an average of 37.3 cents each.\n\nThe trades, which accounted for 72 per cent of the stock's trading volume, increased his holdings (direct and deemed) to 147.651 million shares or 36.82 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nHe previously acquired 1.82 million shares from Feb 14 to 18 at an average of 44.4 cents each.

The disposals were made at sharply higher than the IPO price of 90 cents. The sales were also made after the company announced on May 14 a 110 per cent gain in first quarter profit to US$17.321 million.\n\nMr Mok unloaded 50,000 shares on May 19 at $1.22 each, which reduced his direct holdings to 54.950 million shares or 7.57 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nMr Yong, on the other hand, sold 200,000 shares on May 19 at $1.22 each, which lowered his direct stake to 28.665 million shares or 3.95 per cent. That sale was made at a huge profit based on the 1.12 million shares that he acquired in November 2013 at 88 cents each.\n\nThe director sentiment is not entirely negative this quarter as independent director Goh Chong Theng purchased 30,000 shares on April 4 at $1.10 each, which increased his direct holdings to 0.080 million shares or 0.01 per cent.\n\nThe stock closed at $1.18 on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Backed by vast foreign reserves, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has kept inflation in check, developed a deep capital market and well-regulated banking market. It has also facilitated the Singapore dollar becoming one of the world's top 15 actively traded currencies.\n\nGDP growth is expected to remain high at this level of development.\n\nThe agency also noted Singapore's fiscal and macro-prudential rules to stem rising property prices.\n\nDepository institutions' domestic claims on the resident private sector rose to 132 per cent of GDP in 2014 from 86 per cent in 2007. Continued credit growth at this pace, it warned, would risk creating imbalances in the economy and exacerbating swings in economic output.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under Basel III, trade loans being short term in nature attract lower risk weighting.\n\nLow historic loss rates and short loan maturities lead most to the view that trade finance exposure is relatively low risk in nature, it said.\n\nA 2014 Bank of International Settlements study noted that loss rates on trade finance data during 2008-2011 - which included the Lehman crisis - was just 0.01 per cent.\n\n\"With domestic growth opportunities constrained, Singapore banks see the need, and indeed are well positioned, to capture growing Asian regional flows in both investment and trade, in which China is a major driver,\" it said.\n\n\"Versus longer term investment loans, banks such as DBS view short tenure trade loans as lower risk, with significant cross sell fee opportunities in foreign exchange, treasury and even cash management as part of a broader global transaction services strategy,\" it said.\n\nAs equity capital becomes increasingly expensive, banks likely will continue to migrate to a more risk weighted asset-light growth model (trade loans typically carry a 20 per cent risk weight) while cash management contributes to the growth of \"sticky\" funding.\n\n\"When US and global rates eventually normalise, widening of trade margins and leverage on low cost funding may be a material positive for banks' net interest margins and earnings.\"\n\n\"DBS has led its peers in this regard, yet markets have apparently failed to reward them. DBS is our top Singapore bank pick for its broad-based earnings model (not just China) and reasonable valuations,\" it said.\n\nDBS has cited satisfaction with the quality of its trade/China exposures (DBS China/HK: 35 per cent of 2013 loans, 26 per cent of profit before tax).\n\n\"We like DBS's broad-based earnings model, with multiple growth engines (not just China), plus reasonable valuations (10.7x price earnings ratio, 1.1x price to book). But we concede markets may continue to assign a 'China banks price earnings ratio' (c.5x) to this part of DBS's earnings.\"\n\nDBS stock performance, year-to-date is in negative territory while that of United Overseas Bank is up about 6 per cent. UOB is least exposed to China among the three local banks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Comfort's gain over the five days was 10 cents or 4.4 per cent at $2.38 and SBS's gain was 30.5 cents or 24 per cent.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government announced large-scale changes to the public bus service model, changes that would benefit all these operators as it would involve tendering out bus routes to private operators, thus removing loss-making bus services from the books of existing operators.\n\nIn its report yesterday on the revamp, OCBC Investment Research said the key implication of this is that revenue risk will now be transferred to the government instead of the public transport operators (PTOs).\n\n\"Only 20 per cent of existing buses will be tendered out initially, while the remaining 80 per cent of buses will continue to be operated by the incumbent operators,\" said the broker.\n\n\"Overall, we believe this will enable the PTOs' bus operations to return to profitability and (we) expect ComfortDelGro (CDG) to be a bigger beneficiary than SMRT. In light of these positive changes, we upgrade the land transport sector from 'neutral' to 'overweight'. We maintain our 'buy' rating on CDG (fair value lifted from $2.30 to $2.56) and 'hold' rating on SMRT (fair value lifted from $1.25 to $1.40).\"\n\nMaybank Kim Eng, however, is more contrarian in its view. In its report on the transport changes, it said the market would likely look to price SMRT and CDG on a \"sustainable level of earnings\". Although this raises its target prices for the two stocks, Maybank Kim Eng said SMRT is still a \"sell\" with 80 cents target price based on 15 times earnings.\n\nAs for the Straits Times Index, its 12.36 points rise to 3,278.02 yesterday meant that it recorded a 16 points gain for the week. Volume was a weak 1.6 billion units worth $1.1 billion and excluding warrants, there were 246 rises versus 157 falls.\n\nElsewhere in the market, popular Myanmar play Yoma Strategic's shares sprang to life yesterday, rising eight cents to 80 cents with 65.4 million traded. There were no prior announcements to account for the move.\n\nThere were, however, two \"buy\" reports on Thursday issued by DBS Vickers and CLSA, with price targets set at $1 and 97 cents, respectively.\n\n\"Yoma remains one of the best proxies for Myanmar property, where housing demand continues to be robust,\" said CLSA.\n\nElsewhere, China water treatment firm HanKore's shares sprang up by 15.5 cents or 17 per cent to $1.085 with 13.4 million done. The company recently underwent a 10-into-one share consolidation. The jump prompted a query from Singapore Exchange.\n\nIn its daily report yesterday, financial research firm Ideaglobal said it has learnt that Fed officials are discussing the concept of a 3 per cent Fed Funds peak on a multi-year basis once tightening eventually starts.\n\n\"This reflects an assessment that the equilibrium real interest rate is likely to be around one per cent, which means 3 per cent Fed Funds once you take account of the Fed's PCE Inflation objective of 2 per cent.\"\n\nThe firm also said central bankers are becoming nervous that volatility is too low, with some markets now back towards 2007 levels.\n\n\"The hunt for yield in G10 markets has prompted a clear reduction in risk and a desire to sell volatility to collect premiums. Market participants also blame central banks for providing so much liquidity that it is producing insensitive to all but major risk-off events.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The year's starting quarter has been exceptional with the shipbuilder pulling in new orders totalling 5.5 billion krone, an indication that it's mostly on track to match last year's contract wins of 14 billion krone.\n\nRevenue fell short of estimates, dipping 3 per cent to 2.7 billion, no thanks to unfavourable timing in the delivery of vessels. The bane of rising cost dented bottomline with net profit falling over 50 per cent.\n\nOperating margins at 6.4 per cent over the period may be an improvement from the past three quarters' but way off the sustainable range of 8-10 per cent, laments DBS Vickers analyst Suvro Sarkar in a report following Vard's results announced in end-April.\n\nIt may be comforting, however, that Vard shares the quarter with other players who revealed uninspiring financial scorecards as well - namely, Swiber Holdings and Sembcorp Marine. Maybank Kim Eng Research, however, is holding out for a better quarter ahead for Vard on the back of a recovery in the OSV space which translates to better margins and given its niche in high-end sophisticated vessels.\n\nVard shares closed unchanged at $1.005.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCAN art bought at the Affordable Art Fair go up in value and make you a tidy profit? Yes, a small percentage of it certainly can and does. But buying art for investment runs contrary to the spirit of the Affordable Art Fair, which wants to make art available and accessible to everyone - not just the well-heeled and financially savvy.\n\n\"Think of art less as a financial investment than an investment in who you are and how you think. Art can take you to a different place, away from the hubbub of financial speculation. It's a great release and it's good for your soul,\" says Will Ramsay, founder of the popular fair which takes place annually or biannually in 13 cities.\n\nYesterday, Affordable Art Fair Singapore (AAFS) opened its doors to the public for its first fair of the year. Starting now, Singapore will have two editions of AAFS - one in May and another in November. The fair debuted in Singapore in November 2010 and has become so popular that it's doubling its occurrence.\n\n\"If you compare the situation to the stock market, it would be pretty risky to invest in an unknown company. So it's the same with buying art by lesser-known artists: it's a risk. If you really want to try to make financial returns - which is difficult because artists don't make 5 per cent year-on- year as companies aim to - you need to go with a better-known artist,\" says Mr Ramsay, 45.\n\n\"Still, you could think of yourself as a benefactor of the arts and a sponsor of artists. Think of yourself as investing in your life, your culture, your personal reflections . . . Even if it's a risk buying works by new artists, art is still more interesting to look at than a share certificate.\"\n\nArt pieces sold at the Affordable Art Fair Singapore (AAFS) are priced between $100 and $10,000, with 75 per cent of the works going for below $7,500. The artworks range from the very good to the mediocre to the kitschy. But there are always exceptionally strong pieces by well-known artists at the fair, including works this year by veteran artists Goh Beng Kwan and Kumari Nahappan, as well as notable emerging artists like Edwin Koo and Matthew G Johnson.\n\nHidden gems\n\nIn the past four years, there have been talented young artists who made their fair debut at AAFS, and have since seen their prices grow in tandem with their reputation. They include Sarah Choo, Guo Yixiu, Trase- One, Jolene Lai and Hilmi Johandi.\n\nIn the 2011 edition, Galerie Sogan & Art debuted the works of Choo, priced at $350 to $1,800. She gained good word of mouth and the gallery returned the following year with more works by Choo, this time in the $1,500 to $2,800 price range. Most were snapped up. Choo subsequently won the Icon de Martell Cordon Bleu photography award in 2013. Her prices now range from $2,400 for a small artwork to $9,000 for a large painting.\n\nSimilarly, Guo first made her fair debut at AAFS 2011, also with Galerie Sogan & Art, with works priced from $2,000 upwards. She subsequently showed at Frieze London and was the youngest artist to participate in the Singapore Biennale 2013. Her prices have now inched upwards of $3,000.\n\nGuo says: \"The fair exposes young artists like me to the art market - an important experience for any artist who wants to be self-sustaining. It also connected me to many local collectors, including the budding ones who are just starting out. In many ways, it offers an invaluable experience for young artists.\"\n\nVera Wijaya, founder of Galerie Sogan & Art, says it is not participating in the fair this year as most of its artists are scheduled for overseas fairs and exhibitions.\n\nTop names hop on\n\nMeanwhile, AAFS's warm and unthreatening vibe has attracted even seasoned gallerists to participate.\n\nLily Phua, for instance, is the former well-loved gallery manager of Singapore Tyler Print Institute, who helped it make history as the only Singapore gallery to show at the prestigious Art Basel in Switzerland. Late last year, she became director of Q Art Management, a division of Q Framing Group, which does museum-quality framing for high-end art.\n\nParticipating in AAFS for the first time, Ms Phua is bringing some top names to her booth. They include local artist Genevieve Chua, whose museum-worthy installation Vespertine Vol 1 comprises a suite of 80 mounted slides on a Kodak slide projector, as well as hot Indonesian artist Nasirun, who has two sculptures priced attractively at $8,200 - his paintings typically fetch between $15,000 and $30,000 at auctions.\n\nAnother impressive new entrant to the fair is Nikei Fine Art, a high-end Japanese art gallery at Raffles Hotel which specialises in Japanese abstract masters like Toko Shinoda and Kukoku Tamura.\n\nOwner Hiroshi Kato says: \"Nikei Fine Art has always sought to introduce Japanese artists to Singapore and other regions. And though we do have exclusive premium artworks from renowned artists like Shinoda, I don't want to limit our artworks to a very niche, high-end market.\n\n\"We have artworks from Japan that are in the affordable range. So I thought, why not? Art is meant for everyone to appreciate and enjoy,\" insists Mr Kato.\n\nThough Mr Kato speaks in halting English and requires a translator for certain words, he and Mr Ramsay clearly speak the same language.\n\nArt for everyone\n\nMr Ramsay, after all, has a simple and noble creed: everyone should be able to buy and enjoy art. That creed was born after several bad experiences with English galleries in the 1990s where he was ignored by snooty gallerists. He recalls: \"Every gallery I went to had no information on the wall and no prices stated. No one approached me to talk to me, and I was afraid of asking the wrong questions. I thought, this is the most backward retailing sector in the world.\n\n\"People are always embarrassed about two things - art and wine - because they seem to be for the top end. But the wine market has achieved huge expansion by educating people on wine drinking and having little labels at the back explaining things . . . I wanted to do the same for art.\"\n\nIn 1999, Mr Ramsay created the first Affordable Art Fair in the UK which sold \u00a31 million (S$2.1 million) worth of art; that figure doubled the next year, and again the following year. Seeing how well the formula worked in the UK, he took the fair to New York, and found similar success. The formula of \"art for everyone\" is now working its magic in 13 cities including Milan, Amsterdam and Mexico City. The fair is set to expand to other Asian cities, though Mr Ramsay is tight-lipped on the details.\n\nLast year, the Affordable Art Fair Singapore sold $4.9 million worth of art - up from $4 million in 2012 and $3 million in 2011. Because of its rapid success, Mr Ramsay and the Singapore team led by Camilla Hewitson decided to go biannual. Besides Singapore, only two other cities - New York and London - hold two Affordable Art Fairs a year. Ms Hewitson says Singapore will have biannual editions of the fair for at least three years so that the team can assess its sustainability. The buying rate in the past four years, she points out, has been very high.\n\nShe says: \"We attracted 17,800 people to the Singapore fair last year, and about 30 per cent of them bought an artwork. For Hong Kong last year, we attracted 29,000 visitors - the highest among all our fairs - but only 7 per cent of them bought an artwork. So we're optimistic about the outcome of going biannual in Singapore.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nAffordable Art Fair Singapore, May edition, is now on till Sunday at the F1 Pit Building.

We are going to reduce our rate by 10 percentage points within several years,\" he said through a translator.\n\nMr Nishimura was speaking at a seminar to discuss the progress and direction of Abenomics, the economic policies advocated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe since he took office in December 2012. The forum was organised by the Japanese embassy here and the Japan External Trade Organisation.\n\nThe reforms planned by Tokyo, based on big government spending, central bank monetary easing and structural change, aims to reverse 15 years of deflation and sluggish growth in the world's third-largest economy.\n\nMr Nishimura, 51, said that Tokyo plans to further cut the effective corporate tax rate next year, and that details of the quantum of the cut and the time frame are still being worked out.\n\nThe government is also looking into eliminating what he called \"unnecessary preferential treatment\" in tax issues.\n\nSome analysts say that the government would have to secure alternative sources of revenue as a result.\n\nJust last month, Japan's sales tax was raised from 5 per cent to 8 per cent, in what was the country's first such hike since 1997.\n\nThis caused a sharp dip in domestic spending, especially on big-ticket items such as cars and homes, but Mr Nishimura said that the public's reaction so far has been within the government's initial expectations.\n\n\"We want people to overcome this first phase of increase, and for the economy to recover first,\" he said in response to questions from The Business Times.\n\nHe indicated that the cabinet would take a decision this December on whether the levy will be raised again to 10 per cent next year: \"We have to look at many factors before we decide, such as the GDP gap, the consumer price index and wage trends.\n\n\"Increasing by five percentage points in the space of over a year is a major thing, and will have quite an impact on our economy.\"\n\nHe added that the government would tread with more caution on a second hike in the sales tax than with the first one.\n\nMr Nishimura also took the opportunity to lay out the welcome mat to foreign investors, including those from Singapore, urging them to consider expanding into Japan in the coming years. \"We believe this is the last chance - and a big chance - for the Japanese economy to change and grow. We are committed to larger reforms that we were not able to tackle before.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SATS had last year unveiled plans to buy SCC from Temasek, but announced last week that it was pulling out of the deal.\n\n\"It was based on developments in the Asian cruise market and subsequently, we talked about the growth in the large technical cruise ships coming to Asia,\" Mr Hungate said, in a reference to the recent announcement that Royal Caribbean would offer year-round sailings from Marina Bay Cruise Centre (MBCC). SATS owns MBCC.\n\nThe global cruise operator, which has its Mariner of the Seas vessel at MBCC during the northern hemisphere's winter months, now plans to move its Legend of the Seas ship to Singapore during the summer months too, in a nod to Singapore's status as a year-round cruise centre.\n\nMr Hungate said: \"This way, we can start to make money - hopefully, all the way through the year.\" He noted that previously, losses in the summer months would drag down the stronger performance from the winter months.\n\nIn a report dated May 14, Phillip Capital's analyst Richard Leow wrote that with the industry going for larger ships, SATS would likely be unable to realise the returns it previously envisaged through the investment in SCC.\n\nThis is because the existing HarbourFront Terminal, which SCC owns, is unable to accommodate larger ships because of the height restrictions imposed by the Sentosa cable car line.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Samuel Ee looks at what makes it special\n\nPublished Fri, May 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE design of the BMW i8 is both revolutionary and functional. It has a new purpose-built structure comprising a carbon fibre reinforced plastic shell with a thermoplastic outer skin that is bolted onto an aluminium chassis. The body with its show-stopping wing doors also has perfect aerodynamics (0.26 drag coefficient). There are no add-on spoilers and only small front openings and a hidden exhaust, in keeping with its green credentials. Because while the i8 may be a sports car, it is first and foremost a plug-in hybrid. There is a turbocharged 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine behind the two back seats with a starter generator to drive the rear axle, as well as an electric motor in the nose for the front wheels. This makes it a four-wheel-drive car but one with only an electrical, not mechanical, connection between the two axles.\n\nAll-wheel-drive not only contributes to swift progress but superior traction too. The i8's 49:51 front/rear weight distribution also makes it an ideal sports car. With two people in the car, the weight distribution becomes a perfect 50:50.\n\nThe electric motor is located in front to enable better energy recuperation because of the higher load under braking. When driving spiritedly, the starter generator provides a 50 Nm overboost for two seconds to match the front motor during kickdown. This takes place in Sport mode, when the battery is always charged to at least 80 per cent to enable the boost function. The other driving modes are Comfort and Eco Pro, which offer either all-electric or hybrid options.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Readymade drinks supplier Super Group was flat at $2.86, while United Overseas Bank was 0.09 per cent, or two cents, lower at $22.35.\n\n\"So far, the recent developments in Thailand have minimal impact on the Singapore market or stocks,\" said OCBC head of research Carmen Lee.\n\nUOB Kay Hian research head Andrew Chow thought there could be marginal benefits for Singapore.\n\n\"Indirectly, it might be that people pull money out of Thailand, and they want to park some money in Singapore, but that would mostly go to the more defensive blue chips,\" he said.\n\nThe coup, Thailand's 12th since 1932, has ushered in a sense of annoyance but also relief that the political impasse that has kept the country at a standstill for the past six months could finally end.\n\n\"One of my colleagues is there,\" Mr Chow said. \"It's more a feeling of inconvenience rather than fear or violence.\"\n\nIn a note, ANZ wrote: \"The imposition of military coup is certainly not the type of development typically associated with an improving economic outlook. However, in the case of Thailand, it could well prove to be the circuit breaker that allows a return to political normalisation and ultimately allows fiscal policy to become operational again.\"\n\nBut the very factors that have led some to welcome military intervention also make it critical that the army makes the right moves in the months ahead.\n\nAmid the past political fighting, the Thai economy contracted 0.6 per cent year-on-year in the first three months of 2014, with investment and tourism showing significant declines, Moody's Analytics highlighted in a note.\n\n\"Given recent events, we now think the economy will record a second negative quarter in the three months to June, putting it in recession,\" Moody's wrote.\n\nRHB reckoned that private sector confidence will be muted while the military is in power, based on weak private spending during the 2006 coup.\n\nNevertheless, some analysts conveyed optimism that this coup could actually steer Thailand back on the right track.\n\n\"Unlike previous military crackdowns in 2006 and 2010, the current peaceful coup may well create a stable social environment - a key ingredient in supporting market sentiment and ensuring a successful democratic election in Q3 2014,\" OCBC economist Barnabas Gan wrote.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/perfect-performance-fit", "site_title": "Perfect performance fit", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nPerfect performance fit\n\nGolfers can now have their clubs and golf balls customised and pick them up within a day or two. By Justine Moss\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHAVING a set of custom-made golf clubs in one's bag rather than a stock standard one off the shelf has been growing in popularity over the last few years, with a number of golf equipment fitting facilities emerging in Singapore. Yet, more often than not, the reality is that then one has to wait to use them as the clubs have to be ordered from overseas which can take up to six weeks.\n\nWith the opening of the new Callaway Performance Centre (CPC) in Singapore in March, golfers can now have their clubs customised and pick them up within a day or two. Located in Big Fish Golf's (BFG) fitting studio, the CPC is a state-of-the-art facility where Callaway clubs and golf balls, in addition to other brands, can be fitted for every player.\n\nSingapore is the first country in South-east Asia to have a CPC and it was an obvious choice, according to Leighton Richards, managing director, Callaway, South East Asia, Pacific and India. \"Clearly the demand of avid golfers is for custom-made clubs and the service aspect of having to get them from the US is not what you would expect from a premium brand. So for us, it was a no-brainer to support this and BFG's capabilities. BFG has been making custom clubs for tour players for a long time and it seemed like the perfect partnership. We're really excited about it.\"\n\nHe adds: \"It's an exciting time for this region because this is really the first time we've properly entered this space even just by having business model changes and different business models at different times. We're now really committed to this part of the business and it's exciting to have this in Singapore. Singapore is a strategic market for every industry and golf is no exception.\"\n\nBFG is one of the top club-fitting facilities in Singapore, and offers PGA tour level club-fitting facilities outfitted with Trackman Pro, a putter fitting studio, club repair shop and the latest equipment, upgrades and accessories. The addition of this new CPC, which cost at least US$120,000 to install, has now added an extra dimension to their capabilities.\n\n\"There's never been a structure where you come in here and you get fitted in this environment with the best in class,\" explains Eric Ng, managing director, Big Fish Golf, adding: \"It's a one-on-one fitting exercise where you get to test a combination of clubheads versus different shafts and flexes. You complete that experience because you will know which is the best club you can control and the club that you will get the best results. If you like the result but you don't like the feel of the club, we can get something that will be closer to what you feel and what you like but which will deliver the performance you are seeking.\"\n\nIn addition to club-fitting and tweaking, another area which is becoming increasingly popular with golfers is golf ball fitting to suit their game and swing speed. Callaway recently introduced a new range of golf balls - the SR (Speed Regime) 1, 2 and 3 which targets different swing speeds. The four-piece SR1 is suited for those with swing speeds of zero to 90 miles an hour; the SR2 is made for players with speeds of between 90 and 105 miles per hour while the SR3 is targeted at those who swing faster than 105 miles per hour. BFG can put the golfers through their paces matching the ball to the player, in addition to helping them with how it performs on the green, such as spin and performance. \"It's a unique proposition from us, offering all three balls.\" says Mr Ng. \"We put the right ball in the hands of the golfers when they get fitted so they can feel the difference.\"\n\nAnd the launch monitors within the CPC are sensitive enough to pick up quite a distinct difference between all three. \"We are taking the next step of not just fitting for hardware but also the golf ball at the same time,\" explains Mr Richards. \"Technology in the golf clubs themselves - face technology in particular - is giving a lot more ball speed. But then you add golf technology which is perfectly suited for the swing speed at the same time and it's a compounding effect of distance or spin or whatever the golfer is looking for.\"\n\nAnother unique offering that can be found at BFG is a golf club fitting module which Mr Ng has developed and can be used with the Authenticlub platform. Authenticlub is a company headquartered in Singapore which provides authentication services for items using RFID and NFC technology through Authenticlub's Android and Window Phone 8 apps on certain smartphones.\n\nMr Ng's module uses RFID technology to scan the customer's data, preferences and which equipment they are using. This is then inserted behind the golf club grip so after a quick scan of each club the data pops up immediately on a screen. It's a form of warranty for the customer, explains Mr Ng, who will be launching his module publicly next month. Callaway is also keen to roll out the technology in their other performance centres.\n\nHowever, it's not just about Callaway at the CPC. BFG is able to fit all brands for golfers within the centre. \"From a fitting point of view, we're not saying you need to buy a Callaway product to get fitted,\" says Mr Ng. \"When you go to our website, you can see there is a section for general fitting and the other is fitting for Callaway products.\"\n\nAdds Mr Richards: \"We want to give them the best product possible. And that might not be our entire product and as an amateur you should let them play with anything that they think is going to make their game the best. That keeps us striving to put the best product out there. From our side, we are a company that is built on R&D and performance and we have to stand up on our own feet against all the brands.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

RACHEL LOI reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHE may be known for writing self-help books such as Being Happy and Happiness in a Nutshell, but like anybody else, author Andrew Matthews concedes he isn't happy all the time.\n\nHe has his ups and downs, he says, adding that one of his biggest daily challenges is watching his stepson Michael's long-term struggle in the aftermath of a car accident in 1987 which left him with a severe brain injury.\n\n\"He was not expected to live, but he lasted one day, two days, then three days, and now he can walk and speak, so we just have to see it as a blessing,\" says the 56-year-old Australian.\n\n\"Watching him really inspires me because when I get frustrated about something, my wife Julie would often remind me that I wouldn't want to exchange my day for a day in Michael's life. Not one day,\" he adds.\n\nRelevant to Singapore\n\nIt's his conscious decision to keep a positive outlook on life that allows Matthews to keep churning out book after book to share his revelations about happiness.\n\nHis books have so far sold over seven million copies and have been translated into 42 languages.\n\nJust last month, he released his 10th book - How Life Works - complete with some 90 cartoons that he is known to embellish his books with. In it, he looks at the effect of positive psychology, and how it isn't success that makes people happy, but the other way around.\n\n\"The book covers a lot of things that aren't usually covered in what might traditionally be a business book, but with How Life Works, I hope people in businesses are going to ask how to adopt those principles and strategies,\" says Matthews.\n\n\"It's important for people to be happy where they work. If people aren't happy, they keep leaving, and it gets really expensive to replace people and retrain them.\"\n\nThis makes the book very applicable in a society like Singapore's, where success and financial security are highly regarded, he points out.\n\nShifting the goalpost\n\nMatthews explains: \"For most of human history we've had this idea that happiness is somewhere on the other side of success. We say: 'If I could just save $10,000, then I'll be happy'. But the thing is, we keep on shifting the goalpost. We attain the $10,000 then we say: 'I think I'll be happier with $100,000, because that's what someone else has'.\n\n\"So we keep postponing happiness, by saying let me get successful first. But it doesn't work out that way.\"\n\nInstead of just preaching to people about how they should be living their lives, Matthews believes in leading by example, and shares a part of his daily routine that is so simple, even \"a six-year-old could do it\".\n\n\"At the end of the day when I'm lying in bed, I think of three good things that happened to me that day.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be big, it could just be catching up with an old friend or receiving a compliment.\n\n\"What happens is with this habit, I find that now I go looking for good things to write down. And often we find what we are looking out for, so we find even more good things. It's simple and just takes a minute, but it changes how I look at my life,\" Matthews adds.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\n'How Life Works' is available at $22.90 (before GST) at major bookstores\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It agreed to furnish identifying details later for people deemed to be subjects of the probe.\n\nThe agreement will allow attorney general Eric Schneiderman's office to move forward with an investigation of what he describes as illegal hotels, accommodations that violate a state law generally prohibiting spot rentals of entire homes.\n\nPeople who rent out rooms rather than entire dwellings aren't a target of the probe, Mr Schneiderman noted.\n\n\"It buys New York a year to examine Airbnb data and find patterns for egregious law-breaking,\" said Brian Solis, principal analyst at Altimeter Group, a San Mateo, California-based research firm focused on disruptive technology.\n\nAirbnb gets a year \"to use New York as benchmark on how to improve its regulatory compliance, improve service for legitimate renters and better lobby on how to change the law\".\n\nAirbnb, said to be valued at US$10 billion under a financing deal with TPG Capital, has been criticised by affordable housing advocates who say it drives up rents, particularly in cities where living space is scarce and housing costs high.\n\nSupporters of the company's model say it boosts local economies in part by attracting travellers who might not stay at hotels.\n\nAirbnb resisted Mr Schneiderman's investigation, which it called a \"government-sponsored fishing expedition\", and won a ruling from a New York state judge blocking a previously-issued subpoena as overly broad. The attorney general's office subsequently served the company with a revised version.\n\n\"This is a great result,\" Mr Schneiderman said of the agreement. \"I think we've worked out something that's going to be a model or a template for other jurisdictions where this issue has been raised.\"\n\nThe company, founded in 2008, now has listings in about 34,000 cities worldwide and has gained a following as an alternative to hotels.\n\nRobert Habeeb, president of Rosemont, Illinois-based hotel manager First Hospitality Group Inc, said that Airbnb is not \"on a level playing field\" with the hotel industry because its hosts aren't subject to the same regulations and taxes. \"If you're going to rent accommodations to the public, you should be licensed, inspected and taxed,\" he added. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

We will continue to tap the Net Investment Returns Contribution that provides a significant supplement to the annual Budget,\" he said.\n\nThis has been enabled by a framework that has allowed both GIC and Temasek Holdings to pursue investment strategies that generate sustainable portfolio returns for the long term, he noted.\n\nSingapore's economy is in the middle of a transformation, what he described as a \"critical journey\" in building deeper capabilities, bringing about pervasive innovation and uplifting productivity.\n\n\"This is the only way to ensure that Singaporeans have good jobs and to sustain rising incomes.\"\n\nApart from boosting incentives for businesses to adopt proven ICT solutions and pilot emerging technologies, the government will continue to enhance the ease of doing business here by amending the laws to keep regulatory burdens low and streamlining registration and filing processes.\n\nIn a separate addenda issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), a statutory board under the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Tharman said that Singapore's financial markets have remained resilient in the face of global financial volatility.\n\nMr Tharman, the chairman of MAS, noted that the expected tightening of global financial conditions could lead to stresses for financial markets and institutions, shifts in investor sentiment and volatile capital flows. He promised that MAS would stay vigilant and guard against these risks.\n\nSingapore has implemented the Basel III minimum-capital requirements for the local banks two years ahead of the international timeline prescribed.\n\nA risk-based capital framework has been introduced for capital market services licensees, while the capital framework for insurers is being enhanced. MAS is also reviewing the Basel III global liquidity rules for local implementation.\n\n\"We will build on our earlier efforts to fortify the resilience of financial institutions in Singapore and ensure the proper functioning of our capital markets and financial market infrastructures,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe also reiterated Singapore's commitment to international efforts to combat money laundering and tax evasion; measures are in place to ensure the country remains a \"clean and trusted\" financial centre.\n\n\"Laundering proceeds from tax evasion and tax fraud is now a crime in Singapore. MAS has stepped up to meet enhanced global standards on information exchange and has intensified its supervision of financial institutions to keep illicit money out of our financial centre,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The SS is the lightest Tokyobike model available here, and customers may make it their own by fixing add-ons. Customisable options include vintage headlamps, bicycle panniers and saddle bags. The Tokyobike 2014 Limited Edition SS is available in three classic colours: dark green, ivory and black.\n\nRunwell\n\nShinola, Robinsons Orchard\n\nPrice: $4,700\n\nTHE Runwell prides itself in being an urban and practical bike, inspired by the French \"porteur bikes\" used by newspaper couriers. It has a front rack, making it useful for running errands and is virtually maintenance free due to the use of a high-end Shimano Alfine 11-speed internal gear. The Runwell is available in sunshine yellow, emerald green and London red.\n\nThe Coastliner\n\nCoast Cycles, 54 Siglap Drive\n\nPrice: $2,800\n\nTHE Coastliner is a fuss-free, simple and stylish bike. Jansen Tan, owner of Coast Cycles, developed his own process of making the bike frame for The Coastliner so that all unsightly cables and wires are hidden from view. The use of a belt-driven transmission instead of the traditional drivetrain system keeps the bike clean, preventing grease stains on its rider's legs. The Coastliner is available in four colours: matte white, satin chrome, grey and pearl white.\n\nCompiled by Chew Hui-Yan\n\nhychew@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue rose 4.5 per cent to $278.8 million for the year ended March 31. The hotel segment saw a 6 per cent rise in operating profit due to better cost management. Operating profit was down 4 per cent for the group's property investment, while for property development, it slid 15 per cent. Earnings per share stood at 3.14 cents, down from 3.67 cents a year ago. Stamford Land declared a final dividend of two cents per share and a one-cent special dividend for FY2014, the same as the previous year.\n\nSurface Mount Q4 profit plunges 99%\n\nSURFACE Mount Technology (Holdings), which has been under SGX's watch list since mid-2011, saw net profit fall 99 per cent to HK$1.54 million (S$248,667) for the final quarter ended March 2014 from HK$168 million a year ago. Noteworthy is that in the fourth quarter FY2013, the company booked a restructuring gain of HK$159 million from currency translation into the income statement. If it were to be excluded, quarterly operating profit a year ago would have been HK$9.3 million. Revenue was marginally lower at HK$144 million from HK$144.9 million. For the full year, net profit was down 98 per cent at HK$6.6 million. on the back of a 12 per cent rise in revenue to HK$697 million. Earnings per share for the quarter remained unchanged from a year ago at 0.83 Hong Kong cents. No dividend was declared.\n\nTung Lok issues profit warning for FY2014\n\nTUNG Lok Restaurants warned that it is likely to make a loss in financial year 2014 due to rising costs and lower revenue from outlets. It issued the profit guidance on the back of rising operating costs in relation to food, manpower and rental. Tung Lok also said that revenue from outlets opened during the current and previous financial years are expected to be lower as they are still within the gestation period and require more time to build up a sustainable revenue base.\n\nGolden Ocean mulling over delisting on SGX\n\nGOLDEN Ocean Group made net profit of $10.3 million for the first quarter ended March 2014, up 51 per cent from $6.8 million a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 2.3 cents from 1.5 cents per share a year ago. The company declared a dividend of 2.5 cents per share. The dry bulk shipper also said that it is mulling to delist its shares from the secondary listing on SGX given the thin trading volume.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong gets a preview of what's stirring The red-hot restaurant scene in Singapore is luring F&B heavyweights\n\nPublished Fri, May 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOne Big House Party\n\nPotato Head Folk\n\n31 Keong Saik Road\n\nOpens June\n\nIF you don't have time to slip away to Bali's fashionable beaches, here's a little time-saving tip: Bali's most fashionable beach club brand will soon come to you.\n\nDebuting next month - in the heart of Singapore's increasingly fashionable Keong Saik neighbourhood, no less - is Potato Head Folk, the first international outpost for the Potato Head Group (PTT).\n\nStarted as a bistro and bar in the Indonesian capital in 2009, the Jakarta-based group is best known for its Potato Head Beach Club on Bali's Seminyak beach, an architecturally stunning venue with a perpetual weekend vibe, beach-appropriate tipple, and a solid food menu.\n\n\"Opening in Singapore has been on the top of our list for a long time,\" says PTT's cocktail and concept consultant, Dre Masso. \"As our first international venue, we wanted to do it in an important place. People outside the region may not have heard of Potato Head so Singapore, as a globally recognised culinary destination with phenomenal bars and hotels, will provide a great platform for us.\"\n\nPTT's Indonesian founders Ronald Akili and Jason Gunawan were so taken by Keong Saik's village feel when they visited last year, he says, that a deal was swiftly inked between them and a few local investors. Potato Head Folk takes over the iconic four-storey art deco building previously occupied by popular coffeeshop, Tong Ah Eating House, which moved to a new unit down the road last July.\n\nBesides its eponymous brands, the group also runs tapas bar Lilin and French restaurant Tapping Shoes on its Bali premises. It additionally launched casual burger joint The Three Buns in Jakarta last month - a concept they will be transplating here. The latter takes its name from the three options you have for burger buns - the classic white bun, a demi-brioche and a wholemeal bun - and will occupy the first two floors.\n\nIn keeping with the joint's \"slow fast food\" ethos, ingredients will be sourced locally and everything \"from the patties to the ketchup and pickles,\" will be made in-house as far as possible, says group consulting chef Adam Penney. And it's not just marketing spiel: you can peer in to check on the open kitchen on the ground floor from its counter-side stools or the outdoor high tables that seat 35. One level up, a slightly more spiffed up space called the Three Buns Restaurant will offer the same burger menu, but with table service in a whimsical Alice In Wonderland-esque space for 40, including a large communal table for 14.\n\nLike its bold, quirky interiors put together by Australian artist David Bromley, expect each burger at The Three Buns to have distinctive personalities - along with cheeky names such as the Burning Man chilli cheese burger with a spicy Korean gochujang and jalapeno dressing; the Rambo, or Middle Eastern-inspired lamb burger packed with aubergine and feta cheese; the vegetarian The Roots burger with butternut squash, roasted beetroot and courgette fritters; and the double cheese and double onion-stacked the Four Floors, a homage to our own Orchard Towers. Pair them off with sides such as the \"LL Coolslaw\" coleslaw or \"naughty fries\" accompanied by a gochujang-bearnaise dip and topped with beef chilli.\n\nFor dessert, spoon into ceramic ramekin-encased puddings supplied by Mr Penney's UK-based dessert company, Pots & Co, alongside homemade cookies in flavours like classic chocolate chip or white chocolate and raspberry, to luxe combos such as truffle walnut, chocolate and porcini, brie and bakkwa, and stilton with rum and raisin. True to their namesake commitment to building a community of like-minded folk, the dining room will double as an art space for performances and exhibitions to showcase creative talents from Singapore and beyond.\n\nOn the third floor sits drinks-centric lounge Studio 1939 - a nod to the building's founding year. Chinese antique furniture contrasts against Bromley's modern art sculptures and a luxurious marble bar - all styled to make one feel like you were dining in the study of a friend's home.\n\nThe winelist, aptly, is padded with carefully curated picks of special vintages, limited collections and private reserves, along with a mix of classic and creative cocktails crafted by Mr Masso and his team. The bar bites menu takes inspiration from \"food around the world that we love\", he adds, such as a platter of Iberico ham and award-winning British cheeses, or a plate of grass-fed venison carpaccio with Muscat raisins. Or, head for premium picks such as truffle fries with fresh truffles shaven over them, smoked chips with foie gras dip, and the burger to trump them all: topped with caviar, sea urchin mayonnaise, oyster leaf and wasabi. Though you have to push past a heavy closed door to enter the reservations-only space, \"we're not a members bar, but a space for people who truly care about quality,\" Mr Masso clarifies.\n\nCapping them off is the The Rooftop, a lush tropical garden - the only open-air rooftop to overlook the street - inspired by the Tiki culture of the 1930s. Expect slushie-style blended drinks, bottled cocktails made with fresh juices daily, and \"jerk cocktails\", or carbonated libations created by mixing alcohol and sodas, that you knock back from coconut and bamboo cups made by Balinese craftsmen. Besides the staple menu of barbecued and smoked meats, the rooftop space will periodically host exclusive 'Folk Gatherings', or regular dinners under the stars that will feature local and global guest chefs along with unusual performances.\n\nMusic programming will be a pivotal part of Potato Head Folk, says Mr Masso, and its playlist will revolve around a mix of soul, funk and hip hop beats on the first two floors, and folk and blues on the third and top floors. \"The idea is that it would be like a giant house party - you're even welcome to hang out along the stairs,\" he adds.\n\nBesides the Singapore expansion, the group is also planning to launch a new concept in Jakarta later this year and a 60-room boutique hotel right next to its Bali beach club in partnership with Sydney's Movida restaurant next year. Another beach club on Bali's Canggu Beach and a second Seminyak hotel designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas will follow in 2016.\n\nSpicing up the club scene\n\nNutmeg & Clove\n\n17 Ann Siang Road\n\n6pm till late, Tue-Sat\n\nkae@nutmegandclove.com.sg\n\nOpens mid-June\n\nTHEY'VE bagged global awards for their theatrical libations, elaborate garnishes and luxe interiors steeped in old-world glamour. Now, the personalities behind legendary London cocktail bar Nightjar want to shake things up, Singapore-style.\n\nSoon to join the line-up of craft cocktail bars such as Manor, Oxwell & Co and Ding Dong on Ann Siang Road is Nutmeg & Clove, a collaborative venture between several silent partners in the alcohol trade and Nightjar's head barman Marian Beke. The 31-year-old Slovak has helmed the speakeasy in London's uber-hip Hoxton neighbourhood since its 2011 founding. He says of the impetus to start the Singapore venue: \"We realised that there were many world-class bars in Singapore, but not many celebrating its traditions and rich, colourful culture. When a unit opened up at Ann Siang Hill, we jumped at the chance as the Chinatown area offers great stories about the roots and journey of Singapore.\"\n\nThe bar's name, for instance, is an open tribute to Ann Siang Hill, which was previously home to Singapore's oldest nutmeg and clove plantations. Fittingly, the bar will also feature a range of herbs, spices and fruit that reflect the diversity of the local palate. Like at Nightjar, where the drinks menu is sectioned by historical eras such pre-Prohibition, Prohibition and Post-war, including a premium category of vintage spirits dating back to the early 1900s, drinks at Nutmeg & Clove draw inspiration from different periods of time that most significantly shaped cocktail culture. Signature pours are still being measured out, but cocktails will range from $16 to $20.\n\nMr Beke, however, is cautious to downplay comparisons between the two bars: \"We are not trying to open a version of Nightjar in Singapore as each city has its differences. What works in London might not necessarily work in Singapore. We are trying instead to set up a place for locals, using ingredients that best suit the Asian palate... but with the same attention to detail and high standard of cocktails synonymous with the Nightjar brand.\"\n\nWhile Mr Beke shuttles between London and Singapore to consult on the menu, the bar will be presided over by head mixologist Yin Te-Kai - better known as Kae Yin - previously the head bartender at whisky and jazz bar Marsalis Home in his native Taipei. A soon-to-be-announced local head chef who has clocked in time at top restaurants in Singapore will plate up Western bar fare with subtle Singaporean and Southeast Asian influences ($9 to $22).\n\nIn a further nod to the 1,200 sq ft, 45-seater shophouse unit's former life as the lobby area of the Ching Yoon Wooi Kwoon, one of Singapore's oldest Cantonese clan associations, the bar's sultry den-esque interiors is accented by dark wood kopitiam chairs, Chinese lattice panels and a gunny sack-covered feature wall. Drawers and cabinets reminscent of Chinese medical halls serve an aesthetic and practical purpose: they are where alcohol bottles and bar tools are stored.\n\nThough the concept for the cocktail bar has been gestating \"for years\" while the team tried to align their schedule and resources, says Mr Beke, the current boom in Singapore's cocktail scene spurred them to get the project off the ground. \"In the past five years, I've witnessed an explosion of cocktail bars of high standard all over the city, not just by locals but from old hands in the industry and big brands all around the world. International bartenders have also been relocating from cocktail trend-leading cities such as Sydney, New York and San Francisco - so this must be a good thing,\" elaborates Mr Beke, adding that he first visited Singapore nine years ago and \"instantly fell in love with it\".\n\n\"Singapore is the London of Asia for me: it's a favoured travel destination and a metropolitan city with open-minded and multicultural residents. Our first venue will set the benchmark in the eyes of future investors and the public, and Singapore offers good soil to start growing any type of business,\" he says. \"And it has better weather than London too!\"\n\nArt gallery-cum-nightclub\n\nCanvas\n\nB1-01/06 The Riverwalk, 20 Upper Circular Road\n\nOpens mid-July\n\nTHEY came, dipped a cautious toe in to test the waters, and now they've decided to plunge right in.\n\nAfter a brief pop-up stint during last year's Formula One weekend, the people behind iconic Bangkok nightspot Bed Supperclub will have their highly anticipated resurfacing in Singapore this July. And this time, it's here to stay. To be named Canvas, the art gallery by day and club by night is a collaborative venture between Bed Concepts and indie music venue, Home Club, which shuttered earlier this month.\n\n\"We've been looking at doing something in Singapore for a long time,\" says Mahen Nathan, one of Bed Concepts' four partners and the only Singaporean. Besides owning and running Bed Supperclub, the group also invests in lifestyle businesses and consults for restaurant and nightlife projects around the Indochina region. Bed Supperclub went on a hiatus last September when its lease on the boisterous Soi 11 party strip ran out after 12 years. As it turns out, Home Club's co-owner Roy Ng and a long-time friend of Mr Nathan, was simultaneously looking for a new concept to refresh his decade-old venue known for its alternative music programming and its anything-goes, hipster community centre vibe. \"Besides the genesis of our respective clubs, our programming and philosophy of Home Club and Bedsupper Club are pretty similar,\" says Mr Nathan of the natural partnership. \"Home Club didn't close, it's just an evolution of what it used to be\".\n\nThe art gallery-cum-nightclub was a concept that had been gestating on the drawing board for some time, says Mr Mahen, and the initial plan was to launch the first Canvas in Bangkok, but their vision shifted southwards to Singapore given the country's current political turmoil. Talks for further outlets in Taiwan and Hong Kong are also under way. At Canvas, Bed Concepts will set the direction for its concept and content, while the Home Club team will front its operations. \"Roy and his team have already built a strong community in Singapore, they're respected as a serious player in the scene, and their longevity is testament to their credibility.\"\n\nThe Singapore venue will be a 3,000 sq ft multi-purpose space for 600 that is inspired by Andy Warhol's 1960s creative playground, The Factory. By day, the space will function as an art gallery for multiple artists across different genres - from photographers, to installation artists, painters and sculptors - to showcase their work. By night, local and international DJs and musicians take to the roost, and digitised artworks and installation artworks take on different mood lighting to help transform the scene.\n\nA large part of the million-dollar venue's transformation from day to night use will rely on technology, Mr Mahen reveals. For instance, a 3D-mapping feature wall running the length of space will showcase digital artworks when the gallery opens from 2pm in the afternoon and gradually transition to become a digital backdrop when club operations kick in after dark. The gallery's river-front facade, meanwhile, comprises a rotating panel on which interactive digital projections - something that featured in Bed Supperclub - will be cast. On weekends, the same wall doubles as a screen for regular film screenings. \"We want to blur the lines between genres that are traditionally considered niche or underground and the commercial,\" says Mr Nathan. Photo and film exhibits will be rotated every fortnight while more labour-intensive installations will be changed monthly. Local artists such as photographer Russel Wong, Alvin Tan of design collective Phunk Studio, and filmmaker Mikael Teo will kick off the initial roster.\n\n\"Unlike the old Home Club, where you could just grab a guitar and jump on stage spontaneously, we want to have a bit more deliberate programming here, with a lot of thought that goes into it\" - all with the aim of appealing to a wider market segment, says Mr Nathan. Home Club regulars will still find something to return to, however, as weekly events such as Comedy Nights on Tuesdays and local comedian Kumar's fortnightly stand-ups on Thursdays will remain. Sparingly fitted out to allow each incoming artist to fashion it as they prefer, the entire space can also be booked for private events such as art festivals and after-parties or corporate product launches.\n\nOn why he chose to craft a new concept rather than replicate Bed Supperclub here, Mr Mahen says: \"Singapore is a small market - running a megaclub will have its challenges. At the same time, we saw a movement towards a greater appreciation of arts and culture in Asia,\" he says. To add further oomph to their programming, a five-man \"advisory council\" comprising The National Art Gallery's Woon Tai Ho and local artists such as Alvin Tan and filmmaker Mikael Teo will work with Canvas's creative team to tap their collective network across the region and globally.\n\nWhen Canvas establishes further outlets overseas, artists and creative content from its various venues can then cross-pollinate, says Mr Nathan.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We are at the right place at the right time,\" said Yoma's chief executive officer, Andrew Rickards, in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nBut there are payoffs in setting the stage for higher growth - more expenses. Significant new hires to plug the human capital gap cranked up staff cost over the fiscal fourth quarter to $5.7 million from $2.3 million a year ago. This was the main cause of a 61.7 per cent surge in administrative expenses to $9.6 million.\n\n\"We think this is the golden time to be hiring in the golden land and we should be hiring now instead of waiting. Management class is missing (in Myanmar,) so we have to hire from outside - both expatriates and returning Burmese - and our cost base has gone up,\" said Mr Rickards.\n\nThat being the case, a strong top-line growth may not be matched by profit growth which for now, he said, could be muted over the firm's investment phase.\n\nThe niggling uncertainty involving Yoma's acquisition of the Landmark Development site, which analysts are fixated on given its catalytic impact on earnings, still persists even as the long-stop date for the deal looms closer by end-June.\n\nYoma's acquisition of the 10-acre land in downtown Yangon has been delayed as talks are still ongoing for a lease extension from the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC).\n\n\"We have received verbal approval so far from MIC and now waiting on the Ministry of Railways to agree to the lease,\" said Mr Rickards, adding that the firm is in the half-way mark of getting there.\n\n\"It will happen but in terms of timing, one can't hurry that,\" he added.\n\nAlso, two months ago, the firm unveiled big moves into new sectors, namely education, agriculture and cold storage and logistics, in its bid to turn into a conglomerate.\n\nIn February last year, it started its move into the auto after-sales service business by tying up with Japan's Mitsubishi. It also has a pact with Mitsubishi to import, supply and instal elevators.\n\nEventually, the hope is that in five years, Yoma's income stream will be led equally by real estate, its current mainstay and non-real estate business.\n\n\"We know roughly where we are going (with the diversification plan). We are pretty clear where some pebbles are - agriculture, auto, logistics and travel and tourism,\" he said, referring to these sectors as potential big businesses for Yoma.\n\n\"Some other pebbles we have put on the beach, but we're not sure which of them could be winners in the long term,\" he said.\n\nYoma shares closed trading yesterday at 70 cents, up two cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Back then, certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums had dropped off, following the introduction of car loan curbs.\n\nIndeed, the jump in April's consumer price index (CPI) was largely due to a rise in car prices; private road transport costs climbed 5.7 per cent in April, reversing four consecutive months of decline. The increase reflected the rise in COE premiums - exacerbated by the low base in April 2013 - and an edging up of petrol pump prices.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The issuance represents 73 per cent of the group's enlarged share capital.\n\nTo counter the dilutive effects of the enlarged share base, Manhattan will offer a one-for-one bonus issue of 1.88 billion warrants to its existing shareholders and vendors at an exercise price of $1 per share. This is conditional on the completion of the acquisition.\n\nBesides rewarding shareholders, the warrant issue will raise funds for the group in future, said Manhattan's CEO and managing director, David Low.\n\nShares in Manhattan tumbled by as much as 15.5 per cent to 65.5 cents yesterday, before ending at 72 cents - still a 5.5 cent, or 7.1 per cent, drop from its pre-trading halt price and making it among the market's top losers.\n\nThe new shares are to be issued to Indonesian mining tycoon Low Tuck Kwong, who controls Manhattan with a 53.85 per cent stake; Kaiyi Investment, owned by Dr Low and his immediate family as well as those of his son Low Yi Ngo and his daughter Elaine Low; Mining Alliances; and Asiaworld Capital.\n\nBecause the proposed acquisition is so substantial and involves an \"interested person\" - Dr Low - it will be subject to Manhattan shareholders' approval.\n\nSingxin Resources, after a restructuring exercise, will hold 70 per cent of GiantMiner, which in turn owns Urumqi Jinshi Huilong Mining Co, which has permits to explore three mines in Xinjiang, China.\n\nThis is not the first time Manhattan has shown interest in Xinjiang mining assets. Last month, it announced a call option to acquire up to 60 per cent of Starsmind Capital, a holding company which has an option for a stake of up to 39.4 per cent in Mineriver which holds a metals exploration permit in Xinjiang.\n\nThe board of Manhattan Resources said the acquisition will allow it to embark on a business in China's potentially lucrative mineral mining industry with good potential for growth.\n\n\"The company has been looking at various investment prospects to create a stable revenue base for the company. Where there are current collaborations being explored in respect of the barging business, it is not expected to pick up dramatically. Hence, it is the intention of the company to diversify into mining,\" it said.\n\nManhattan is primarily engaged in shipping and logistics for the coal and resources industries in Indonesia. In its latest concluded first quarter, its turnover fell 29 per cent to $4.7 million, due to lower coal transportation volume as well as higher compliance and charter expenses.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

UK purchases climbed 27 per cent to 3.37 billion euros.\n\n\"The underlying attraction is the stability of Germany; it's a low-volatility, safe market,\" Mr Hutchings said. \"There's a view that growth from good-quality retail will start to accelerate in the coming years.\" Insurers, pension funds and money managers are buying German commercial properties as a way to boost returns amid record-low interest rates in fixed-income markets. Retail asset prices are under pressure to rise as supply fails to keep up, New York-based Cushman & Wakefield said in the report.\n\nGermany, which usually competes closely with the UK for Europe's top retail investment destination, edged ahead in the first quarter because of two large deals, Mr Hutchings said.\n\nThe biggest was Unibail-Rodamco SE's investment of as much as 535 million euros for a stake in the CentrO shopping centre in Oberhausen, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The index climbed a hefty 3.4 points to 52.7, a level not seen in nearly 3-1/2 years.\n\nQu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC, said: \"The improvement was broad-based with both new orders and new export orders back in expansionary territory. Disinflationary pressures also eased over the month and output prices increased for the first time since November 2013.\n\n\"Some tentative signs of stabilisation are emerging, partly as a result of the recent mini-stimulus measures and lower borrowing costs. But downside risks to growth remain, particularly as the property market continues to cool. We think more policy easing is needed to put a floor under growth in the coming months.\"\n\nHe also noted that the employment index fell further to 47.3, which implies that this month's uptick in sentiment has not yet filtered through to the labour market.\n\nOf the 11 sub-indices in the survey, all but those for employment and stocks of finished goods rose compared to April.\n\nIn the case of employment, the index fell over a point to stand well under 50, the 13th consecutive month that jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector.\n\nAny marked weakening in the labour market would raise alarm bells for China's government, which regards healthy employment levels as a top policy priority and an important condition for social stability.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said in March that it is all right if economic growth comes in slightly below the government's 7.5 per cent target, as long as the job market holds up.\n\nHit by unsteady global demand, slowing domestic investment growth and a cooling property market, China's economic growth fell to an 18-month low in the first three months of this year.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters believe growth in the world's second-largest economy will dip to a 24-year low of 7.3 per cent this year - just ahead of the 7.2 per cent expansion that Mr Li has said is necessary for a robust labour market.\n\nJapanese manufacturing activity also contracted in May but at a slower pace than the previous month, a similar preliminary survey showed, in a sign of tentative recovery after a sales tax hike in April led to a slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nThe Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 49.9 in May from a final reading of 49.4 in April.\n\nUnlike China, however, the index for new export orders fell to a preliminary 48.2 from a final reading of 49.1 in April.\n\nExports have been a soft spot for the recovering economy and policymakers have been counting on a rebound in shipments to offset the expected drop in consumer consumption in the immediate months after the sales tax increase.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that any damage from the tax hike will be limited. A Reuters survey showed companies expect sales to bounce back and are more willing to raise wages. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

In a matter of five months, the firm shifted its focus from investing in a Chinese mining firm to banking on an African forestry firm.\n\nThere is a thick sense of urgency in the air after auditor BDO raised doubts over the firm's ability to soldier on as a viable concern.\n\nJES bled more red ink in 2013; it posted losses of 552.2 million yuan (S$112 million), substantially higher than the 112.3 million yuan figure a year previously. But now, news of the contract win may add some glimmer of hope for the struggling firm.\n\nThis new contract follows two months after the firm clinched a job to build four Newcastlemax bulk carriers and two post-Panamax bulk carriers, plus options to construct seven such carriers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Premium travel within Europe contracted 1.6 per cent, though Iata added that indicators of business activity and economic growth suggest Q2 2014 will be stronger than Q1.\n\n\"Improvements in advanced economies should sustain growth in premium travel ahead, but downward pressure from weakness in some emerging markets is likely,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He declined to say how many.\n\nUnder labour rules, employees need to show support from 50 per cent of their ranks, plus one, to file for an election. \"We have an overwhelming majority,\" Mr McDaniel said. \"It's not at 50 per cent; it's way over that. We've got well more than we need.\" The flight attendants filed on Tuesday with the National Mediation Board, which could set an election for as early as two months from now, after allowing Virgin an opportunity to protest and authenticating the cards submitted by the workers. The airline was founded in 2004 by British entrepreneur Richard Branson, began flying in 2007 and is majority owned by VAI Partners, with a minority stake owned by Virgin Group.\n\nIt has about 2,700 employees and significant operations in Los Angeles and at Dallas Love Field, where it recently won two gates. Virgin America flies a fleet of Airbus A320 jets.\n\nIn December 2011, Virgin America flight attendants rejected a bid to organise.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/not-sunset-singapores-oil-refineries", "site_title": "Not sunset for Singapore's oil refineries", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNot sunset for Singapore's oil refineries\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCLEARLY, no oil refinery today is too big to fail. Just a while ago, the Australians were lamenting the closure of their refineries by the super majors like Shell, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron - pointing, as the reason, to the bigger and more competitive Asian refineries like those in Singapore and South Korea.\n\nBut Shell recently also took the unprecedented step of writing off (even if only in the accounting sense) its 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) Bukom refinery - which, capacity-wise, is the largest in its global refining system. As even more competitive facilities emerge (like the shale gas-fuelled US refineries and new giant Middle East complexes), global refining margins have melted.\n\nAmid this outlook, even the most ardent proponents like local oil trader Hin Leong know well enough to back off on its ambitions for a new greenfield refinery here. In China, powerhouses Sinopec and PetroChina have also scaled back billions of dollars in new refinery investments.\n\nStill, while things look pretty bleak, Singapore's oil refining industry has always weathered the storms. While there have been some plant mothballings here in the past, including at Bukom, affected plants were put back into operation when business improved. To date, there has been only one Singapore refinery closure: this was back in 1995 when BP Singapore shut its small 28,000 bpd Pasir Panjang facility, but only because of land use issues.\n\nA big plus today is that the three Singapore refineries - owned by industry leaders ExxonMobil (EM), Shell, Chevron and PetroChina - are continuing to upgrade and build resilience in their operations. Chevron and PetroChina have just committed to new gasoline and cogeneration investments for their Singapore Refining Company (SRC) joint venture, which is crucially their only facility serving the growing South-east Asian market.\n\nOn their part, EM and Shell - which have planted their largest global manufacturing facilities here - have integrated their oil refineries with their petrochemical crackers, thus further enhancing the competitiveness and value-add of their operations here. EM's latest cracker can even produce petrochemicals directly from crude oil feedstock: a world's first, which makes it super-competitive, apart from being energy-saving and more environment-friendly. This connectivity is also recognised by Shell, which has stressed that the Bukom refinery is tied to its profitable chemicals asset here and that, therefore, there is value in the overall chain.\n\nAlso attractive for the industry is Singapore's strategic location and competitive advantages like its efficient logistics. In addition to further enhancing Jurong Island, Singapore is also working with the refiners to build up three value-add legs: namely fuels, chemicals, and lubricants. The Republic is clearly not about to declare refining a sunset industry any time soon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under the new system, the government will own the buses as well as bus infrastructure such as depots, while contracting bus routes out in 12 packages via a tender process to both local and foreign players. Operators will be paid a fee to run and maintain the services, while the government will retain all fare revenue.\n\nThe restructuring is largely aimed at raising service standards by increasing competition and creating a more flexible system where the government can make tweaks more swiftly and nimbly in response to changes in ridership and commuter needs.\n\nHigher service standards will be built into the contract as operators will be expected to run bus services at shorter intervals during peak hours, with at least half of all bus services to operate at intervals of no more than 10 minutes. Such improvements, if pulled off, would be substantial enough for commuters to feel the difference, said industry observers.\n\n\"The quality of the public transport service (would) now (be) determined by . . . how much money (the government) is willing to spend on improving service standards, rather than profitability concerns for private operators,\" said the head of SIM University's urban transport management programme, Park Byung Joon.\n\nAt the same time, Dr Park warned that the pursuit of enhanced service standards could potentially end up proving costly for taxpayers. \"Public transport with a high service standard does not come cheap. It is very unlikely that the whole expense will be passed onto commuters in the form of fares,\" highlighted Dr Park, adding that Seoul's government has faced a steady increase in operating subsidy payments to bus operators since 2003.\n\nIn a Facebook post yesterday, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said: \"Any changes to a system that we've been running for many years means that there will be adjustments needed at various levels and possibly some transitional issues. We will pay careful attention during implementation to minimize inconvenience to commuters.\"\n\nForeign firms such as France's Keolis, Australia's Tower Transit and Britain's Go Ahead have been mooted as possible entrants into the market. Woodlands Transport Service, which has one of the largest private transport fleets in Singapore, said that it would be keen to look into the tender and study the details.\n\nMeanwhile, the incumbent operators will have to work even harder if they want to remain in the business and maintain their scale, Lee Der-Horng, deputy head (research) at NUS' Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, pointed out. But income streams for the two transport operators would also be more predictable with the new model in place.\n\nSBST described yesterday's development as a \"more sustainable option for the future\", although it acknowledged it would have a \"major impact\" on the way it operated. \"We are, however, prepared and will be able to tap on the experience of our sister companies in London and Sydney which operate in a similar tender regime,\" SBST added. Meanwhile, SMRT said that it is geared up to participate in the tendering exercise, and will continue to prioritise service excellence and operational performance in its existing bus operations.\n\nAnalysts expect an asset-light SBST and SMRT, with depreciation off their balance sheets, to be strongly positioned even with the introduction of competition. NUS' Prof Lee does not rule out a joint venture between a local and overseas player either.\n\nTo start, three packages - or 20 per cent of the existing bus routes - will be offered up for tender starting from H2 2014, with the new operators to start handling the routes from H2 2016. The contract for each package will last five years, with a possible two-year extension based on performance.\n\nOver the last two years, LTA has studied other markets, such as London and Australia, where similar models have been implemented successfully.\n\nWhen their bus service operating licences expire on Aug 31, 2016, SMRT and SBST will initially continue to operate the remaining nine packages under the contracting model to minimise disruptions to service. Progressively, these too will be offered up for tender. After 2022, all packages will be tendered out, with the aim of having at least three to five bus operators in the market.\n\nDetails of the first bus package will be released next week.\n\nTo safeguard the interests of staff employed by existing bus operators, the government will require new operators to make job offers to all workers servicing the tendered bus routes at similar terms and conditions to their current contract. This will be overseen by the Public Transport Tripartite Committee which comprises LTA, the Ministry of Manpower and the National Transport Workers Union.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Additionally, the provision of high ceilings enables companies to retrofit the units to new usage such as cleanrooms and laboratories. Features like high floor loading and wide corridors also mean that some of the traditionally land-based industries can now go high-rise.\n\nThe nine-storey development features five land-based units which span 1,200 to 1,900 sq m and 105 high-rise units which range from 160 to 260 sq m.\n\nRolling out developments with such high technical specifications is targeted specifically at industrialists engaged in heavier manufacturing; this segment has been insufficiently supported by private developers as such high specification factories cost more to build.\n\n\"JTC no longer builds 'plain vanilla' flatted factories as this segment is well served by private developers. We are now building our next generation industrial facilities with productivity-enabling features to meet the needs of industrialists,\" said Loo Choon Yong, chairman of JTC.\n\nAdditionally, the facility will feature flexible and adaptable design to cater to the needs of different sizes of companies, in particular SMEs. Companies can opt for horizontal expansion by combining multiple units on the same floor to form larger contiguous manufacturing spaces; or for vertical expansion facilitated by the provision of knock-out floor slabs which allow industrialists to install their preferred material handling system.\n\n\"JTC Space @ Tampines North ... has been thoughtfully designed for SMEs involved in the heavier manufacturing activities,\" said Lawrence Leow, honorary treasurer of Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and chairman of the SBF-led SME Committee (SMEC).\n\n\"We appreciate JTC's swift response to fill such a market gap and are confident that more of such innovative developments will help our SMEs grow and improve their productivity,\" said Mr Leow.\n\nAmong other firsts, the development will mark a milestone in JTC's achievement in land optimisation, with a proposed high plot ratio of 3.0, the highest to date for an industrial facility. JTC added that it hopes to set new standards for other industrial developers - during construction, JTC will be utilising dry walls for non-load bearing walls to reduce labour requirements and increase productivity. It has also leveraged passive design to maximise natural ventilation and lighting, thus contributing to energy savings.\n\nConstruction for JTC Space @ Tampines North will begin by the end of the year and is targeted to be completed by 2016.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/tentative-truce-thailand", "site_title": "A tentative truce in Thailand", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA tentative truce in Thailand\n\nPublished\n\nWed, May 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nEVEN if it sounds like a coup and looks like a coup, it is not really a coup. Or at least that's what the Thai military would like the world to believe.\n\nThere may be reason to buy their argument, at least for now. For starters, the military, which enforced martial law in Thailand on Tuesday morning, has thus far not replaced the government, allowing it to continue to exist and function. Nor has the military taken sides with any specific party or faction: neither the anti-government protesters nor the pro-establishment supporters.\n\nBut the real motive behind the unexpected imposition of martial law - even the government was apparently kept in the dark - will unravel in the coming days as the military takes its next steps.\n\nWhatever it is, one thing seems clear: a government controlled remotely by fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra is not likely to be tenable. This has been a key point of disagreement between the two political factions. The opposition has said that Thaksin engineered the country's recent elections to keep his sister Yingluck in the prime minister post. Since a Thai court ruling ousted her from her position earlier this month, anti-government protesters have called for an appointed government as they say the country's democracy has been corrupted by the Shinawatra family. Acting Prime Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongphaisan has instead asked for new elections to be called in August.\n\nIf a compromise is to be reached, and the country's political unrest since last November is to end, then the new government must show that it has a clean break from the Shinawatra family. But the more pertinent point is that for a compromise to be reached in the first place, both sides must be brought to the negotiating table and show a willingness to reach middle ground.\n\nThis is what the military must next do. Through its intervention, it has taken a decisive step to calm tensions that have already claimed 28 lives. It must now bring both sides to agree on some kind of roadmap to a return to a legitimate civilian government.\n\nThis is easier said than done. Thai army chief General Prayuth Chan-Ocha met with representatives of both factions yesterday, and the talks ended without a conclusion. They are to resume today. The outcome remains to be seen, but the process is encouraging: it shows that the military is sincere in trying to broker some kind of political resolution.\n\nAmid all this, the country's revered monarch sits on the sidelines watching the drama unfold. But maybe not for long. Since both political factions are likely to heed the word of the Thai King, it seems plausible that a royal decree to establish an interim council could be the trump card that the Thai military may use to break the political deadlock.\n\nBut that, too, can only be an interim measure. Eventually, Thais will surely still demand a legitimate, democratically elected government. This must remain the ultimate goal.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It came on the heels of a maiden SGD issue by Far East Horizon Ltd, which attracted $3.8 billion in orders for its $400 million three-and- a-half-year 4.25 per cent bonds.\n\nLast week, Central China Real Estate (CCRE) sold $200 million three-year bonds at 6.5 per cent and received orders of $1 billion.\n\nPrivate bank investors made up 79 per cent of the buyers for CCRE's bonds. As for Yanlord, the allocation to private banks was 77 per cent, and it was 52 per cent for the Far East Horizon deal.\n\nThe bonds are sold at $250,000 a pop.\n\nSaid Todd Schubert, Bank of Singapore head of fixed income research: \"Among emerging markets globally, China has seen by far the greatest increase in issuance year-over-year.\"\n\nIssuance has been robust in both the traditional USD eurobond markets as well as local currency markets such as SGD, he said.\n\n\"The SGD is attractive as it enables issuers to diversify their funding sources and investor bases. Since Chinese names have been issuing in SGD for several years now, they have developed name recognition among local investors,\" said Mr Schubert.\n\n\"They're not only making a beeline to Singapore, Chinese issuers are the most frequent issuers in Asia. They're very, very active,\" said Clifford Lee, DBS head of fixed income.\n\nYear to date, DBS has done 24 bond issues for Chinese companies denominated in USD, RMB, HKD, and three SGD. For the same period last year, DBS was involved in eight issuances, none was denominated in SGD.\n\nChina now accounts for 20.5 per cent of worldwide emerging market bond issues, having printed US$47.2 billion from the beginning of this year to May 14, Thomson Reuters data showed. Last year's volume was US$72.5 billion - a record.\n\nThe demand for Chinese debt is more to do with a lack of alternatives than a specific preference for bonds from the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The reality is that Singapore bond investors are on the lookout for appropriate SGD bonds to invest in, it's just that more supply is coming from Chinese issuers,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nMr Schubert said issuance stemmed from many factors, including low interest rates and, in China's case, encouragement from the government.\n\n\"With respect to China, the government has been encouraging banks to rein in commercial lending given concerns over excess credit. Hence, much of the corporate lending that might have been bank loans is instead finding its way to the eurobond market,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee noted that the Chinese companies issuing in SGD were well-known Hong Kong and Singapore listed companies.\n\nFar East Horizon is a Hong Kong-listed Chinese financial services company and a unit of China's largest trading firm, Sinopec.\n\nYanlord, listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 2006, has been one of the 30 constituent stocks on the Straits Times Index since 2008.\n\nCCRE, also listed in Hong Kong, counts CapitaLand as a major shareholder. CapitaLand owns 27 per cent of the Chinese developer and has two of its directors on the board.\n\nChinese property companies have been in the spotlight on concerns over their gearing as growth in the country slows.\n\nA May 20 Financial Times report said the CCRE bonds have a BB- (stable) rating from Standard & Poor's, reflecting the company's \"increased debt leverage, growing competition in Henan province, and limited geographic diversity\". \"We assess the company's business risk profile as 'fair' and its financial risk profile as 'aggressive',\" the credit rating agency said.\n\nElaine Ngim, Coutts head of fixed income, Asia, said investors do take their cues from what's known as \"issuer comfort\" such as frequency of issuance and significant shareholders.\n\n\"The recent few Chinese issuers that have successfully come to the market already have a track record in the bond market, albeit in other currencies,\" she said.\n\nFar East Horizon has China state-owned enterprise linkages as well as a small stake by GIC, while CapitaLand has a stake in CCRE, she said.\n\n\"Investors are familiar with Yanlord as it is listed on the SGX, and this is not its first SGD bond issue. Investors are familiar with the previous convertible bond issued, where the majority of the issue has been redeemed.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Lloyds said the government's Help to Buy mortgage-support programme isn't driving prices in London, and said 2 per cent of purchases in the city this year have used the plan.\n\n\"The group continues to support the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme as it has raised confidence in the housing market, particularly outside of London,\" Noakes said.\n\nThe UK's coalition government is coming under pressure from opposition politicians to modify Help to Buy, which allows homebuyers to purchase properties with small deposits. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

If you're the Wolverine, it means having unique self-regeneration powers, a cool set of retractable alloy claws - and your own movie franchise. However, with power comes responsibility and once in a while, you may be called upon to save the world.\n\nAfter being restricted to a memorable cameo in the origins tale X-Men: First Class (2011), James Logan (Wolverine's given name) takes centre stage in X-Men: Days of Future Past, an ensemble film in which he travels back in time in an effort to change the past and save the future of the mutant race.\n\nIn a sense, this latest instalment, directed by Bryan Singer (who also helmed the first two X-Men films), gives audiences two for the price of one when Logan (Hugh Jackman) is tasked by Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) to return to the 1970s and persuade their younger selves (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender) to assist in altering history.\n\nThe solid story arc and vigorous tempo that characterised First Class (directed by Matthew Vaughn) is enhanced in the new movie by the two sets of characters, and compelling evidence that viewers are in for a quality blockbuster is provided in the opening scenes of a dystopian future featuring a few mutants fighting a desperate rearguard action against an army of deadly robots known as Sentinels.\n\nFrom here, the film transitions easily as Logan embarks on a mission to go retro and stop the renegade mutant Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the movie's requisite evil-scientist type and creator of the Sentinel programme.\n\nWith his death, an unbreakable chain of events will occur, ending with the destruction of the X-Men.\n\nThe script, by Simon Kinberg, has some fun with linking the story to actual historical events - conspiracy theorists will be mightily amused - but more importantly, the filmmakers have resolved to keep faith with the movie's predecessor by keeping faithful fans fully engaged: a complete 3D experience and US$225-million budget does no harm to the cause.\n\nThe X-Men series is never short of mutant characters with interesting powers and while some familiar faces are back in supporting roles - Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Storm (Halle Berry) and Shadowcat (Ellen Page) among them - the appearance of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a sullen teen capable of moving at warp speed, is the highlight this time around. He is enlisted by Logan to break the future Magneto out of a high-security prison, and both he and the audience have a great deal of fun while he does so.\n\nThere are more serious matters at stake, of course. Logan may be on a last-resort mission but no matter how dire the situation, followers of Marvel's multiple superheroes can rest secure in the knowledge that characters have an amazing propensity to survive. In the comic-book universe, history can be changed and people can come back from the dead: with films of this nature, the journey is always more interesting than the destination.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But this finding was met with considerable scepticism by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and property market watchers The Business Times spoke to.\n\nThe broader study used retail rental transaction data for 2000-2013 from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) to \"more closely approximate the experience of retailers on the ground\". MTI found that, while this can vary greatly, most increases were in line with the rate of inflation.\n\nOn average, out of the 2,100 leases renewed each year, rents are doubled or more than doubled in one per cent of them. These tended to be leases renewed after longer periods, or leases for shops in more attractive locations, MTI said.\n\nBut most of the rental hikes were not as dramatic. The median cumulative increase last year was 5.5 per cent, and 75 per cent of the leases were renewed at rental increases of 14 per cent or less.\n\nIn fact, in every year from 2000 to 2013, up to a quarter of retailers had the same or lower, rents on their renewed contracts, a proportion market watchers such as Teo Li Kim, research director at Cushman & Wakefield, found surprising.\n\nMTI permanent secretary Ow Foong Pheng said at the press briefing yesterday: \"People who don't experience any increase are quite happy to keep silent and the ones who are feeling the pain of big increases would make more noise, it could be that that's the case ... We're not disputing that some do experience significant increases but it's a small number.\"\n\nAssociation of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) president Kurt Wee, who raised the issue of sharp rental revisions hurting SMEs earlier this year, yesterday reiterated his call for more data.\n\n\"The effective rents are not transparent in the market. This means retailers are unable to plan and are subject to the sales tactics of landlords. It would be wonderful if every organisation has access to this data (from Iras)\" he said.\n\nMTI said that more comprehensive retail rental data can be expected at the end of this year. \"Existing retail companies looking to renew their leases or new retail companies looking to set up shops will be better placed to make more informed decisions on where to locate their shops to enjoy more competitive rents in the future,\" the report said.\n\nA second study, by MTI economists Bali Kaur Sodhi and Leong Chi Hoong, found that the higher rents at Reit-owned malls are due to their better location and renovated features - not their ownership by Reits.\n\nThe economists noted that a casual observation of rental trends would show that Reit-owned malls have higher rents than single-owner malls, and a higher compounded annual growth rate of 20 per cent between 2009 and 2013, compared to single-owner malls' 9.2 per cent. They think this fuelled the perception in recent years that Reits are driving up retail rents - which was also raised in Parliament last month.\n\nAfter controlling for characteristics such as asset enhancement works and how far a mall is from an MRT station, the economists found the level of rents in Reit-owned malls to be statistically no different from those at single-owner malls. Controlling for those characteristics, rental growth of Reit-owned malls between 2009 and 2013 also falls to 8.4 per cent, closer to the 6.7 per cent for single-owner malls.\n\nBut this need not mean that Reits are not responsible at all for the overall rise in retail rentals, market watchers said.\n\nAfter all, many property companies take reference from each other's practices and prices, said Nicholas Mak, executive director of research & consultancy at SLP International Property Consultants. \"What is undeniable is that the ownership of shopping malls is getting more concentrated in a smaller number of owners, which implies less competition,\" he added.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director of research & advisory at Colliers International, also noted that in Singapore, a few prominent property developers and owners control much of the existing shopping mall stock for investment, which excludes strata-titled retail space. And regardless of ownership structure, their objectives and strategies are often similar.\n\n\"If the stock in quality shopping malls can be sufficiently larger, with more developers or landlords adding greater diversity to the retail sector, retailers could then have more options and greater flexibility in their choice of malls, hence accommodating a wider variety of business cost thresholds,\" Ms Chia said.\n\nTo the SME, there is no difference between Reits and other large, well-financed institutional landlords, said ASME's Mr Wee. To him, the CAGR rental growth of 20 per cent from 2009-2013 cited in the study merely confirms aggressive pricing behaviour on the part of Reits. \"They are the price leaders and the price setters,\" he said.\n\nAnd from a retailer's perspective, HomeFix DIY managing director Low Cheong Kee thinks that Reits do hold better located malls for better fittings and costlier renovation. \"But other mall operators are also benchmarking against the Reit-owned malls, thus pushing overall rentals up,\" he said.\n\nThe MTI economists acknowledged that their study was limited, as it does not include indicators that affect how much mall owners can charge their tenants, such as footfall and profitability, for which data was not readily available.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She added that inward tourism numbers from the country continue to be strong.\n\n\"Where it's had an impact is really in terms of our airports. As an air hub, I think the reduction in terms of air travel into Thailand has been affected,\" explained Ms Ow, who noted that travel between Singapore and Thailand fell by 18 per cent over the first quarter.\n\nAdded Ms Ow: \"We will continue to watch the situation and see how it goes, but so far (the impact has been) minimal.\"\n\nEconomists The Business Times spoke to are adopting the same watchful wait-and-see stance. Unless tensions in Thailand escalate or turn violent, they say the impact on the broader Singapore economy \"will not be very significant\", and will continue to be contained.\n\nCertainly, as Singapore acts as an air transport gateway for tourists travelling to Thailand, economists agree that the Republic's airport traffic \"will see a fair bit of impact\" going forward.\n\nBut the flip side of that, noted DBS and CIMB economists, is the potential for the country to capture demand from travellers who may divert their plans away from Thailand, and into Singapore.\n\nAccording to Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho, a similar positive spill-over effect could happen on the manufacturing front. \"Singapore could benefit from having more manufacturing activity diverted from companies in Thailand. Other companies worried about supply chain security may transfer critical component production to Singapore,\" he said.\n\nCIMB economist Song Seng Wun agreed: \"With the military around to prevent further outbreaks of violence, we might (start to see) some much-needed calm ... Not that soldiers with guns is going to heighten consumer confidence - but at least you don't get a total breakdown in law and order (which would) undermine investor confidence (and affect) supply chains.\"\n\nAs for trade, based on 2013 data, the Thai market accounted for 3.7 per cent of Singapore's total exports, but was less significant in terms of imports for Singapore at 2.5 per cent.\n\nSaid OCBC economist Selena Ling: \"This suggests that in terms of any temporary domestic disruptions to the Thai economy, whether due to martial law or prolonged political uncertainty, the impact should be relatively muted from the trade angle.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is not fair that MAS and Malaysia should take the blame. For some reason the media will not print anything that involves Boeing or the CIA,\" wrote Mr Mahathir, who is known for his anti-western rhetoric.\n\nSimilar allegations were floated previously by a newspaper controlled by Malaysia's ruling party - which was under fire over a perceived bumbling and secretive handling of the crisis. The suggestion of American involvement was dismissed at the time by the US embassy in Malaysia.\n\nTwo films about MH370 were touted on Sunday to potential distributors at the Cannes Film Festival in France, with a trailer for one of them - \"The Vanishing Act\" - showing terrified passengers and a gun being brandished. The film was pitched as \"the untold story of the missing Malaysian plane\".\n\nOne of the first books about MH370 went on sale on Monday, suggesting it could have been shot down during a military drill in the South China Sea and the incident covered up.\n\nLondon-based author Nigel Cawthorne said there had been a joint Thai-US military exercise at the time and which was to include live-fire exercises. \"Say a participant accidentally shot down Flight MH370. Such things do happen. The cruiser USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655 over the Persian Gulf in 1988,\" he wrote.\n\n\"No one wants another Lockerbie, so those involved would have every reason to keep quiet about it,\" he added, referring to the blowing up of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland. A Libyan intelligence officer was convicted of that bombing.\n\nSingapore-based aviation analyst Terence Fan said that without evidence of the wreckage, \"you can't rule anything out but this is very unlikely\".\n\nMalaysia's government has said satellite data indicates the plane probably diverted to the Indian Ocean and crashed after running out of fuel. But nothing has been found despite weeks of extensive searches at the surface and on the seabed. Malaysia has said it would review the satellite data and reassess the search, possibly deploy more undersea search assets. Malaysia has announced no findings from various investigations into what caused MH370's disappearance.\n\nSurveys have suggested most Malaysians suspect the corruption-prone government is hiding something, while one in 10 Americans believe \"space aliens, time travellers or beings from another dimension\" were involved, according to an earlier CNN poll. Leading theories being probed by investigators include a possible hijacking, rogue pilot action or mechanical failure. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

There are two aspects of the result that are particularly striking. The first is that having won 282 out of 543 seats, the incoming BJP government led by Narendra Modi will be the first to win an absolute majority since 1984; the era of messy coalition politics which has dogged India for the last 30 years is over, at least for now. The second, which is perhaps equally important, is that the BJP was able to win votes that cut across caste, class and, to some extent, regional and even religious lines which have traditionally defined electoral performance in India. This suggests that the era of \"identity politics\", too, may have passed. Issues of development, governance, decisive leadership, performance and delivery have instead come to the fore. If this is a permanent shift in the expectations of the electorate, it could have huge implications for the India story going forward.\n\nEconomic analysts have, almost without exception, hailed India's election result with enthusiasm. Moody's Investor Service has described it as a \"credit positive\" event. Morgan Stanley has suggested that it could spell the end of stagflation in India and has upped its growth forecasts. Portfolio investors have rushed into India's stock markets, which have soared more than 30 per cent since September, when Mr Modi was first named as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, and the Indian rupee has hit an 11-month high.\n\nBut while this resurgence of confidence is encouraging and perhaps justified, it will take more than confidence to lift the Indian economy. The challenges are well documented. On the macroeconomic front, India has two chronic problems, high inflation and a large fiscal deficit. It also has an infrastructure deficit, which in turn has handicapped the manufacturing sector, wherein lies the promise of the millions of new jobs that Mr Modi's government says it is determined to create. A thicket of regulatory obstacles and problems with land acquisition have made business difficult, for Indians and foreigners alike. On the social front, standards of health and education, although improving, are still abysmal.\n\nAlthough the incoming government has yet to spell out its economic agenda in detail, from what we know so far, its priorities are pragmatic. Mr Modi has talked of less government and more governance, of a major boost for infrastructure and manufacturing, a more business-friendly environment including openness to foreign direct investment and speedier decision-making. These goals may be difficult to achieve but they are not unrealistic. Given the scale of its mandate, the Modi government has a historic opportunity to bring lasting and positive change to an economy and a country that has, for too long, punched below its weight.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the biggest deal to date, Braemar, whose businesses include ship broking, said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the entire share capital of ACM. \"What this transaction is about is growing our shipbroking presence collectively,\" said Braemar chief executive James Kidwell.\n\nShip owners ordered large numbers of vessels between 2007 and 2009 just as the global economy sank into crisis, plunging the sector into one of its worst ever downturns. Prospects have brightened in recent months, with a pick-up in global trade helping to absorb the ship glut.\n\nAs sector conditions improve, many ship brokers view bigger scale operations with global teams as the best way to position themselves ahead of a full market recovery. \"It appears we are past the worst of the cycle. It is certainly not a convincing recovery, and ship brokers are looking for ways to continue earnings growth,\" said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

This follows the group's annual general meeting (AGM) in The Hague on Tuesday, where Ms Goh and Ms Woertz received a respective 99 and 98 per cent of votes.\n\nEarlier this month, Shell implemented a US$2.3 billion write-off in refining assets, most of it for its 500,000-barrel Singapore Bukom refinery, which is its largest worldwide in terms of capacity. This follows falling margins amid a global refining overcapacity.\n\nShell chairman Ben van Beurden said at the AGM that the group will still hold on to its refining business despite shedding many underperforming downstream assets including those closed earlier in Australia and Europe. He insisted that the company will retain the refining segment as part of an integrated model.\n\nThis reinforces chief financial officer Simon Henry's move at Shell's earlier Q1 results briefing to de-link the impairment (on its books) and the portfolio action. \"In the case of Singapore, in particular, the refinery is connected to a profitable chemicals asset, and therefore there is value in the chain overall,\" said Mr van Beurden, referring to the Bukom refinery's integration with its petrochemicals operations here.\n\nMs Goh is the first Singaporean to join the Shell board. A chartered accountant, she is non-executive director of DBS, CapitaLand and SATS. She previously held various senior management positions with Standard Chartered Bank and was its Singapore CEO from 2001 to 2006.\n\nMs Woertz began her career as a certified public accountant before joining Gulf Oil in 1977 where she held various positions in refining, marketing, strategic planning and finance. Following the merger of Gulf and Chevron in 1987, she was president of Chevron Canada and later Chevron International Oil Company. With the merger of Chevron and Texaco in 2001, she was appointed executive vice-president responsible for global refining, marketing, lubricant, and supply and trading operations. Her industry experience will be especially relevant as Shell looks to restructure.\n\nShell chairman Jorma Ollila wants Shell to improve the diversity of its board, where women and people of different ethnicities are under-represented. He had earlier set a target for Shell to have women occupy a quarter of its board, including the addition of a member with an Asia-Pacific background.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is designed to operate in waters of 400 feet and drill to depths of 30,000 feet.\n\nThis latest contract brings Sembcorp Marine's total new orders secured this year to S$1.93 billion. The group's net order book now stands at S$13.2 billion, with deliveries extending to 2019.\n\nAnalysts from OCBC Investment Research and DMG & Partners Securities pointed out that the new win is a positive as it adds to Sembcorp Marine's order book, meeting 48 per cent and 39 per cent of their full year estimates, respectively.\n\nOCBC's Low Pei Han said that the price of this rig is higher than the US$192 million price tag for a similar order the group had from Seadrill in 2010, due to a general price increase in jack-up rigs and also because the current unit has more customisation. Lee Yue Jer from DMG added that Sembcorp Marine's first quarter operating margins were stable at 11.1 per cent, even as overall revenue fell 21 per cent from the previous quarter, indicating a core margin recovery. Therefore, with more revenue expected to be recognised over the coming quarters, the group's margins should improve.\n\nBoth DMG and OCBC have maintained their buy call on the stock with a target price of S$5 and S$4.90, respectively.\n\nOthers are less optimistic and believe that the new contract win is not enough to change the challenging outlook for the rigbuilder.\n\nClement Chen of Barclays Equity Research said that despite the new rig, he continues to see risks to Sembcorp Marine's overall margin outlook, from its remaining backlog of seven drillships, which are to be partly completed in Brazil, as well as some remaining deepwater platforms/inter- vention risks where margins could surprise on the downside.\n\nThe firm believes Sembcorp Marine's order and margin outlook for 2014 remain unattractive, with weakening global offshore markets likely to dampen new rig orders. It maintains its equal weight rating for the stock with a target price of S$4.80.\n\nSembcorp Marine shares closed trading yesterday at S$3.98, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Married couples, however, felt more financially secure than singles - 45 per cent of married couples said they felt financially secure, compared to just 37 per cent of single Singaporeans.\n\nChris Gill, general manager for South-east Asia at FPI, attributed much of the growing insecurity to external events such as China's economic slowdown and the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nHe added: \"Closer to home, the rising cost of living including the high property prices could also be key elements that have contributed to perceptions of financial insecurity.\"\n\nIn terms of savings, the top two savings priorities for Singaporeans remained retirement and \"rainy day\" emergencies, according to the report\n\nAmong Singaporean respondents, 61 per cent indicated saving for emergencies as their savings priority. Additionally, 72 per cent intended to save for retirement, which was the number one savings priority among Singaporeans.\n\nSaving for medical expenses came in third place, with 39 per cent of Singaporeans considering it a priority. It overtook saving for children's education in the savings priority rankings for the first time.\n\n\"It is encouraging to note affluent investors are aware of the need to put aside part of their savings in a bid to provide them with the assurance that their retirement and future medical bills are taken care of,\" said Mr Gill.\n\nIn terms of investor sentiment, a fall in the FPI Investor Attitudes Index for Singapore from 22 points in Oct 2013 to 13 points in the recent report was indicative of investor uncertainty in the current investment climate.\n\nDespite the fall in the indices, investor sentiment may be more bullish going forward, said James Tan, managing director at FPI.\n\n\"We see a higher risk appetite among Singapore respondents,\" said Mr Tan. \"Gold, collectibles, money/\n\ncurrency markets are losing their popularity and property dropped most, while equities/shares remain the most attractive class among others. We also see a slightly more positive sentiment on developed markets which have not entirely recovered from their crises.\"\n\nThe survey was conducted from April 7 to 16 through online interviews, with more than 1,000 respondents hailing from Hong Kong and Singapore. There were 501 Singaporean respondents, all of whom had at least $80,000 in investible assets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Since then, Hong Kong has fared better than Singapore, until this year.\n\nWhile IMD's latest finding did not surprise many, economists here cautioned against complacency and overlooking competition from the region and beyond.\n\n\"With Malaysia (No 12), Japan (21) and Indonesia (37) all making gains in IMD's 2014 ranking, and committing to improve their infrastructure, policymakers here should be mindful that these countries will just need incremental reforms to climb the ranks,\" said CIMB economist Song Seng Wun.\n\nHe cited the development of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur (KL) high-speed rail. While this will benefit Singapore, it will also enhance KL's competitiveness and status as a viable alternative to do business in.\n\n\"Developed economies such as Europe and the US are also recovering, and this presents an abundance of business opportunities. Business costs there are likely to be lower, labour cheaper, and workers generally more hungry for work - all of which are factors that will make them more attractive,\" Mr Song said.\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling said Singapore did well despite the domestic challenges of a tight labour market and elevated operating cost environment.\n\nIn fact, Singapore came in first globally for having an image abroad that encourages business development, according to a survey of executives based here.\n\nExecutives in Germany (No 2) and Ireland (3) were also found to be bullish about their countries' overseas image, while those in the US (24) were \"far gloomier\" about theirs, possibly due to \"international conflicts and domestic political gridlock\", said IMD.\n\nNonetheless, it sees the reign of the US as a reflection of its resilient economy, better employment numbers, and dominance in technology and infrastructure.\n\nIMD's report also included measures of each country's government efficiency, economic performance, business efficiency and infrastructure, which collectively determined its competitiveness.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The newbuildings, when complete, will be equipped with eco-design hulls and fuel-efficient engines.\n\nBW's existing fleet of 113 vessels includes crude oil supertankers, refined oil tankers, LNG and LPG carriers, chemical tankers and floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units.\n\nAndreas Sohmen-Pao, the chief executive officer of the BW Group, said: \"Stream Tankers has a fleet of quality vessels and newbuildings, and BW is pleased to be acquiring this fleet. With this purchase, we will be able to strengthen our service offering in the chemical tanker segment.\"\n\nThe day before, BW had unveiled BW Pacific, a joint venture (JV) with investment manager PAG, formerly known as the Pacific Alliance Group.\n\nThe JV, coming as BW gains ground in the product tanker market, will purchase 10 modern medium-range product tankers from Elandra Pte Ltd, a company associated with Vitol Energy (Bermuda) Ltd.\n\nMr Sohmen-Pao said: \"BW is pleased to form a joint venture with one of Asia's leading investment managers and to have PAG as a partner as it expands in the product tanker segment.\"\n\nChris Gradel, the founder and managing partner of PAG, said: \"PAG is delighted to have such a blue-chip partner in shipping like the BW Group. This is a very interesting time in the cycle for the industry and our joint venture with BW presents our investors with a unique opportunity to capture the potential upside in a recovery while relying on the operational excellence of a true industry leader.\"\n\nBW Pacific will have a fleet of 37 medium-range and long-range product tankers and will be managed by the BW Group.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is no guarantee this process will result in a binding offer for DTZ,\" Mr McArdle added.\n\nUGL has struggled with high debt levels and falling profit as its main engineering services division experiences declining revenue as a result of a mining slowing affecting Australia. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

It pointed to \"the pace of QE (quantitative easing) tapering\" in the United States and \"the ongoing restructuring\" of the Chinese economy.\n\nSingapore's total trade expanded 7.2 per cent year-on-year in January- March, almost double the 3.8 per cent growth in the final three months of 2013.\n\nNODX dipped 1 per cent in the first quarter, only by half as much as the 2.1 per cent drop in the previous quarter.\n\nOnly non-oil re-exports slackened, with their increase easing from 16.6 per cent in October-December 2013 to 14.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nMeasured over three months, total trade rose a seasonally adjusted 2.6 per cent in the first quarter, after rising 1 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nBut NODX showed no similar quarter-on-quarter improvement as it slipped 0.8 per cent, against a 0.7 per cent dip in the quarter before.\n\nIE Singapore blamed both NODX's year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter drops on \"lower shipments of electronic NODX which outweighed the increase in non-electronic NODX\".\n\nDomestic shipments of electronic products - which made up 28.3 per cent of total NODX - tumbled 12.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, following a 6.9 per cent decline in the previous quarter.\n\n\"The decrease in electronic NODX can be attributed to lower domestic exports of integrated circuits (-16.4 per cent), parts of personal computer (-24.1 per cent) and disk media products (-16.5 per cent),\" said IE Singapore.\n\nNon-electronic NODX, which was 71.7 per cent of total NODX, climbed 4.5 per cent in January-March this year, against a 0.3 per cent rise in October-December 2013.\n\n\"The increase in non-electronic NODX can be attributed to higher domestic exports of petrochemicals (+39.1 per cent), structures of ships & boats (+1,764.2 per cent) and printed matter (+40.7 per cent).\"\n\nAmong Singapore's top 10 markets, shipments to China, the US, Malaysia, Taiwan and Indonesia jumped in the first three months of the year, while they fell in the rest of the markets.\n\nHong Kong, South Korea and the European Union were the biggest contributors to NODX's fall in the first quarter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of course, it is far better to avoid accidents in the first place. Moreover, the recent sinking of the South Korean ferry Sewol is yet another reminder that accidents can also cost lives.\n\nOver the past two or three decades, the concept of onboard safety culture has been developed to the extent that it should now be underpinned on every ship by the International Safety Management (ISM) Code.\n\nIn practice, there is a sad lack of an effective safety culture on many vessels. It is fairly easy to see in hindsight when this has been the case, by looking through accident reports.

It's now urging politicians to drop a 22 per cent capital gains tax on housing which, the agency said on May 6, has kept the market \"boiling\" under a shortage of supply.\n\nWhile record house price gains have made a lot of Swedes rich, many are reluctant to move because they don't want to pay the gains tax. The housing board says that's distorting property prices and often keeping Swedes in accommodation that's unsuited to their needs. Apartment prices nationwide have almost tripled since early last decade, and homeowners have amassed a record level of debt to pay for their properties, central bank data shows.\n\n\"This so-called moving tax, coupled with traditional moving costs, means that we use our homes in the wrong way - we live too big, too small and in the wrong place,\" Bengt Hansson, an analyst at the board, said by phone last Wednesday. \"The problem is that it becomes very expensive to change homes.\"\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, which is trailing behind a Social Democrat-led opposition in most polls ahead of September elections, has shown reluctance to tamper with Sweden's property taxes. Finance Minister Anders Borg said last week he needs evidence that such taxes hurt mobility, while opening up for a review if the housing board presents a convincing analysis.\n\nHome prices have kept climbing even after Sweden took a number of steps to try to cool the market, including a cap on mortgage lending and higher risk weights on banks' mortgage assets.\n\nThe latest data from April showed apartment prices rose an annual 8 per cent while single-family homes gained 6 per cent. That's prompted warnings from the government and central bank that the development isn't sustainable.\n\nMr Borg has signalled greater willingness to change rules that affect construction. Such regulation \"also plays a big role\", he said. \"It's very complicated and costly to build and I think that's been worrisome.\"\n\nThe Social Democrats have no \"proposals to remove the capital gains tax\", Fredrik Kornebaeck, a spokesman for the party, said in an emailed response to questions on Friday.\n\nConcern over debt and rising home prices has kept the central bank from lowering rates further even after bouts of deflation. Critics of the bank's policy, including members of its own rate setting board, have argued that excessive focus on the property market has kept rates too high and hurt the labour market. Sweden's 8.6 per cent jobless rate is Scandinavia's highest.\n\nThe central bank concluded in a report this month that Sweden's household debt problem is worse than previously estimated, reaching 370 per cent of disposable incomes for homeowners. The following day, the financial regulator tightened capital rules for banks, partly in response to the rising imbalances.\n\nEconomists and policymakers are also calling for measures such as more residential construction and laxer building rules. There's also discussion around forcing households to amortise their debts faster.\n\nMr Hansson has estimated that Sweden has a shortage of about 150,000 homes, which would cost about 400 billion kronor (S$75.8 billion) to build. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The dual-key concept is one strategy adopted by developers to move the sales of these larger units,\" said Alice Tan, director and head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank.\n\nAnother strategy deployed by developers is having larger units to be prime-facing, she added.\n\nThere has been no let-up in developers' interest in the dual-key concept yet. In the first two months of this year, four newly launched projects - Riverbank @ Fernvale, Rivertree Residences, The Santori and Lakeville - have dual-key units.\n\nA dual-key home comprises two sub-units with two separate keys and, in some cases, separate entrances. When it was first introduced in 1986 by the HDB, it was meant to promote multi-generational living.\n\nThis concept has since been adopted in private housing, starting with Frasers Centrepoint's 712-unit executive condominium (EC) Caspian in 2009 where it introduced 15 dual-key units called \"Trio Homes\".\n\nSubsequent condos that adopted the dual-key concept include UOL's Waterbank at Dakota launched in 2010 and Koh Brothers' Parc Olympia launched in 2012. Owners of dual-key units could also use the sub-unit as a home office or rent it out.\n\nOut of 74 large-scale private condos and ECs (projects with at least 400 units) launched between 2011 and the first two months of this year, 35 projects rolled out a total of 1,976 dual-key units. Developers have allocated more units for dual-key, from an average 3.4 per cent of units in a project in 2011 to 7.5 per cent in 2013.\n\n\"Developers of private non-landed projects are recognising the potential of the dual-key segment and are capitalising on buyers' preference for such a living concept,\" Ms Tan said.\n\nThe additional buyers' stamp duty (ABSD) also tilts the favour to dual-key units as buyers can stay in the unit while renting out the sub-unit, instead of buying two separate homes.\n\nBut demand for dual-key units has softened; their take-up rate cooled from 100 per cent in 2011, 84 per cent in 2012 to 58 per cent in 2013 while the maximum price premium of dual-key units over similar-sized non-dual key units eased from 16 per cent in 2012 to 12 per cent in 2013.\n\nMs Tan noted that this is in part due to a low take-up for most of the projects following property cooling measures and the loans cap under the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework.\n\nDual-key units still \"offer a value proposition to a wider group of potential buyers\", she said. Buyers of dual-key units are mainly in their late 20s to mid-30s, reflecting the trend of young families wanting to stay near their parents.\n\nA significant 81 per cent of dual-key units are located in the North-east and East. Ms Tan said there could be new opportunities for developers to include more dual-key units for projects in the West where more regional and sub-regional centres are taking shape over the next five years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The latest step along this road is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's move to revise the official \"interpretation\" of the postwar Japanese constitution.\n\nMr Abe presents this as a move designed to enable Japan to fulfil its global responsibilities by allowing it to come to the aid of allies in the event that they are attacked, and to engage in \"collective self-defence\" - thus making Japan a more \"normal\" country in this regard. But it is not so much the content of what he is proposing that provides ground for concern as the context in which it is being proposed. That context is defined by a more nationalist Japan and by China's growing projection of its maritime power and territorial ambition in East Asia.\n\nIt is also the manner in which Mr Abe's move is being made that gives rise to unease. By reinterpreting the constitution, he hopes to avoid the need for a formal \"amendment\". The obvious \"ally\" to whose collective self-defence Japan would be expected to contribute in an emergency is the United States, with which Tokyo has a mutual security treaty. It is no surprise, therefore, that Washington is supporting a more proactive role by Japan. It is possible to envisage situations in which the US could come under attack from North Korean missiles overflying Japan, which Japan would be in a position to intercept by engaging in collective self-defence. Also, threats to US ships attacked near Japan could be countered.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Citizens, meanwhile, will be equipped with the skills to take on a wide range of specialist, managerial and leadership roles.\n\n\"We will strengthen our continuing education and training system,\" the government said, adding that it would also develop career pathways as well as improve applied learning tracks and specialist programmes.\n\nThe statement went on to stress that all young Singaporeans would be given the chance to maximise their potential through a good education, regardless of their family circumstances or background.\n\nMinistries yesterday began mapping out their respective policies and plans in response to Dr Tan's address. Instead of individual statements as in the past, the responses this time round have been grouped under different themes. These will be announced progressively throughout this week.\n\nThe first batch of nine ministries gave details about how they were working to make Singapore a nation of opportunity, which is the first theme.\n\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) shared how it was setting aside over $300 million over the next three years to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their restructuring efforts.\n\nThe ministry is also spending $1 billion from the National Productivity Fund on productivity programmes, mainly targeted at SMEs.\n\n\"As Singapore embarks on the economic transformation journey, we must raise productivity at all levels,\" said MTI.\n\n\"Our companies need to restructure and build new capabilities to compete effectively in the new operating environment,\" said the ministry, as it pledged to continue providing support to firms to stay the course in economic restructuring.\n\nAs far as jobs are concerned, the ministry expects about 40,000 to 45,000 young Singaporeans to enter the job market each year over the next three years, with two-thirds of them aspiring to hold PMET positions.\n\nThe Manpower Ministry said it would enhance job facilitation efforts for all displaced workers, and improve accessibility to training for SMEs and their workers.\n\nIt will also, among other plans, study how unions can better represent PME interests and explore access to affordable dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, the government will continue to upgrade Singapore's port and airport and enhance the country's connectivity.\n\n\"We will maintain our lead as a centre for international financial, legal, and intellectual property services. Our network of trade and economic agreements will link Singapore businesses to opportunities in other growing economies,\" said the government in its statement.\n\n\"Singapore businesses that do well locally and abroad will, in turn, generate better prospects for our people.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is a natural evolution. It is something we have seen in the United States, and it is moving to Asia.\"\n\nBut Willard McLane, head of Asean corporate and investment banking at Citi, noted that the current level of activism in this region is still relatively modest.\n\n\"I don't see much shareholder activism in Singapore in the way we see it in the US, for example. We haven't seen a lot of cases where shareholders are publicly promoting agendas or blocking deals,\" he said.\n\nBut not all calls for higher offers are successful.\n\nUnited Industrial Corp stuck to its takeover offer price for subsidiary Singapore Land (SingLand), though the share price movement of SingLand - as it traded above the offer price - suggested that shareholders were looking for more.\n\nBut in other cases, more money was put on the table. Besides CapitaLand, the consortium led by tycoon Ong Beng Seng and Wheelock Properties also boosted its offer for shares in Hotel Properties.\n\nThere are several factors fanning this wave of privatisations. Bankers note that many deals were prompted by cheap financing, and the lacklustre market which often \"undervalues\" stocks.\n\nThe equity markets have valued real estate companies at \"a significant discount to their underlying values\", noted Galen Lee, UBS' South-east Asia head of real estate.\n\n\"We are seeing some real estate companies undertake privatisations of their subsidiaries to streamline and re-align the groups' businesses and portfolios,\" he said.\n\nIn Singapore, the privatisation trend may also be driven by the cooling measures affecting listed real estate developers, Mr Lee added. This has significantly depressed many property stocks.\n\nDespite the public protestations, Mr Granger noted that the average premium - which has historically been about 25-30 per cent - has stayed stable in Singapore over the past few years.\n\nMeanwhile, M&A activity across Asia continues to buzz.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan), the total value of deals in the first quarter of the year stood at US$102 billion, up 36 per cent from the same period a year ago, according to Mergermarket. This is the strongest first-quarter deal flow on Mergermarket's record, which began in 2001.\n\nSingapore companies are also starting to get into the pan-Asian M&A party.\n\nTemasek Holdings' US$5.7 billion purchase of a 25 per cent stake in drugstore chain Watsons was the third-largest deal announced in the period.\n\nBankers note that Temasek is likely in an investment cycle, and has been fairly active in snapping up stakes in non-financial companies. It has also \"doubled down\" on Olam International, one banker noted.\n\nBut Temasek has also not shied away from offloading companies in which it has a significant stake. STATS ChipPAC, which counts Temasek as its major shareholder, announced last Friday that it had received a \"non-binding expression of interest\" from a buyer. The semiconductor assembly firm has a market cap of just over $1 billion.\n\nAs Singapore companies regionalise, more outbound activity will be expected in the quarters ahead, as opposed to inbound deals, said Mr McLane.\n\nMeanwhile in Singapore, bankers are watching for potential consolidation among locally-listed mid-sized real estate investment trusts (Reits), though they note that some of these deals may be complicated in structure.\n\n\"In an environment where everyone is expecting interest rates to rise, yield is becoming less attractive,\" said Mr Granger, referring to Reits.\n\nThere may be some spillover activity in Asia as large multinational corporations (MNCs) consolidate, observed Mr McLane. There is also likely to be more private-equity transactions in Singapore, he noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, we have been targeting to start up earlier and I am pleased to see it is happening soon.\"\n\n\"We have achieved operational readiness and are fully geared for start-up and commercial operations,\" he added. This includes staffing, where JAC is now at full strength, with all departments working together seamlessly, and employees well-trained for their roles, he said.\n\nLocated on a 58-hectare site on Jurong Island, the JAC complex includes a 100,000-barrels-per-day condensate splitter which - unlike an oil refinery processing crude oil - will process natural gas condensates from the Middle East into naphtha for its main aromatics complex.\n\nThe complex's \"main value driver\" will be its production of 1.5 million tonnes per annum of aromatics, comprising 800,000 tonnes of paraxylene, 438,000 tonnes of benzene and 200,000 tonnes of orthoxylene. The aromatics have a wide range of applications across myriad industries which include textiles and clothing, construction, tyres, sports equipment and plastics.\n\n\"Demand for these aromatics products, which are key raw materials used in a wide range of end applications, is steadily increasing, particularly in China and India,\" JAC said.\n\nOther high-value products co-produced in the process include jet fuel, ultra-low sulphur diesel, light naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen and fuel oil. When the plant is fully operational, a total of 2.5 million tonnes of petroleum products will be produced each year.\n\nJAC's start-up will also trigger the first-time use of the $1.7 billion Jurong Rock Cavern, as the aromatics complex is the first customer for the underground oil storage. It will occupy most of JRC's first two caverns of 480,000 cubic metres.\n\nDespite the challenging times, what has supported the project is that JAC is practically \"underwritten\" by its eight shareholders, made up of international feedstock suppliers, petrochemical product offtakers, trade and financial investors, as well as the Singapore government.\n\nThese are SK Group, Jiangsu Sanfangxiang Group, Arovin of Vinmar Group, Glencore, Shefford Investments, UVM, EDB Investments and Essar Group.\n\n\"Our portfolio of suppliers and offtakers are reputable industry players with established track records and solid credit ratings.

The fact that it employs thousands, mostly ethnic Malays, is another consideration.\n\nEven so, after three major business turnaround programmes in the past 15 years - and an estimated RM20 billion injected via government-backed bonds and cash calls - yet another bail-out will be difficult for taxpayers and minorities to stomach.\n\nMoreover, the crisis is far deeper this time around as MAS's reputation and ticket sales have been considerably hurt by the mysterious disappearance of MH370 enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 onboard. Nearly two-thirds of its passengers were mainland Chinese.\n\nThe possibility of MAS going bankrupt had not been contemplated openly, especially by any Malaysian leader, including Mr Najib, who had been persuaded by Maseu at the end of 2012 to scrap a proposed equity swap between controlling shareholders of MAS and budget carrier AirAsia, and a strategic alliance between both carriers.\n\nThe objective of the alliance was to have both carriers cooperate and operate in a manner of mutual benefit given the cut-throat competition and over capacity in the sector.\n\nBankruptcy is only one of several options being considered to salvage MAS. The sale and flotation of its more profitable units such as engineering and short-haul arm are further options but whether such measures can sustain it in the longer term remains uncertain.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How is your organisation gearing up to ride the market opportunities?\n\nPublished Sun, May 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nChaly Mah\n\nChairman of Deloitte Singapore and\n\nCEO of Deloitte Asia Pacific\n\nTHE AEC is a journey that will unfold over time. It is not, as many believe it to be, a ''Big Bang''. Much has been done on the regulatory front but the changes are not yet fully understood by the business community.\n\nThe imperative now is for businesses to consider and implement the strategic and operational choices that will become possible with the creation of a trading bloc with a population of some 600 million, with free flow of skilled labour, services, investments and capital.\n\nWinners will adopt a broader mindset and transform their thinking from competing within national boundaries to winning on a regional basis.\n\nWe urge governments to press forward with a stepped implementation in 2015 rather than wait for all member states to be fully prepared. By creating an integrated Deloitte South-east Asia firm in 2006, we can easily leverage our regional platform to deploy our resources across all markets to help our clients tap the opportunities presented by the AEC.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Asean Economic Community (AEC) can benefit many industries when it truly can result in a freer flow of people, products and services, compared to the status quo. It would be an added boon when the financial and banking industry is deregulated as well, so that more foreign banks can be set up in host countries. This will facilitate trade immensely. Organisations gearing up to ride the market opportunities will need to increase their local presence.\n\nI will prioritise the countries where I would want to increase my direct investments and presence in. For the other countries, I will look at establishing distribution channels. Health care is one industry that I have been focusing on in recent years, in particular, telehealth consulting services for triage management, chronic disease management, wellness management, care for the aged and help for caregivers.\n\nI hope that with the establishment of the AEC, it would be easier for me to set up cross-border call centres, which can mutually support one another in the larger Asean framework. This will help me tackle the manpower shortages, especially of qualified nurses, and the higher costs of operations in Singapore.\n\nBusinesses will still have to pay particular attention to country and political risks when embarking on any expansion plan in the AEC. Such risks can erode any economic benefits derived from the AEC. A case in point is the recent attacks on Chinese factories and firms in Vietnam, arising from the dispute between China and Vietnam over territorial rights in the South China Sea. Businesses will just have to be mindful that if there is one show stopper in the AEC, it would be country and political risks. In this regard, many lessons can be learnt from the European Community.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nTHE impending Asean Economic Community is an exciting time for the 10 nations involved. Not only does it allow us to work as a single market and become more competitive, but it will enable the region to act together with the global economy combining 600 million people divided by various languages, religions, political agendas and economic standings.\n\nSince the global economic crisis, investors have looked to Asia - which remained relatively unscathed - as an investment haven. For both international and local investors there will be rewards as the anticipated economic growth and integration of capital markets will help generate higher yields and increased capital appreciation on real estate investments.\n\nThe Asean Economic Community will most certainly give businesses a number of advantages to drive forward with future development plans. For instance, for Castlewood Group as a property developer we should see a considerable reduction in the price of construction equipment, and transportation, labour and transaction costs. At the same time, there will be an increase in overseas investment into the region as investors try to capitalise on the rise of South-east Asia. Increased competition across the market will drive productivity, which should also help to drive down costs.\n\nThe newly formed community will also present us with more opportunities to further expand our operations into neighbouring countries. While there will be a number of development opportunities for us, we must also take note that the free market will allow skilled labour to move freely across markets. This means that while we will have access to a larger pool of labour, we might also lose some of the skilled workers we have come to rely on.\n\nIt is vital that all potential impacts, both positive and negative, are assessed and contingency plans put in place prior to the launch of the community. It is not only the respective governments' responsibility to identify the impact but also for each individual firm to assess the potential implications on their business.\n\nThe introduction of the community has long-term benefits but its implementation will not be without teething problems; we have to remember that there are 10 different countries, representing different cultures and attitudes. Resolving internal conflicts or difficult issues will challenge the unity of the community, but we must remain vigilant and open-minded to ensure that we tackle them in the best way we can.\n\nStuart Green\n\nCEO Asia Pacific\n\nInterbrand\n\nWITH the AEC launching in 2015, we are seeing many organisations preparing their businesses from an operations perspective but perhaps not giving enough thought to the opportunities and challenges for their brands. The AEC will lead to tougher competition, short-lived competitive advantage, and therefore an increase in the brand's contribution to shareholder value. For those that seize the opportunities, the brand is one of the few business assets that can provide long-term differentiation and impact business performance.\n\nStrong brands influence customer choice and create loyalty; attract, retain, and motivate talent; and lower the cost of financing. Well-managed brands create ongoing demand, allowing their owners to enjoy higher returns and mitigate risks. This strikes me as directly supporting the very objectives of the AEC.\n\nInterbrand has a diverse range of insightful thinkers bringing together a combination of rigorous strategy and analytics with world-class design creativity to help its clients create and manage brand value in all market dynamics. We hope to work with our clients in Asean to help them be prepared for the opportunities that the AEC may bring in 2015 and beyond.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nGENERALLY, an Asean Economic Community in 2015 will create greater market opportunities for most businesses. The establishment of AEC is set to eliminate trade barriers, facilitating the free flow of goods, services and capital within the bloc.\n\nNorth America went through a similar process with the creation of Nafta many years ago. The creation of an integrated single market will also have a major impact on the mobility of talent. This relates to our business at Maachu which aims to bring the best talent to employers and likewise the best opportunities to candidates.\n\nHowever, we have to acknowledge that this may be one of the most challenging aspects of AEC that the governments need to grapple with. To encourage trade and investments, there needs to be ''liquidity of talent''. Governments will need to manage this proactively as investments cannot flow freely without a corresponding increase in the ''liquidity of talent''.\n\nJoseph Lim\n\nVice-President, Asia Pacific\n\nFNT Software\n\nTHE impending transformation of South-east Asia into the Asean Economic Community next year comes some 13 years after the European Union became one common market. Eight years after German headquartered FNT Software operated as a corporate entity in individual European markets, the union transformed the geography into a single market and production base, with free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled labour, and freer flow of capital.\n\nOn hindsight, despite the trials and tribulations of the EU, as a union, we know that there has been a lot of give-and-take in the interests of the union's betterment. This has benefited the IT industry and others and similarly it should for Asean.\n\nFNT Software is a relatively new entrant to the Asian market and from where we came, we view the establishment of the common union market as a crossing of a major bridge in a long journey. One area where the European economy has benefited from the integration is in the area of data centre infrastructure management, a specialised area which will come to bear as South-east Asia becomes a common market. In this regard, we view Malaysia and Indonesia as promising opportunities.\n\nRick Scurfield\n\nSenior Vice-President and General Manager\n\nNetApp, Asia Pacific\n\nWITH the formation of the AEC, South-east Asia stands to become a bigger player in the global economy. We can expect a proliferation of start-ups as well as rapid growth across sectors such as banking, manufacturing and telecommunication. With the advent of the AEC, we anticipate that governments will also invest heavily in building both physical and technological infrastructure to ensure their nations have a competitive foothold in the new marketplace.\n\nDeveloping nations and small businesses may even leapfrog their more technologically advanced counterparts with the adoption of cloud and other cutting-edge solutions that will help them challenge more established players in the AEC.\n\nThe common market will bring tremendous opportunities for businesses and it is important for companies to collaborate with experienced technology providers that can assist in designing and building the right technology architecture, whether the information resides in the cloud or on premise.\n\nKenneth Arredondo\n\nPresident & General Manager, Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nCA Technologies\n\nTHE Asia Pacific region, including Japan and particularly South-east Asia, is one of the most dynamic regions of growth for CA Technologies globally. If we look at the 10 countries that make up Asean, we see diversely different markets governed by their own sets of economic policies and regulations.\n\nBut if we look at Asean as a single economic entity, it would rank as the world's eighth largest economy with a largely-young population base of 600 million people. I strongly believe that the Asean Economic Community will unlock the full growth potential of the region, enabling businesses within and from outside Asean to thrive in a diverse area now united by principles of free trade.\n\nThe AEC framework will enhance the flow of talents and technologies in the IT industry, allowing global IT companies like CA to better serve the region with greater uniformity and economies of scale. Ultimately, this means that CA will be able to launch new technologies and expand our presence much faster across the region.\n\nWith AEC in place potentially in 2015, we hope to accelerate the expansion of our reach across Asean markets from our regional headquarters in Singapore, enabling our software to help nations and businesses drive greater competitive advantage in this application economy.\n\nRavi Rajendran\n\nVice-President & General Manager, Asean & India\n\nHitachi Data Systems\n\nTHE biggest opportunities created by the AEC are two-fold for Hitachi Data Systems: Firstly, as it becomes easier for businesses to expand across the region, companies will turn to seamless technologies to improve connectivity, manage data growth and enhance information flow across the region. Secondly, the AEC will create a more integrated region, presenting opportunities for sharing of ICT best practices, innovation and talent across the region, ensuring that Asean becomes more competitive on a global scale as enterprises aim to leverage technology to outpace their competitors.\n\nTogether with our parent company, Hitachi, we have engaged as ONE Hitachi to build our social innovation vision that lays the foundation for the future growth markets. As enterprises will depend on information innovation to drive their businesses in Asean, we will continue to be their strategic partner to create solutions that address real-world growth challenges the region will face in 2015.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nPresident, South Asia District\n\nUPS Asia Pacific\n\nUPS believes that free and open trade drives business and economic prosperity, and the 2015 Asean Economic Community, when fully enacted, is an exciting opportunity for the logistics industry. Customers will greatly benefit from the reductions in trade barriers, allowing for a more seamless movement of goods in the region.\n\nWe anticipate that greater transport connectivity will open up new cross-border routes that will ultimately create efficiencies and lower operational costs. Companies will be able to expand their market reach and to start doing business with customers across previously inaccessible markets. UPS stands ready to take advantage of these opportunities as Asean works towards liberalising the logistics industry, a move that will raise overall competitiveness across all industry sectors.\n\nNeeraj Swaroop\n\nChief Executive Officer, Singapore\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nASEAN is on a path of economic convergence. While this may be more of a journey than an end, the growth of investments and trade, an expanding middle class and burgeoning consumerism in the region have also led to the creation of wealth.\n\nMore importantly, at Standard Chartered, our role is to help our clients further their personal and business ambitions. A common market would present enormous opportunities for them to grow their wealth and business across Asean. We are well-positioned to help our clients tap these opportunities because we have a history of more than 150 years, close to 400 branches and over 30,000 staff dedicated to serving them in this region. We are also the only international bank to have a presence in all 10 Asean markets.\n\nRecently, we sharpened our focus via a bank-wide realignment to an eight-region geographical structure, of which Asean is one. This new structure gives special emphasis on the way we support and serve our clients and allows us to leverage the growing economic and commercial collaboration in the region. Singapore is central to the opportunities in Asean and we will continue to leverage it as a gateway to the region and wider Asia to facilitate trade and investment flows across our footprint of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTHE promised free flow of goods, services and people in an Asean Economic Community will open up unprecedented opportunities - and a ''steep learning curve'' - for businesses and the professional services industry. The ability to serve the varying needs of businesses - inbound, outbound and within Asean - seamlessly across geographies will be critical.\n\nTo that end, EY has integrated its practices worldwide, with Asean being one of its integrated operating regions since 2008. This enables us to tap a widened and more mobile talent pool to bring global experience and local knowledge together to serve the needs of clients.\n\nAs much as the AEC brings forth opportunities for collaboration, there will be heightened competition among businesses, amid continued complexities of navigating markets at varying levels of economic maturity.\n\nSuch is the vibrancy of the Asean region that the professional services industry must keep innovating itself, while its practitioners must have strong technical knowledge and expertise as well as a deep appreciation of regional, if not international, cultural and business norms and nuances in order to succeed.\n\nReto Brosi\n\nChief Executive\n\nAsia Capital Reinsurance Group Pte Ltd\n\nOVER time, the establishment of the AEC will open up new opportunities for everyone, with faster and more efficient access to new markets. Customer service can and will have to expand across multiple territories rather than just within the domestic market. There will also be an innovation boost due to the easier flow of new production and related technologies across countries within the region.\n\nFor the (re)insurance industry, the AEC will mean both a risk management opportunity as well as challenge. The opportunities to help clients adapt to new risks in the common market will pave the way for more innovative products and services covering multiple jurisdictions; at the same time, it also means that risk bearers will be more exposed to the dynamics of this greater interconnectedness.\n\nMultinational (re)insurers will have a head start in terms of innovation and managing the issues of cross border business. The more 'local' (re)insurers, however, have the advantage of strong domestic distribution access, which they must leverage strongly.\n\nMark Newman\n\nCEO\n\nING Commercial Banking Asia\n\nTHE Asean Economic Community has the potential to present the region as an attractive common market for foreign investments and business opportunities. ING Bank is positive about the economic upsides that the community can bring.\n\nThat said, there can be lessons learnt from the European Union experience. The bottom line is that the AEC would benefit greatly by adopting a pragmatic approach based on Asean's current and envisioned market position.\n\nIn banking, the establishment of the AEC by 2015 would present an opportunity to have a united and stronger voice towards managing extraterritorial regulations from Europe and the US on the financial markets. Additionally, the banking industry would greatly welcome a common approach towards clearing services and trade reporting which will significantly reduce the cost of establishing multiple clearing houses in the 10 member-states.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nTHE setting up of the Asean Economic Community in 2015 holds great promises for Singapore. Ninety-six per cent of Asean CEOs who responded to the recent PwC 17th Annual Global CEO Survey expressed optimism of high growth in Asean. Asean is a natural market with a sizeable population of 600 million or 9 per cent of the world's population. As a single entity, the AEC will be the world's 8th largest economy.\n\nIn PwC, we have been providing high quality and seamless service to our clients who operate across the region. The formation of the AEC will present more opportunities for us to provide regional advice in the areas of tax, deals and consulting. PwC will continue to bring in the right resources and expertise to serve our clients across industries and the region. PwC is proud to join hands with others in the profession on a journey to shape Singapore into a regional accounting hub which has added importance with the formation of the AEC.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express (Singapore)\n\nREDUCTION in cross-border regulations, elimination of tariffs and freer movement of goods are just some of the benefits that the Asean Economic Community will bring in 2015. This will create a conducive environment for SMEs in Singapore to expand their footprints overseas.\n\nBeing a trusted logistics partner to SMEs for over 40 years, we have an acute understanding of their needs and have tailored our solutions to help them internationalise. Helping SMEs figure out complex cross-border shipping and trading regulations as well as moving their packages efficiently, effectively and safely via our established networks are some of the ways we are assisting SMEs to thrive in foreign markets. We have also introduced new payment methods targeted at helping SMEs do business with us.\n\nAs fast-growing countries such as Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia open up their economies in the wake of the AEC, they will be looking to leverage Singapore's technological maturity to scale up their high-value industries - including biomedical, aerospace and maritime. With intimate knowledge of these verticals and effective logistics support, we will enable our SMEs to become successful first movers and capture the most strategic opportunities in these sectors.\n\nWahab Yusoff\n\nVice-President, South Asia\n\nMcAfee (part of Intel Security)\n\nI AM very excited about the opportunities that come with an Asean Economic Community - both for businesses as well as for the positive economic impact on the lives of the people in the region.\n\nIf you look at the AEC blueprint, it is clear that a secure and connected information infrastructure is important for sustaining the region's economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nFor our industry, I expect the AEC to have a positive impact on cyber security, as member countries will be encouraged to share a cache of cyber security information as well as align their cyber education efforts.\n\nToday we are witnessing constantly evolving, complex cyber attacks and threats to our information technology that don't stop at geographic boarders and are multinational by nature.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to unite in the fight against cyber criminals as traditional island solutions like firewalls or standalone defences are no longer adequate.\n\nWith the McAfee Security Connected approach we are already implementing the next generation of security solutions that use cloud intelligence to safeguard businesses from advanced attacks. This tremendously speeds up the readiness and robustness of our clients' cyber defence.\n\nWe are already working closely with governments and the private sector across Asean as one of our fastest growing markets, and look forward to cooperating with our partners, especially in the public sector, to safeguard the information infrastructure required for the next phase of growth through the launch of the AEC.\n\nAdam Judd\n\nVice-President for APAC\n\nBrocade\n\nTHE high-tech sector will stand to benefit immensely from the AEC, particularly in the areas of human capital transfer, infrastructure expansion and capacity building. The effective development of cross-border infrastructure will be crucial to achieving the AEC and integrating industries such as telecommunications, energy and transport. As such, spending on IT projects is expected to increase exponentially across the region.\n\nAt Brocade, we are already working with service providers and governments to help evolve their communication networks, through software networking technology that can be easily integrated with the current infrastructure, so that they can meet the growing demands of data- and bandwidth-intensive applications in an increasingly distributed environment.\n\nJoshua Soh\n\nManaging Director for Singapore and Brunei\n\nCisco\n\nTHE AEC 2015 is set to transform the way countries in the region connect, collaborate and thrive. The regional economic integration will result in economic transformation, social innovation and community enablement for these Asean countries.\n\nIt is a great opportunity to share our combined knowledge so that our friends in the region can benefit from our experiences in the development cycle, allowing them to leapfrog into a future-ready country. Our experiences with tried and tested solutions that work in Asia and our regional network of partners will revolutionise Asean by providing the means with which businesses, governments, schools and people connect the unconnected.\n\nWith education and the Internet as the two great equalisers in life, a strong, ICT-trained workforce is critical to the success of the AEC 2015. We are excited that over the last 16 years, the Cisco Networking Academy programme has trained more than 4.8 million students across 8,500 academies in Asean.\n\nOver the next five years, we have committed to train more than 400,000 ICT professionals across the region. This foundation of skills and knowledge will take Asean to 2015 and beyond.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore & Malaysia\n\nGROUPING the economies of the 10 member-states of Asean into one Asean Economic Community should make the region very attractive and competitive on the international stage, which would increase business opportunities - and in turn create jobs. It's an exciting prospect for all businesses in the region, including recruiters such as Hays.\n\nBut in order to take advantage of this opportunity all organisations, from multinationals to small and medium-sized enterprises, need the right staff. That's why we've achieved the world-leading ISO 9001:2008 certification in recognition of a management system conforming to world-leading standards.\n\nIn a competitive global market, this gives AEC employers the opportunity to work with a recruiter with the world's best processes and practices - a rarity in South-east Asia.\n\nAfter all, with the right planning and the right people with the right skills in the right position, achieving world-class success is absolutely possible.\n\nToh Han Li\n\nChief Executive\n\nCompetition Commission of Singapore\n\nWITH the advent of the Asean Economic Community in 2015, we expect to see even more Singapore companies expanding their operations into the region to tap the additional growth opportunities afforded by the AEC. It is therefore important for companies to have the necessary assurances and protection when accessing these overseas markets as new entrants.\n\nTo this end, one of the pillars of Asean economic integration is to put in place national competition laws to ensure a level playing field for businesses operating in the region. The current Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership under negotiation is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of Asean member states and their FTA partners. When concluded, it will complement the AEC and covers non-tariff barriers such as impediments to market competition. This will further encourage trade and investment flows into and within the Asean region and create benefits for both consumers and businesses.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWITHIN the human capital space, the impact of the Asean Economic Community would result in a highly dynamic and interesting marketplace. Already businesses and organisations are having borderless interactions; the formation of the AEC will bring a positive impact to the way we do business here in Asia.\n\nFrom a talent perspective, such an initiative will open doors, thus creating a vibrant economy where talent is mobile, agile and available. This is particularly important in ensuring that we do not suffer from a brain drain and also in providing jobs and opportunities to the current and future workforce. This will also impact the way we recruit and retain our employees and how we drive our business.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nTHE AEC in 2015 will probably have a bigger impact on some business sectors compared to others. In the education, enrichment and family care services sector, there will also be opportunities for business development for the local providers to tap the potential demand of educational and enrichment services for the AEC marketplace.\n\nPotential is greatest in the developing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. There are already established links within Asean on early childhood education and services for families. This is mainly focused on the provision of educational and care services to young children and on empowering women and families on socio-economic issues.\n\nBusiness entrepreneurs in the education sector could leverage further on the existing links and networks with partners within AEC to take their business in the region to a higher level through innovative and creative programmes that these developing countries can adapt for their local markets.\n\nHtwo Holdings sees this as a potential target for our business growth outside China. We will study how we can be part of this new economic cooperation and make Asean a competitive economic region.\n\nAlan Leong\n\nVice-President for Asia Pacific\n\nSilver Peak\n\nTHE easing of regulation on goods, labour, services and capital is likely to attract more investment into South-east Asia as businesses continue to tap into the region for growth opportunities.\n\nAs companies expand across markets, there's a burgeoning need for better network coordination between local offices and their regional headquarters. In order for the Asean Economic Community to function as the powerhouse of South-east Asia, businesses must contend with the adverse effects of distance, network quality and capacity, all of which can slow down the transfer and accessibility of data, which can ultimately impact business productivity.\n\nAs the 10-member states join forces, organisations need to ensure that replication of data over greater distances, between cities and across countries are in place, especially in natural disaster-prone areas. In addition, it is crucial that all information shared across networks are protected and kept secure, both for regulatory and compliance reasons, and to maintain customer trust.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nI THINK the impact will be positive. While my company has successfully expanded into Asean countries, we have faced problems such as high import tax and product registration issues. We need to spend time and money for the same product to go through product registration in every country every year.\n\nWith the Asean Economic Community, we can look forward to the elimination of such hassles. Taxes will be removed and the procedures standardised. As we already have subsidiaries and markets in various Asean countries, my company is ready to take immediate advantage of the opportunities from the AEC. Now, we are just waiting.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE vision of the Asean Economic Community is commendable. Its ultimate effectiveness, however, boils down to its execution and how everything will be coordinated between all 10 member-states. Human resources development and capacity building is one of the areas that has been specifically singled out in the AEC blueprint so this should bode well for our industry. The removal of restrictions on trade of services between member-states will facilitate the free flow of services and I certainly welcome any such measures that will help smoothen the path for PrimeStaff's expansion into the region.\n\nOur recruitment division already helps clients fulfil job placements across the Asia Pacific from our base in Singapore and we have been in expansion mode this year, regardless of the AEC. If the AEC can facilitate the opening of new markets for us and accelerate cross-market opportunities, that would be wonderful.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nAS a store fixtures specialist supporting international retail brands in their growth initiatives, the establishment of the AEC is most welcomed. We have manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and a common market will allow output in Malaysia to be delivered at zero tariff within Asean countries, making production in Malaysia as competitive as, if not more so than, in China. Operating costs have always been one of the many crucial considerations for our clients when it comes to creating greater retail presence.\n\nThe AEC will potentially put Asean on a level playing field with the current two economic giants, China and India. The pull factors will increase, including rising GDP which will serve to attract more international retailers to expand aggressively in this region.\n\nWith the presence of a large pool of relatively untapped young talent in Asean, coupled with China re-calibrating herself towards consumerism and labour cost adjustments, we could be seeing more foreign direct investments in Asean compared to past periods. We are very much looking forward to the good news in 2015 as we continue to serve a plethora of diverse retail brands.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nAN Asean Economic Community as an economic bloc tied by commonalities of interests and geography opens doors for its members. The free flow of trade, goods, services and people across borders will strengthen the community as a whole. This is particularly so for Singapore as among the Asean nations we are the smallest and poorest with natural and human resources. Singapore thrives by sheer tenacity, imagination and innovativeness in creating opportunities for itself. We became a centre for financial activities and transhipment.\n\nPeopleWorldwide aims to build a database of human talent in the Asean community by identifying and connecting these human assets to opportunities through Web and mobile technologies. We hope to play a critical role as a gateway to talent and labour migration. We aim to build a big databank of such talent and connect them to business opportunities, and help to build a better future for them.\n\nBy gearing up our IT infrastructure, PeopleWorldwide hopes to become the transhipment port for talent management and an effective gateway to talent and labour within the Asean community.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investors will earn an interest fixed at the rate of 3.5 per cent on the principal for these bonds. They are due 2026 but can be called for redemption in 2020.\n\nThis compares with the 11 per cent of insurance companies that took up UOB's first Basel III-compliant bonds. The issue, which raised $850 million for the bank, had nearly 75 per cent of the investment coming from private banking investors instead.\n\nTo be sure, some terms of the first bond issue are different - those are perpetual securities, which means they have no expiry date. Holders of that bond earn an interest of 4.9 per cent.\n\nStill, the change reflects that institutional investors are now more comfortable and aware of the non-viability loss absorption provisions contained in Basel III instruments, a banker said.\n\nUOB has been the most active among the three homegrown banks in issuing Basel III-compliant bonds. For a new instrument to qualify as bank capital under the Basel III framework, it must be able to absorb losses - either through write-downs or conversion into common equity - in the event the issuing bank hits a \"point of non-viability\".\n\n\"We have seen this shift as part of a global trend, in particular with the recent Basel III capital issues by Asian banks, where institutional participation has been strong,\" the banker said.\n\nUOB also priced the latest bond instrument - to qualify as Tier-2 capital - at 25 basis points tighter than the initial guidance of 3.75 per cent, the source said.\n\nThis comes on the back of Singapore banks' strong credit standing. UOB has also shown a \"disciplined approach to growth\", the banker said.\n\nAs a comparison, UOB's Basel II Tier-2 bonds, which are callable in 2017, are trading around 2.8 per cent. If adjusted for a three-year tenure extension to compare with the latest instrument callable in 2020, those \"old-style\" bonds would offer additional yield of up to 80 basis points.\n\nThis means the latest bonds were priced at little or no premium to comparative bonds trading now, and reflect competitive pricing, said Leong Hong Yew, UOB's head of capital management.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

VICTORIA HO reports\n\nPublished\n\nSun, May 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAS AN aerospace engineer in the 1970s, Philippe Forestier often had to work with wooden prototypes of planes on his drafting board. The simulation process was a long-drawn-out event, barely resembling what engineers can do today in a split second, thanks to 3D technology, says the executive VP of global affairs and communities with French 3D software giant Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. As one of the founding members of Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Mr Forestier has had the privilege of a front-row seat over the past three decades of 3D software's evolution.\n\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes was a subsidiary of the Dassault Group spun out in 1981 to develop the company's computer-aided design (CAD) software called CATIA. Short for computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application, CATIA started as an in-house project in 1977 to design fighter jets. Later, it won big-name clients like Boeing, which adopted CATIA in the 1980s as its main CAD tool.\n\nFrom the initial team of 10, today Dassault Syst\u00e8mes is 12,000-people strong, said Mr Forestier. The company had 2.1 billion euros (S$3.6 billion) in earnings in 2013, making it the largest French software publisher in terms of revenue. Its cash allows it to acquire, on average, one company per month. Its latest acquisitions point to new verticals that the company is eyeing, away from the aviation and manufacturing industry where it has already established a foothold, Mr Forestier revealed.\n\nThe life sciences, banking and retail verticals are particularly hot right now, and companies are incorporating 3D technology within their processes to gain an edge on the competition, he said. Last December, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes acquired Munich-based Realtime Technology AG (RTT), which produces marketing and branding-oriented 3D software for companies like Audi, Electrolux, General Motors and Harley-Davidson. Earlier this year, it acquired Accelerys, which made software for the chemical and life sciences industry. And in 2012, it bought Silicon Valley dotcom Netvibes, which made social media and Web-based applications.\n\nAll of these investments are aimed at extending the ability of 3D software to simulate as much of a business as possible - a process Dassault has dubbed the \"3D experience\". This involves simulating the building and management of materials of a product, all the way to the way the product is displayed in stores and how users will interact with the retail outlet, explained Mr Forestier.\n\n\"A good product by an engineer is not necessarily a good product in the consumer experience,\" he said.\n\nA car company five years ago would deploy Dassault's technology only for the development and engineering of new vehicles; today, many of the main players are simulating how a car would feel to a user.\n\nRTT, for example, produced software that would realistically simulate videos of cars and car parts. Many car advertisements are executed virtually, on software like RTT's, allowing them more dynamic footage otherwise not possible with real-life video, said Mr Forestier. \"They hardly use real cars for car advertisements now.\"\n\nFor retail, P&G is a Dassault customer that uses its software to design products from bottles to razors, to baby diapers. \"They design the bottle of the shampoo but they also place it on the shelf in a (virtual) context of a shop. The user interaction is tracked; the position of the item on the rack is not by chance,\" Mr Forestier said.\n\n\"When I started in the industry, the idea was to remove the need for the drafting table. Now (companies) do virtually everything from end-to-end, not just simulate the prototype.\"\n\nThe ability to get into the \"experience\" service opens the door for Dassault Syst\u00e8mes to sectors like banking and F&B, where the customer experience is often unique to the location, and companies operating within the industry are smaller than large MNCs. This will help Dassault penetrate South-east Asia, which remains largely untapped for the company, Mr Forestier said.\n\nFrance alone makes up 10 per cent of the 3D company's business, while the Asean region collectively makes up just 2 per cent, he said. About a third of its business is done in the US, and another third in Europe as a whole.\n\n\"We can do much more here,\" Mr Forestier admitted.\n\nThe company has offices in Singapore and Indonesia in Asean. Elsewhere in Asia, it has multiple offices in China, India, South Korea and Japan.\n\n\"We are not yet in Myanmar, or Laos or Cambodia, but those countries are interesting to us because of the GDP growth there,\" he said.\n\nIt plans to focus on the life sciences and energy sectors in the region, where most customers are trying to use 3D simulation to reduce waste. Mining companies are using data analytics to better narrow down where they can drill for resources, to reduce cost and the amount of trash generated, for example.\n\n\"We sell our systems to C-level people because they understand that they need to transform the business. We don't sell IT to IT people because they don't like adoption changes in the way they work,\" Mr Forestier noted.\n\nFor now, customers in the region are mostly interested in product lifecycle management software. Eventually, as these companies expand, Dassault hopes to push its \"customer experience\" software to them, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While the contract with Morgan Stanley is still valid, Ms Enriquez said the formal sale process stalled when the top bidder failed to obtain sufficient financing. \"What we're looking for is the best offer, and we're not in a rush to sell,\" Ms Enriquez said.\n\nKeeping the properties means Ara will forego a cash infusion at a time when the home-building industry is reeling from a shift in government housing policy.\n\nCompetitors Desarrolladora Homex SAB and Corp Geo SAB filed earlier this year for bankruptcy, known as concurso mercantil in Mexico, and Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB is working with Rothschild to consider options including restructuring debt.\n\nMs Enriquez said Ara is studying the possibility of selling the malls individually, because some bidders in the original auction had expressed interest only in specific assets.\n\nThe malls were valued at around five billion pesos (S$484 million), two people with knowledge of the properties said last year. CEO German Ahumada Russek had projected Ara would net at least 1.3 billion pesos from its portion of the shopping centres after paying associated debt.\n\nThe collapse of its competitors means Ara is the sector's biggest publicly traded company, with a market value of 7.6 billion pesos.\n\nMr Ahumada Russek also said on a conference call last month that Ara is bound by the conditions of a syndicated loan to withhold dividends during the repayment period, unless the malls are sold or a waiver is obtained.\n\nHomebuilder's cash balances plummeted last year and some companies wrote down land reserves after the government reallocated subsidies and financing for low-income homes to encourage city living instead of rural developments. The move was a reaction to urban sprawl and the subsequent exodus that had turned some subsidised developments into ghost towns, even as builders stockpiled more inexpensive farm land.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Its shares have risen for four straight days, with increased trading volumes in the last two.\n\nReuters and Wall Street Journal (WSJ), quoting unnamed sources, yesterday reported that KKR is nearing a deal to buy the Singapore packaging logistics company for at least US$1 billion.\n\nIn an update yesterday on its talks with various parties on a possible transaction, Goodpack said that \"matters have progressed\" since April 17 and that it was now continuing talks with one of the parties.\n\nWhile Goodpack had reportedly held meetings with two other private equity players Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group early last month, The Business Times understands that they had dropped out of the running.\n\nBut the run-up in the share price could imperil the KKR deal as well, given that minority shareholders could ask for a larger premium over an already increased share price.\n\nCapitaLand, which has launched a takeover for CapitaMalls Asia, has had to sweeten the deal by raising the offer price after minority shareholders and market watchers complained that it was too low; in another deal, Ong Beng Seng and Wheelock Properties also raised their offer price for shares in Hotel Properties Ltd after they bought shares in married trades at a higher price.\n\nThere is no certainty yet that a deal may happen, according to WSJ.\n\nGoodpack's shares have risen 22 per cent from S$2.03 since the firm first said on March 19 that it has been approached by unnamed parties which could lead to a general offer being made. The company has appointed Rippledot Capital Advisers as its financial adviser, and its founder David Lam - who owns 32 per cent of the firm - is said to be open towards a takeover offer.\n\nKKR set up its South- east Asia office in Singapore in October 2012, and the potential acquisition would mark its first deal here since then.\n\nGoodpack has, over the years, attracted various suitors.\n\nIn 2008, it hired Macquarie to look at strategic alternatives - from a sale to a strategic buyer to bringing in new investors. At that time, Australian packing companies Loscam and Brambles were reported to be interested in bidding for the firm.\n\nBrambles, which leases wooden pallets, reusable plastic containers and intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) to the fast-moving consumer goods industry, said on March 20 that while it has engaged in preliminary discussions with Goodpack on several previous occasions, including in the recent past, these did not progress.\n\nAnalysts attribute Goodpack's appeal to its strong position in a market niche and its global network which makes for a wide economic moat.\n\nGoodpack rents reusable IBCs to tyre manufacturers, chemical and juice producers such as Michelin, Bridgestone, BASF, Campbell and Heinz, for use in transporting their products, replacing the traditional wooden boxes and metal drums used in these industries.\n\nThe firm last Monday posted a 20.2 per cent increase in third-quarter net profit to US$13.1 million. Revenue rose 14.2 per cent to US$51.2 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also allows the company to seek new capital, including the sale of stakes to new investors. The company said on Friday it hoped to generate new revenue by finding partners interested in using areas it owns at the giant Port of Acu complex north of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRio de Janeiro-based OSX filed for bankruptcy protection in November as part of the unravelling of the once high-flying EBX Group of oil, electricity, port, shipbuilding and mining companies that Mr Batista assembled during an economic boom in Brazil that fizzled in 2011. The group has seen its value nearly evaporate in the last two years.\n\nDespite the plan's three-year grace period for repayment, OSX Brasil will set aside 25,000 reals (S$11,290) to be divided among all creditors within a year of the plan's approval. This will repay obligations to about half the individuals and companies owed money by OSX.\n\nAnother 80,000 reals will be paid within a year to creditors of OSX Brasil subsidiary OSX Construcao Naval. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

JAIME EE checks it out\n\nPublished\n\nSun, May 18, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNEW RESTAURANT\n\nShinji By Kanesaka\n\nThe St Regis Singapore\n\nLobby Floor\n\n29 Tanglin Road\n\nTel: 6884-8239\n\nOpen for lunch and dinner Mon to Sat: 12pm to 3pm; 6pm to 10.30pm\n\nSO who wasn't briefly annoyed with Barack Obama for not even finishing his food at Sushi Jiro in Tokyo - the subject of food porn documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Especially when lesser mortals try in vain to get a coveted seat at this supposedly seminal sushi-ya?\n\nYou wonder whether it's hype or skill that makes one chef's sushi taste better than another's. The 80-something sushi master Jiro has a son who has his own successful two-Michelin star joint in Tokyo, but it's still the old man's shop that people fight to get into. But doesn't it logically follow that if someone is taught by a master and has the same fish supplier, the sushi at both shops should be equally good?\n\nObviously, people don't agree, and therein lies the conundrum for master sushi chefs banking on this theory to expand their business.\n\nTake Shinji Kanesaka, the two-starred sushi chef who's spawned a string of restaurants in Tokyo and now Singapore. Is it possible to duplicate and export the same experience of eating sushi that he developed and which earned him his precious stars in the first place?\n\nTheoretically, you can reproduce the hardware - the one-piece hinoki counters, standardised recipes, make all your chefs shave their heads and use the same quality fish. You can even give your chefs the exact same training.\n\nBut the reality remains. It doesn't matter whose name is on the door. The taste of the sushi you eat is a product of the guy who made it, not the one who taught him.\n\nSo, you may be eating in Kanesaka's sushi restaurant in Singapore, but forget about eating the man's sushi per se. Once you get over that, you can settle down and gauge the food for what it is - high-end, high-priced, still-enjoyable experience at the hands of his personally picked chefs sent here to fly the flag.\n\nPeople were originally attracted to the first Shinji by Kanesaka in Raffles Hotel because of the Michelin connection, but it was still up to head chef Oshino Koichiro to build his own following. Now, at Kanesaka's newest offspring at the St Regis Singapore, head chef Kikuchi Shunsuke has been tasked to do the same.\n\nThe St Regis premises offers larger, more luxurious digs compared to its previous location within Chinese restaurant Tong Le at OUE Tower. And on the plus side, it's slightly easier (for now) to get a seat at St Regis than in the Raffles.\n\nIf you're looking for dependable sushi in an authentic setting, and psychologically prepared to pay at least $125 for lunch (12 pieces) and up to $450 for omakase at dinner, there's really little difference between the two.\n\nIngredients-wise, the quality is generally good with the occasional high, but there is no way to compete with the six-hour flight advantage that eating in Tokyo has. Nor can you compare the price, especially when you can get a top-of-the-line omakase by a three Michelin starred sushi chef for a little over $300. If you can get a booking in the first place.\n\nNonetheless, you can still get a decent Tokyo-style experience with crowd-pleasers such as silky-textured tofu paired with sweet uni, tender simmered abalone, seasonal firefly squid lightly marinated and if lucky, a choice morsel of engawa - the prized fin from hirame or flounder. Little tea lights fashioned from daikon slices add a lovely touch to the intricately arranged platter of appetisers (tsumami). Tender, melting-soft grilled nodokuro (black throat perch), crab meat blanketed with sheets of beancurd skin or yuba and uni paired with sweet baby shrimp are some highlights of its $450 set.\n\nWhile raw and cooked dishes are consistent, it's a different story when it comes to sushi. The $125 Tsuki course features 12 pieces of the usual suspects: hirame, a lovely golden eye snapper, horse mackerel, otoro and chutoro, uni, shrimp and anago. The rice is warm and chewy, but our sushi chef has an inconsistent hand with the wasabi, clearing our sinuses more often than necessary. And if you don't ask, he won't automatically tell you what you're eating when he hands you each piece.\n\nIn comparison, when the restaurant opened, Kanesaka-san himself made an appearance and we were able to compare two pieces made by him with that of his other chefs. The difference was clear - his was on a totally different level.\n\nBut why? The same rice and fish were used but in his hands, they came together in the right consistency, texture, temperature and flavour.\n\nCall it the heart, or even the spirit of the chef that goes into each piece of sushi that differentiates it from others, but maybe that's what Jiro's dreams of sushi are all about. You can't franchise a chef's personal touch. But take heart. You're not eating Kanesaka's sushi, but it's not that hard to get used to it.\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nFollow Jaime Ee on Twitter\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cathedral-height interior dwarfs the claustrophobic T1 and T2, built with concrete and one strip of skylight in 1985.\n\nThe glass structure is a bright spot of success amid other transportation projects and stadiums that remain unfinished. Construction has been delayed by cost overruns and even the death of workers. Brazil is also mired in protests and deadly clashes from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro as citizens show their opposition to what many consider misguided public spending on new arenas and infrastructure rather than education and social services.\n\n\"This seems to be the only success story,\" said Ricardo Gazetta, a sales manager at loyalty points company Multiplus SA in Sao Paulo. He was checking in for a flight to Porto, Portugal, on TAP SGPS on May 13. \"It looks like a serious building - it's huge, beautiful.\"\n\nBrazil has failed to deliver on 45 per cent of the infrastructure projects it promised to build when it won the right to host the championship in 2007, according to a study done by Portal da Copa 2014, a World Cup news website run by the national architecture and engineering union.\n\nThe terminal - built with sustainable engineering including water recycling and windows with heat filters - was finished on time and within the 2.9 billion real (S$1.63 billion) allotted budget, said Gustavo Figueiredo, chief operations officer of Terminal 3, in a telephone interview. About 8,000 people were employed and workers dug and drilled 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nGrupo Invepar, owned by the OAS SA construction company and government-associated pension funds, and Airports Co South Africa won the right to build the terminal and operate the airport when it was auctioned off in 2012 in the form of a 20-year contract.\n\n\"Operationally, it's been a success from day one,\" Mr Figueiredo said, citing the installation of scanners to get people through the gates, eliminating the need for employees. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

A clinic that wants to use a patient's personal data to market health products to him that are unrelated to his condition, for example, needs to tell the patient what the data will be used for and get his consent.\n\nThe guidelines for the education sector also clarify several issues, including the need to obtain a student's consent before disclosing his personal details to various parties. Schools which want to publish the names and photographs of top students and alumni in their marketing material should get these individuals' consent as well.\n\nThe social service guidelines, meanwhile, deal with how the personal data of a person who is receiving services from volunteer welfare organisations should be handled, among various things.\n\nThe PDPA exists alongside sector-specific laws - like the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act for healthcare, for instance. Where the PDPA conflicts with other written laws, the latter will supersede the former. Under the Infectious Diseases Act, for example, if a medical practitioner suspects that someone he is treating has an infectious disease, he is required to notify the director of medical services. In this case, the medical professional does not have to get the individual's consent to divulge this information.\n\nThe rules governing photography were also up for consultation from yesterday. Scenarios covered in the guidelines include whether an individual who voluntarily poses for a photograph is deemed to have given his consent for the photo-taking.\n\nConsultation on these guidelines will close on June 6 at noon.\n\nYesterday, the PDPC also clarified that, generally, the age of 13 is the minimum threshold for minors who can consent to the collection and handling of their data, unless the law specifies otherwise. As a rule of thumb, someone who is at least 13 years old would have \"sufficient understanding to be able to consent on his own behalf\", the PDPC reckoned.\n\nThe commission also shed more light on firms' obligation to provide individuals with access to their personal data that is kept on hand and the option to correct that data.\n\nAn organisation has to respond within 30 days when an individual makes such an access or correction request. If it is unable to do so, it must tell the person in writing the earliest possible time that it can respond.\n\nWhile the PDPC's stance is that a firm may charge a \"reasonable\" fee to recover the incremental costs of carrying out this obligation, it has not prescribed a benchmark fee at this point.\n\nAs July 2 looms, Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim announced a raft of measures to help firms adjust to the new rules yesterday.\n\nLater this month, two-day courses developed by the PDPC and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will be offered for employees involved in data protection matters. WDA funding ranging from 70-90 per cent of the course fee is available.\n\nIn August, a free e-learning programme that helps organisations to learn about their PDPA obligations will also be offered on the PDPC website. \"This gives organisations an additional resource to conduct self-directed learning to ensure compliance with the PDPA,\" Dr Yaacob said.\n\nEven after all that, if man and organisation still come to fisticuffs over personal data when the Act comes into full effect, both the Consumers' Association of Singapore and the Singapore Mediation Centre will be ready to provide mediation services for disputes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of that, 26 per cent spend a monthly average of $5.23 on their mobile gaming habits.\n\n\"We see the entire industry shifting from a small group of consumers to a very enlarged group of gamers,\" said Mr Cheong, head of FunLife, the digital content group for SingTel.\n\nDBS has created its own suite of games to achieve various outcomes. One of its games,WhyMoolah, is designed to creatively teach and reward players for good money management practices through simulation and stories. Another game, called Dragon Tap, is a virtual dragonboat rowing game that generates awareness for the DBS Marina Regatta 2014, a water sports festival.\n\n\"We look at the user being at the centre of our attention because we're looking more at acquisition these days and converting people other than just working with our customers,\" said Mr Ng.\n\nWhyMoolah has had over 25,000 downloads since its debut in November. This has helped DBS achieve its internal customer acquisition as well as engagement targets. It also allowed the bank to analyse real-time feedback generated from the players' behaviours to improve its games.\n\nHowever, when it comes to deciding how to measure the return on investment (ROI) of such gaming applications, Mr Ng said that it depends on what business objectives a company wishes to achieve. For example, Dragon Tap's purpose is merely to drive awareness of DBS' water sports festival, so there is no need for DBS to measure monetary outcomes.\n\nIt may be hard to quantify ROI but Mr Cheong advised companies to experiment with gamification as the gaming industry is, by nature, a hit-or-miss business.\n\n\"For every Candy Crush, there're another 10,000 games that got crushed . . . but the moment you get it, that kind of engagement and level of stickiness is quite amazing,\" he said.\n\nHe also stressed the need to create games that are easy to play yet good enough to retain gamers, saying: \"I think the whole make-or-break for gamification lies in two very critical components: One, it (the game) must be simple enough to attract users. Two, it must be sophisticated enough to retain the user once they get on board. At the end of the day, it's a balance between these two.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 16, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE could hardly reconcile the vision of Victoria Beckham, as she girlishly twirls a strand of her impeccably coiffed tresses while speaking in a clipped accent, with the bleached blonde, bulbous-breasted Posh Spice. The cleavage is still enviable, and tan a shade of deep mahogany, but the singer-turned-WAG-turned-fashion-mogul is the epitome of, well, actual poshness.\n\nThe 40-year-old stunner has been hushing critics ever since she unveiled her eponymous label six years ago through her refined and, in her words, \"deceptively simple\" designs. Earlier this month, she walked the red carpet of the Met Gala in a tiered column dress - a perfectly streamlined number she showed during a presentation at the Marina Bay Sands' ArtScience Museum last Saturday. Rather than resorting to over-the-top embellishments and second-skin silhouettes, the jet-setting mother of four obsesses instead on exquisitely finished pieces that fit into any smart wardrobe.\n\n\"To get such a stunning silhouette requires paying a lot of attention to the little details to enable a woman to put a dress on and feel so special,\" says Beckham, who was in town to launch her accessories line with designer accessories retailer On Pedder. \"They make you think about posture and how you carry yourself.\"\n\nAnd the ballet-trained businesswoman, who sits ramrod-straight throughout a group interview, is all about the finer points that make up the big picture.\n\n\"For me it's very important I work on my show and have six to eight minutes to put my message across with regard to my venue, clothes, hair and makeup, and the buyers come in and make their selection,\" says Beckham, who will be opening her first standalone boutique on London's Dover Street in September.\n\n\"With a standalone store I am making the buy for what I think my customer wants. My customer will come into my store and step into my world. I am a very visual person and pay a lot of attention to the ceiling details, the floors, the visuals. It's the first time the customer can see the brand through my eyes.\"\n\nWhile it is evident that Beckham is a seasoned pro at the PR game - she expertly lowers her chin and parts her lips ever so slightly for the camera, the former Spice Girl still comes across as personable and even down-to-earth, quizzing one reporter about whether she finds it easier dealing with her sons or daughters, and asking for beauty tips for tackling the humid weather.\n\n\"I think it's no different for me from any other working mum,\" says Beckham, whose youngest child Harper turns three this year.\n\n\"I get up quite early at six and that's when I do my workout and that's the time I have for me, and I am ready to take the children to school and I go to work. But I'm not going to sit here and say it's easy, any woman who works and is also a mum knows you feel guilty when you go to work, and I am not ashamed to say that.\"\n\nBeckham almost has you thinking she's like any other multi-tasking career woman, rather than an uber-celeb whose home back in London is going to be a $63 million seven-bedroom mansion in Kensington. Nevertheless, the svelte glamazon is quick to demonstrate that she is a realistic businesswoman who designs for real, albeit flushed, women - and not just her celebrity BFFs. She admits that while her dresses are expensive, she has to be realistic about the types of fabric she uses and the \"make cost\" involved when creating a collection.\n\n\"I don't think you always have to be wearing luxury,\" says Beckham, when asked whether Singaporeans' laidback style is less than chic. \"Casual is good, I lived in Los Angeles for six years and I loved every minute of it. It is more difficult to 'dress hot,' for sure.\"\n\nWhile the avid art collector has been inspired by a Julian Schnabel for the colour palette of her pre-Fall collection, her inspirations could sometimes be somewhat more pedestrian: \"One season, I saw my kid Romeo running into the kitchen in his baseball shirt and I was like, that's really cool. And I had a baseball thing, it was very subtle, that was running through the collection.\"\n\nFamily life, she insists, is her top priority even amid a busy schedule, which includes opening a New York office earlier this year.\n\n\"My proudest achievements are my children. They are a lot of work, but they're so very cute,\" gushes Beckham.\n\n\"I want my children to be happy. They are very sporty and they love fashion as well.

On the back of that, he has taken a huge short position on the NYSE-listed shares of the multi-level marketing firm.\n\nThat's not the only pressure the nutrition firm, with a market value of US$6 billion and run from Los Angeles, is under. Spurred by Mr Ackman's claims, the US Federal Trade Commission is looking into the firm's practices.\n\nOperationally, though, the firm is on steady ground. Its top line grew 18 per cent in 2013 to record sales of US$4.8 billion, an accomplishment that Mr Walsh is understandably only too eager to emphasise.\n\n\"Think about it. How many companies can withstand months of an orchestrated, blistering, weekly campaign of negative information and yet still have a stronger business with more customers than ever before,\" says Mr Walsh in an interview with The Business Times.\n\nHerbalife earned less in the first quarter this year due to foreign exchange losses but it still beat street estimates, encouraging analysts to raise their 2014 earnings projections.\n\nThis, says Mr Walsh, is proof of the legitimacy of the 34-year- old firm's business.\n\n\"We don't think he (Mr Ackman) has an interest in hearing or telling the truth. Remember, when you have a billion-dollar bet, it is not in your interest to have any information that you believe would be contrary to that,\" says Mr Walsh, who is in Singapore to launch a new product and hook up with distributors, his key mandate as the firm's president.\n\nBut the showdown with Mr Ackman, a shareholder class action against the firm and rife speculation that it is being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation have taken a toll on investor sentiment. The stock has lost 20 per cent of its value so far this year.\n\nStill, at current levels of around US$60-$62, it is nearly double the price it was trading at in December 2012, when the activist investor Mr Ackman first launched his tirade against Herbalife.\n\nThat is in no small part due to the firm's counter-offensive huge share buyback plan of up to US$1.5 billion and its healthy financial showing. Comfort has also come from heavyweight investors George Soros, Carl Icahn and Dan Loeb, to name a few, who have thrown their money behind the firm and scooped up its shares.\n\nMr Walsh says that the company is not aware of any FBI probe and has not been contacted by the federal investigators.\n\nThe company has set up a \"separate group\" within the firm to react and respond to the allegations. \"We will just have to see this whole thing play out and, meanwhile, we focus on our business,\" he says.\n\n\"It hasn't been terribly distracting as we recognise that the attacks have no legitimate basis. We knew that one of his (Mr Ackman's) objectives is to distract us and bring about an impact on the business. So we were determined not to let that happen.\"\n\nA sweet market for the nutritional products maker is right here in the Asia-Pacific, the firm's biggest growth spot which contributed one-fourth of total sales last year.\n\nA booming population, rising affluence and growing sense of well-being in this region stack up well for the firm's prospects.\n\nDriving the growth is the concept of nutrition clubs, a fit club or social gathering where, for a daily fee, one gets to consume a shake or tea and engage in some activity.\n\n\"We are encouraging all members operating these clubs to introduce some form of activity - get a shake, have a chat and go out and walk for 10-15 minutes.\n\n\"These clubs drive our products deeper into the community,\" he says, adding that this is one way Herbalife has managed to tap a younger consumer demographic.\n\nSingapore has 50 of these clubs out of the 17,000 scattered across the region and 55,000 around the world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But real estate is now expensive - which means a branch network is costlier at a time when regulations are raising costs for banks.\n\nMeanwhile, customers under 35 are the ones who tend to switch banks. And those in their 20s choose their banks based on their use of technology, he said.\n\n\"The location of branches has slipped down in factors of importance. The bigger banks that invest in technology are winning the war for switchers.\"\n\nThis comes amid the next wave of digital banking, as lenders strive to be more relevant to customers by aligning banking services with customers' evolving digital lifestyles, Neal Cross, chief innovation officer at DBS, told BT\n\n\"This sudden acceleration and focus on digital is the realisation that non-traditional competitors are moving into financial services and approaching it with the customer at the centre of what they do,\" he added.\n\nLenders in the West are already on the defensive, as non-banks try to make money off peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nOne such payment application is Venmo, which allows friends to send funds into each other's Venmo account, and creates a newsfeed of payment updates from friends. Venmo - which, like PayPal, is run by eBay - competes with apps such as Google Wallet.\n\nSingaporean start-up MatchMove has also hopped on the e-payment bandwagon, with a mobile virtual credit card that is targeted at the over 500 million \"uncarded\" smartphone users in emerging countries and at home.\n\nBut such technological disruption does not necessarily take business away from banks, said Mr Cross.\n\nMany start-ups still rely on card and banking infrastructure to operate, and the smarter banks will partner them to win their customers' favour, and provide a level of security.\n\nStill, banks need to overcome legacy issues and a heap of regulations, Hugh Mason, co-founder of Singapore-based accelerator JFDI, told BT.\n\nBanks' greatest challenge is that their current infrastructure is not as agile or as flexible as the payment technologies coming into the market today, said Paul Henaghan, managing director in Asia Pacific and Japan at ACI, a payment systems developer.\n\n\"The future of real-time money transfers is inevitable,\" he added.\n\nAsian banks have an advantage: they are still in \"build mode\" and may find it easier to relook their digital systems than Western lenders. They were also hit less badly by the global financial crisis, said Gary Turner, head of Bain & Company's financial services practice in Asia Pacific.\n\nLast week, OCBC made it possible for its customers to instantly send as much as $100 daily to any bank account in Singapore through a link via Facebook, a phone number or an e-mail address.\n\nCiting a 2011 study by Experian, OCBC said Singaporeans have the global distinction of spending the most time on Facebook, averaging 38 minutes and 46 seconds per session.\n\nAsia is not only leading in time consumption on mobile devices, the region's mobile users are also making effective recommendations of financial products and services to their friends, said Deepesh Trivedi, who heads Facebook's travel and financial services divisions in Southeast Asia, at the Next Bank Asia conference last week.\n\nThe conference, held in partnership with the 2014 Swift Innotribe Startup Challenge, seeks to connect the financial services industry with start-ups and innovators.\n\nBut a bank, like all businesses, has to calibrate its distance from customers: if it leans in too close, it risks irritating its clients; but if it stands afar, it cannot generate enough data.\n\n\"Why should a corporation know I'm going to be married, before I do?\" Aaron Fu, who is part of Standard Chartered's global digital banking team, said at the conference.\n\nHe pointed to the famous real-life example of a father who railed against Target for sending his teenage daughter coupons for baby products - only to find out later that she was indeed pregnant, as predicted by her buying patterns.\n\nMr Baxter has a personal frustration of a different kind: incessant offers of $5 pet-store vouchers.\n\n\"Can't you figure out that I don't buy anything to do with dogs? It's aggravating for customers. It shows that you don't know who I am.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Through our membership with Eurex Clearing, we can support our clients' trading needs by providing timely and reliable clearing services for transactions conducted on the Eurex Exchange during their regular business hours.\"\n\nAsia's share of global exchange-traded derivatives is 15 to 20 per cent - and growing, said the Futures Industry Association.\n\nUOB's brokerage arm, UOB Bullion and Futures (UOBBF), the largest Singapore-incorporated clearing brokerage on the Singapore Exchange, has been a trading member of Eurex Exchange since 2008.\n\nThe new clearing membership will therefore complement the derivative trading services that UOBBF provides on Eurex Exchange, said Mr Ong, who is also chairman of UOBBF.\n\n\"Our dual membership allows us to offer our clients one-stop broking and clearing solutions that provide lower associated risks and greater peace of mind.\"\n\nUOB hopes to corner a 5 per cent market share in clearing volume for Asian benchmark indices contracts on Eurex Exchange in two years.\n\nEurex Clearing's chief executive Thomas Book said that, for the clearing house, the development is \"an important step\" in extending its clearing capabilities into the Asian timezone and increasing its clearing footprint in Asia.\n\nFrankfurt-based Deutsche Borse which, besides Eurex also operates Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Luxembourg-based clearing house Clear-stream, has said it plans to open a clearing house in Singapore.\n\nThis will step up competition in the exchange space here; the US-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) Group just acquired the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and its clearing licence last November, and the Singapore Exchange (SGX), which owns AsiaClear, the world's largest clearer of iron ore swaps, is intent on growing its derivatives business.\n\nEurex Exchange has in recent weeks tied up with the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Bank of China as part of a long-term strategy to boost its business in Asia.\n\nIt has acquired a 5 per cent stake - the maximum allowed - in the Taiwan Futures Exchange (Taifex). Both exchanges will soon launch a trading link that will enable futures and options linked to Taiwan's benchmark Taiex stock index to be traded on the Frankfurt-based exchange.\n\nUOB said the clearing membership means it is well-placed to provide clearing services to domestic futures commission merchants in Taiwan who are keen to trade in the upcoming Eurex-Taiex link.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is despite two unsuccessful STCW (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) compliance audits by the European Maritime Safety Authority (EMSA) last year.\n\nA report by the independent oil tanker association, Intertanko, said that during a recent meeting of the Committee on the Safety of the Sea (COSS), EU members endorsed the recommendation from the European Commission (EC) not to derecognise Filipino seafarer certificates of competency. Instead, the Philippines has been given more time to address all deficiencies uncovered by the EMSA audits.\n\nBased on the EU timetable, the Philippines will have to provide by end-July proof that all outstanding deficiencies have been resolved and that all requirements of the STCW convention have been fully implemented. The Philippine report will then be verified by an EMSA audit team which will fly to the Philippines in October.\n\n\"Failure to resolve any remaining issue may result in the loss of EU recognition,\" the EU said. The EU, through its attached agency EMSA, regularly audits the maritime training and certification systems of countries supplying crew to EU-flagged ships.\n\nSeafarers from countries which fail the audit are normally blacklisted from EU vessels. The last country to have suffered this fate was Georgia when the EU withdrew recognition of its crew certificates in November 2010 because of issues on forged certificates and failure of the administration to monitor maritime schools.\n\nIn the case of the Philippines, however, the EU appears to have been more circumspect. The EU has had to contend with the fact that Filipinos make up a major portion of officers in EU ships and banning them could have serious consequences for European shipowners.\n\nEstimates place the number of Filipino officers employed on EU commercial vessels at around 14,000 and European shipowners fear that this could lead to an officer shortage and seriously affect their ability to safely operate their vessels.\n\n\"The most serious consequence of derecognition would be the loss of experienced (Filipino) officers from the industry,\" the Oslo-based Intertanko pointed out in a recent report.\n\n\"Many companies have taken the time and effort to train (Filipino) seafarers in their systems . . . and the industry would lose well-trained, competent officers who would need to be replaced with less-experienced ones. A safety impact could well be expected in addition to an inability to meet the requirements of the crewing matrix,\" the association explained.\n\nThe backtracking by Brussels on its threat to derecognise Philippine STCW certificates appears to have also been influenced by strong representations by the Philippine government. Desperate to forestall a ban on its seafarers, the Philippines dispatched in March a high-level delegation to Brussels to lobby the EC to grant it a one-year extension on the looming blacklist of its seafarers.Philippine maritime administration officials argued that an extension will give the country time to fine-tune reforms it recently put in place.\n\nThe officials reasoned that reforms such as a National Quality Standard System, a new syllabi for management level courses and naming the Maritime Industry Authority Authority as the single administrative body overseeing the implementation of STCW standards in maritime training and certification were only implemented over the past year and needed time to work.\n\nOfficials, however, admitted that while the system and infrastructure were in place the main stumbling block to compliance was the lack of qualified technical people to assess and monitor maritime schools.\n\nPhilippine Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya told the EU, \"We are hoping and praying that the EU sees the resolve and commitment of this administration to comply with the STCW convention and continue to look after the welfare of our seafarers.\"\n\nTaking into account the dangers an outright ban could cause to European shipowners and recognising the serious efforts made by the Philippines, the EU has given the country a six-month reprieve to address all outstanding issues. Filipino officers will, in the meantime, keep their jobs. To further ensure that the Philippines complies with the required standards, the EU is also sending technical experts to help out.\n\n\"It appears that the Philippine authorities have made appreciated efforts to bring their system in line with the requirements of the STCW. However, there are still concerns and the Philippine authorities need to demonstrate that the audit plans in place are actually being carried out and that they have all the necessary technically qualified human resources to monitor the numerous maritime education and training institutions operating in the Philippines,\" the European Commission's Directorate General for Mobility and Transport said in a report presented during the same meeting.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished Fri, May 16, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLESS than two years after it was introduced here, the Nissan Elgrand receives a major facelift that takes it higher up the premium scale. But it is not the updated exterior styling of this large MPV that makes the biggest impression. Rather, it is the new and overtly luxurious cabin, something that may help it to stand out in a market long dominated by the Vellfire and Alphard models from Toyota.\n\nFor model year 2014, Nissan Elgrand gets LED front and tail lamps, a new nose with a bigger and more imposing grille, plus a set of new 18-inch alloy rims. It also has what is internally referred to as a \"super luxury trim\", with all the bells and whistles that wealthier families who like this kind of car prefer. When it was first unveiled here, the Elgrand was a relatively basic eight-seater MPV. Authorised distributor Tan Chong Motor Sales still offers this variant, but now there is also a more upmarket seven-seat alternative.\n\nThe latter, which costs an extra $8,000, has opulent seats, including the centre row's pair of eight-way adjustable captain seats with ottoman feature. All seven are upholstered in the same factory-fitted diamond-patterned leather with contrast stitching.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Rahul Gandhi, who led the Congress party campaign, conceded defeat with his bloc leading in only 59 seats - the worst ever for a party that has governed India the most since Independence in 1947. Smaller regional parties were ahead in 149 seats, said NDTV station..\n\n\"The people have given me a clear mandate,\" Mr Modi, 63, told a rally yesterday in his constituency in Gujarat, the state he has run since 2001. \"No matter how many people have opposed me, I will bring them with me on the road to progress.\"\n\nThe landslide win for Mr Modi's BJP has created euphoria in India's financial markets, driving shares to record highs and the rupee to its strongest level against the dollar in 11 months. After a decade in opposition, the BJP has promised to repair an economy growing at its weakest rate since the 1980s and tackle stubbornly high inflation.\n\nMr Modi's government will face its first credibility test with markets when it delivers a Budget by July that must convince investors that India can realistically contain its fiscal deficit.\n\nTo meet a deficit target of 4.6 per cent of GDP for the year that ended in March, the outgoing government cut spending by US$13 billion and pushed about US$16 billion in subsidy costs into the new year.\n\nThat austerity could prove hard to sustain. Spending accounts for 11 per cent of GDP, offering a critical growth lever. Continuing to defer payments to state-run companies that would compensate them for selling fuel, fertiliser and food below market prices can create havoc with their finances and make them rely on borrowing to fund operations. The new government also needs to urgently narrow the current account deficit. A sharp narrowing of the deficit - to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2013/14 from a record high of 4.8 per cent the previous year - was helped by steps to curb gold imports.\n\nHigher duties and other restrictions almost halved gold imports, but the moves have been deeply unpopular. Gold smuggling surged after the measures, casting doubt on reported data. The BJP promised to review gold import duties within three months of coming to power. It may please gold buyers but not investors, as concerns about the current account deficit sent the rupee to a record low last August.\n\nThe Modi government also faces a factor beyond its control: the El Nino weather pattern, typically associated with weak rains. Analysts say El Nino could batter India's farm output. Citigroup estimates that below-average rainfall in the June-September monsoon could shave 0.5-0.9 percentage point off its economic growth forecast and lead to a spike in inflation. Surging prices could spark tension with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan who has made containing inflation a priority.\n\nThe central bank wants to bring down consumer price inflation to around 6 per cent from the current 8.6 per cent by January 2016, which would probably mean more interest rate increases. It has raised rates three times since last September.\n\nMarket expectations of Mr Modi are based largely on perceptions of his track record as chief minister in Gujarat, where he is widely credited with attracting investment. However, analysts say replicating that nationwide will be difficult, given that states wield much of the power in approving projects. Credit Suisse estimates that only a quarter of pending projects depend on central government approval.\n\nIndia also needs to address a US$100 billion pile of bad loans at its state-run lenders - about 10 per cent of all loans. Fitch Ratings expects stressed assets to reach 14 per cent of loans by March 2015. The bulk of these bad loans are related to infrastructure projects, which have made banks circumspect in lending.

It is important to know all these factors beforehand,\" he says. Style is not a priority for the winner in Best in Show and Gold Award at the Gardening World Cup Flower Shows 2012 and 2013, held in Japan, simply because, \"style will not last. A practical garden that makes you feel good and lasts longer is more important\".\n\nBased in Nagasaki, Mr Yamaguchi is participating in the landscape category at this year's Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) happening from Aug 16-24 at Gardens by the Bay. This is his first time participating in an overseas garden show.\n\n\"For this garden, it is hard, but I will do my best,\" he says with a laugh.

And for Singapore companies there, the ongoing unrest adds another layer of concern to an economy already plagued by several challenges, despite once being deemed a bright market for local firms.\n\nThe spreading troubles saw over 20 people killed as rioters set Vietnam's biggest steel plant ablaze overnight, according to Reuters. The mill was owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group, and was poised to be South-east Asia's largest steel plant when completed in 2020.\n\nThe escalation of violence in Ha Tinh comes a day after angry mobs - enraged by China's recent deployment of an oil rig in disputed waters - overran industrial zones in the southern province of Binh Duong. Rioters in the south - purportedly 19,000 in number - were said to have targeted Chinese companies and employees, but ended up looting and setting fire to Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kong properties as well.

And even more to dig into your past, to examine how you handled people and situations in your life.\n\nBecause we all think the same thing - it gives the other party the leverage to cross-examine you, judge you, and maybe even question if you are a decent human being. Now imagine the courage you'd need to do this on a stage, in front of a crowd of 200-odd people, multiple times in one weekend. So hats off to local theatre actress Oon Shu An, whose confessional one-woman show staged last weekend, #UnicornMoment, also marked her stage-writing debut .\n\nHer play was part of the Esplanade's Studio season, where she worked under the direction of Checkpoint Theatre's Huzir Sulaiman and Shiv Tandan.\n\nAlthough the actual performance only took place at the Esplanade Theatre Studio over three days, #UnicornMoment had already started a few months ago on YouTube.\n\nVia the actress' own YouTube channel, Oon uploaded weekly video podcasts of herself discussing some of the issues that most young people face nowadays. These included grievances with the education system, the link between perceived beauty and self-esteem, and facing fears. Most of these issues were revisited again during the course of the show, plus a few new ones like falling out with friends and loss of loved ones, all told through various skits and multimedia projections. Highlights included a banter with the actress's boyfriend, whose responses to her insecurities was a repetitive but endearing \"Do you need a hug?\", and a comical impression of her mother that drew sheepish laughter from the audience.\n\nAll this was set against a deceivingly simple-looking set of seven different-sized refrigerators, which was creatively used to house props and light effects.\n\nUnfortunately, some parts of the play did look a little like Oon was merely revisiting teenage angst, and a couple of sketches felt too long-winded such that the point was lost in thick chunks of dialogue.\n\nBut thankfully, Oon's natural charisma and engaging personality was an effective counter, as she valiantly held the audience's attention and had them laughing and crying at all the right places for most of 75 minutes.\n\nOn a whole, #Unicornmoment was an undoubtedly honest dose of good entertainment, that despite its shortcomings remained a commendable debut by a young writer, who managed to effectively harvest her own life experiences to give audiences something to chew on.\n\nIt may not be a piece of work by the next William Shakespeare, but this reviewer will definitely be keeping a lookout for what Oon has in store for her next original production.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Meanwhile, the Singapore representation in Penang's George Town Festival, under the sophomore outing, Sin-Pen Colony, will put up a well-rounded showing in Penang in August, reports CHEAH UI-HOON\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHIS year, it's the Malaysian artists turn to woo audiences here and the multidisciplinary line-up includes four unique performances - from stand-up comedy to a choreographed martial arts-based dance. Here, the Malaysian artists share how their shows will help cement ties between the two countries.\n\nHarith Iskandar: Godfather of Malaysian Comedy\n\n(June 18, NTUC Auditorium)\n\nAFTER more than 20 years in the rib-tickling business, there's no denying that the inimitable Harith Iskandar is the Godfather of Malaysian stand-up comedy. Despite his larger than life reputation, Harith has done only some five to six shows in Singapore. He really does love performing here, \"because I find the audiences are really ready to laugh. A particular memory I hold dear was from the show I did at the Kings and Queen of Comedy show where there was a woman in the front row dressed as a Smurf. Singaporeans rock!\" he says.\n\nA comedian is nothing without his or her audience, Harith insists, and the beauty of stand-up comedy is that there's stuff that'll happen spontaneously on stage, and only for that night. Broadly, he's taking the audience on his career journey from the time he started with only six for an audience at a hotel lobby, but who knows what trips and turns he'll bring them on, as he gives himself over to the vibes of the live audience. Just how much is Harish looking forward to his stint here? \"I'm peeing in my pants so much that my two-year-old son just handed me his pampers. THAT'S how much,\" he quips. Two young and upcoming Singapore comedians, Rishi Budhrani and Jinx Yeo, will open the show.\n\nWushu Madness II: The Realm Between by Lee Wushu Arts Theatre\n\nJune 19 at Chambers@The Arts House\n\nTHERE isn't a reason why martial arts can't be combined with performance, and it's with that conviction that one of Malaysia's national Wushu practitioners, Lee Swee Seng, decided to set up the country's first group merging the two in the late 1990s. While Lee Wushu has performed in Singapore before, this is the first time it'll be presenting a full length production here. \"Wushu is a competition sport and exercise, but I realised that there can be more to it, and that it can also be a performance. After all, it's not uncommon to incorporate martial arts moves into dance,\" he says.\n\nExcept that his students are trained in actual wushu, so there's real energy and spirit in their moves - more than if they were just movements or a series of self-defence techniques. Even as the shared culture between Malaysia and Singapore is being reduced as the years go by, but the overseas Chinese (Nanyang) culture is still a common historical and cultural ground, notes Lee. \"We should be celebrating more of our shared ground, and this Nanyang culture between the two countries,\" he highlights.\n\nLee Wushu has toured its full-length productions in the UK, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Indonesia, and Wushu Madness II: The Realm Between is inspired by the philosophical piece Dream Butterfly by Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zi.\n\nAbout Last Night by Cempaka Performing Arts Company, Cempaka International School\n\nJune 20-22, Aliwal Arts Centre\n\nThe play is written and directed by Scott McQuaid, who teaches drama at the Cempaka International School. This is an original one-act comedy, character-driven with the story opening with two strangers waking up next to each other with no recollection of the previous night. Then as the story unfolds, clues arise. The play made its debut only in January, and earned rave reviews from the Malaysian press.\n\n\"This comedy play works on several levels, and it has a multiracial Malaysian cast that brings different dynamics to the characters they portray,\" explains McQuaid. \"But the content of the play is very Western and has that dry wit that is seen in British BBC comedies.\"\n\nWhile the play is light, he adds, it does show a more liberal side to Malaysia and this would probably surprise Singapore audiences.\n\nPost Traumatic Shopping & Not Even the Night has such Gentle Hands by theatrethreesixty\n\nJune 13-15 at Play Den @ The Arts House\n\nChristopher Ling has presented work under the CEX banner (Food, Sex & Death staged in The Arts House in 2011) but this is theatrethreesixty's debut performance in Singapore. The two plays focus a great deal on the actor and his/her craft, and the nature of storytelling is elevated and given a higher sense of importance, explains Ling. Part of the reason is because he has to keep production costs low.\n\n\"What makes the work truly 'Malaysian' is its heart and soul. The Singaporean sensibility is not that far removed from that of the Malaysian. As such, I feel there is much to savour and enjoy when experiencing the work,\" he adds. Post Traumatic Shopping by Nandang Abdul Rahman was inspired by actual events, and Singapore playwright Desmond Sim wrote Not Even the Night.\n\nNever Eat Too Much Before Rapture (NETMBR) by SIFU Theatre Productions\n\nJune 20-22 at the Living Room @ The Arts House\n\nConsisting of nine actors, the ensemble will perform 35 plays in 70 minutes. Says the founder of the group, Freddy Tan. All the scripts are written by the Malaysian cast, with a strong focus on honesty and awareness of themselves. \"Some pieces have actually been written in different languages and dialects; and we also have some which will be improvised on. It keeps the show fresh and also guarantees a different show every time.\"\n\nThe audience actually decides the order of the plays, and the ensemble also decided that the plays will remain as they are, and not be adapted to Singapore. \"Some pieces may be comedic, some may be sad, and some may even change the course of the show. All the plays will be performed from a perspective of absolute honesty,\" says Tan.\n\nThe pieces won't be akin to sketch comedy, but will present real-life observations. \"But we also rely on the audience to keep the show going as they will be tasked with calling out the next piece they want performed. This keeps the actors organic, the audience engaged, and lends to a different show every time,\" explains Tan.\n\nThe format for NETMBR was inspired by the Neo-Futurists Theatre Collective based in Chicago and New York, with the ensemble keen to find out if a high-tempo theatre experience like this would appeal to the local audience.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCauseway Exchange, the Singapore-Malaysia arts festival, will be held in Singapore from June 13-22..

This amounted to a non-recurring, non-cash adjustment loss of US$6.1 million and finance costs of US$5.9 million. The bonds were originally due in July 2016,\n\nRevenue in Q1 rose 5.5 per cent to US$21.2 million.

Routes such as East Asia and the Pacific saw a slight increase in load factor as traffic growth outpaced that of capacity growth. However, West Asia recorded a drop of 3.1 percentage points in PLF to 67.4 per cent.\n\nCargo traffic (measured in freight tonne kilometres) for SIA Cargo was weaker partly due to the Easter period, with load factor declining on nearly all routes except West Asia & Africa and Europe. Cargo traffic fell 6.7 per cent while capacity slipped 4.9 per cent. This caused load factor to drop 1.1 percentage points to 61.7 per cent. The counter closed at $10.25 yesterday, up one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are set to play their first -ever headlining show here next week; with Singapore being their only South-east Asian stop on their current world tour.\n\nTo date, the pair has sold out major venues such as Madison Square Garden in New York; played at major events such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace; and even performed on the hit TV musical Glee. All 11 shows on their tour of Japan in March earlier this year were completely sold-out.\n\nFrom the songs 2Cellos have covered on their albums - everything from U2, Guns N' Roses, Coldplay, Nirvana to Muse - it's hard to imagine both Sulic and Hauser are actually classically trained musicians and not natural born headbangers.\n\n\"We dedicated our lives to cello and classical music but at the same time, there was always a rock animal inside of us that wanted to explode,\" explains Hauser. \"And we just found the perfect solution to combine all the music that we like, and are passionate about; this is how project 2Cellos began!\"\n\nTheir self-titled 2011 debut hit the No 1 spot on the US Billboard Top Classical Albums chart upon its release and was praised by critics for its unique arrangements of popular tunes. Their follow-up from last year, In2ition, went a step further with the twosome collaborating with big names such as legendary rock guitarist Steve Vai and classical piano superstar Lang Lang.\n\n\"In the future, we would love to collaborate with people like Sting (and) tour with some bad-a** rock bands such as AC/DC!\" reveals Hauser, when asked about 2Cellos' upcoming plans. Incidentally, the duo's latest music video is a cover of AC/DC's stomping anthem, Thunderstruck. The clip has close to 18 million hits so far since they posted it in February.\n\nBut 2Cellos do not just stop at paying tribute to their favourite acts by covering them; they often collaborate with the stars on-stage too. Like when they not only opened for Elton John here in 2011 but also performed with him during his main set.\n\n\"Jamming with Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage was (another) evening we will never forget as we just met on stage for the first time and started improvising together,\" adds Hauser. \"It was so spontaneous and inspiring.\"\n\nHanging out with the bad boys of funk-rock must have also rubbed off a bit on the clean-cut duo because 2Cellos now are no stranger to \"bad\" behaviour themselves.\n\n\"We've destroyed an insane amount of bows and bow hair at our shows because we are very energetic and passionate when we play; I remember during the filming of a Glee episode, they brought us six bows for filming, and we destroyed all of them in just a few hours!\" reveals Hauser, when asked about the most outrageous rock star thing they have ever done. \"And once we jumped into the sea with our cellos!\n\n2Cellos will play The Star Theatre on May 22 at 8pm.

It's a welcome return to the big screen as the king of the kaiju (monsters) goes into battle with a pair of fellow beasts while cutting a destructive swathe through America's Pacific Coast.\n\nGojira, the 1954 Japanese original directed by Ishiro Honda, was created partly in response to the country's wartime experience, in particular the use of atomic bombs on its cities. Six decades on, the perils of nuclear proliferation remain a significant theme in Godzilla - even more so given the ongoing fallout from the Fukushima disaster of 2011.\n\nThe new movie, the latest in a long line of Godzilla sequels and remakes, is directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Max Borenstein from a story by David Callaham. It's a respectful reboot and stays true to the spirit of its Japanese origins while forging a 21st-century identity of its own - a US$160-million budget can do that for you.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The volume of deals is drying up. And developers are pulling back, furloughing workers and delaying new projects.\n\nIn the latest sign, housing starts plummeted 25 per cent in April from a year ago, the Chinese government announced on Tuesday.\n\nIt is a severe blow for a country where real estate sales offices have become ubiquitous and tower cranes are jokingly described as the national bird.\n\nSu Hua, a real estate broker in Shenzhen, had his highest commissions ever last year, as a speculative frenzy prompted families all over China to buy and sell apartments at a brisk pace. But he sat in a deserted office late last week with several silent phones on his desk. His income has halved so far this year.\n\nThe question is how much further the real estate market will slow, and whether its troubles will spill into other sectors of the economy, notably the banking system. Any weakness in the great Chinese economic engine could reverberate through the global markets.\n\n\"You can't predict how the bursting of a Chinese real estate bubble plays out because it plays out in very small steps,\" said Joel Rothstein, a partner in the Beijing office of the Paul Hastings law firm, which specialises in Asian real estate.\n\nChina's real estate market correction - some economists are even calling it the popping of a bubble - is partly the result of a deliberate decision by the country's leaders in Beijing.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other regulators in the United States did not try to deflate what now seems to have been a US housing bubble in the years leading up to the 2008 downturn. But the Chinese leadership has been increasingly concerned over the last several years that housing prices were rising to unaffordable levels and that the economy was becoming overly dependent on investment; residential construction accounts for one-ninth of all economic output.\n\nThe result has been a series of policies that includes punitive interest rates for mortgages on second homes, a ban on the purchase of third homes and, more recently, deliberate action by the central bank to keep short-term interest rates well above the rate of inflation.\n\nZhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, the People's Bank of China, reaffirmed tight credit policies on Saturday, saying that he did not think the economy was in sufficient trouble to justify monetary policy stimulus.\n\nBut the real estate market continues to slump, which could prompt Beijing to take a different tack.\n\nEconomic data released on Tuesday also included a deceleration in industrial production, with growth in steel and cement output slowing to a crawl. Retail sales also grew more slowly than expected in April, and the furniture market stalled as fewer families moved into new homes. According to Centaline, one of China's largest real estate brokerage firms, transactions over the May 1 holiday weekend fell by half in Beijing and Shanghai from a year ago. The weekend is traditionally one of the two biggest real estate buying times of the year, along with a week-long national holiday at the start of October.\n\nMr Su, the real estate broker, worries that the market tumult shows no sign of ending.\n\n\"There is not much else I know how to do,\" Mr Su said. \"Maybe I will consider selling insurance on the side, if business continues to slow.\"\n\nA handful of real estate restrictions are already being rescinded. In the last two weeks, state-controlled banks in Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, have stopped charging the extra 0.5-1 percentage point above the regulated national benchmark rate for mortgages. They had been charging extra in recent years, in an effort to discourage excess in the market.\n\nBut some experts wonder whether wealthy families will want to jump back into the market even if the most important restrictions, on the purchase of multiple apartments, are lifted.\n\nNicole Wong, the head of property research at CLSA, a Hong Kong-based brokerage and investment firm, said that easing limits on overseas investment meant that more wealthy families were starting to send their money to Hong Kong and elsewhere instead of buying more apartments.\n\nFor real estate prices, \"even if you relax all the restrictions, it won't make much of a difference\", she said. \"The one thing that is certain is the direction is set, and it is down - but it can be managed.\"\n\nChinese banking executives and economists say that a severe housing downturn would most likely cause a considerable increase in non-performing loans at the country's banks. But they make several arguments for why even a fairly steep slump in housing might not lead to the bank failures or emergency bailouts seen in the US when its market soured.\n\nA major reason is that a significant drop in the housing market would still leave the prices of most homes higher than the balance on the mortgages. So almost nobody expects a big wave of foreclosures.\n\nThe bulk of the homes in China were bought more than five years ago, and real estate prices have about doubled in the last five years. Downpayments range from 20 to 40 per cent and are often higher, giving banks a larger cushion against any losses.\n\nA bigger worry is the extent to which companies in other sectors have borrowed money from banks and trusts that they were supposed to invest in equipment purchases and other business activities, but have secretly speculated in real estate instead. Extensive anecdotal evidence suggests that such speculative activity by companies has been widespread.\n\nOther sectors of the Chinese economy are healthier than residential real estate, and could help sustain economic output. Infrastructure spending by the government, particularly railroad construction, is moving into high gear. And the central bank has gradually pushed down the renminbi against the dollar in currency markets this year, helping the competitiveness of Chinese goods.\n\nBut the trouble in the housing market has serious implications for consumers. A national survey released in March by the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu found that households across the country had 66 per cent of their assets in their homes, a figure that rises to 84 per cent in Beijing. The comparable figure for the US, where stocks and bonds are more popular, is 41 per cent.\n\nWith so much wealth tied up in housing, concerns are rising about the potential for protests and other turbulence if real estate prices keep falling. A new crop of discounts adds to the nervousness.\n\nGovernment and private sector statistics for real estate prices are inconsistent and hard to compare. But discounts of 10-20 per cent from a year ago are increasingly common for homes sold between individuals, and for new units sold by developers as well, real estate executives said.\n\nThe chairman of a large developer with operations across China said that offering price discounts for the remaining units in half-sold projects was extremely difficult, because earlier buyers could protest and demand refunds equal to the discounts. The potential for protests, and not banking sector exposure to real estate, \"is what concerns me\", said the developer.\n\nBut Winnie Cheng, the research director at Centaline, said that many developers could not afford to hold apartments off the market indefinitely and were already cutting prices. Street protests have occurred, notably in Hangzhou, although earlier buyers have mostly accepted the discounts for later buyers, she said.\n\nThese days, she added, \"all of the developments are willing to cut their price\". - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Excluding this one-off reversal, net property income would have increased 4.5 per cent over the adjusted net property income a year ago.\n\nThe managers said growth in net property income was underpinned by improved performance of its hotels in Australia, which achieved higher occupancies and average room rates after the completion of a A$30 million (S$35 million) asset enhancement initiative in August 2013.\n\nAverage occupancy at its Australia hotels climbed 3.1 percentage points to 83.8 per cent, while the average daily rate rose 7.4 per cent to A$174.\n\nTan Juay Hiang, chief executive officer of the trust managers, said: \"We are pleased to see positive results from the asset refurbishment programme in Australia. We will maintain our focus on improving RevPAR (revenue per available room) of the hotels and increasing their competitiveness through effective asset management and enhancements.\"\n\nFor the full year, the trust posted DPU of 5.52 cents on gross revenue of $210.6 million and net property income of $82.9 million.\n\nAs the trust was officially listed only on July 27, 2012, the previous year's results are not comparable.\n\nThe trust's portfolio valuation stands at $1.41 billion following the acquisition of Osaka Hotel, its second property in Japan, last month.

The clincher was that the play had to be situated in a grand old mansion along a road once dubbed as \"Millionaire's Row\" because the rich of Penang had mansions in it.\n\nTan roped in Lim Yu Beng, her other thespian half, to write and direct the piece because he had the technical know-how and the interest. Lim's father was from Penang after all.\n\n\"I knew he had the technical foundations, temperament and know-how to enjoy the exchange on a level that I felt was needed for a play of this nature. Not everyone is interested, loves and enjoys Penang enough to devote the time and energy to the interviews and research necessary for a historical drama of this nature,\" says Tan.\n\n\"The opportunity to delve deeper into this side of himself - that in itself was a great opportunity for the exchange between the Singapore and Malaysian part of himself; to revisit your family and its roots in ways that you've never really spent the time doing,\" she cites. Lim interviewed descendants of some prominent families in Penang for the play which will revolve around the lives of 12 people after World War II, people who are linked to a sworn brotherhood of two migrants who arrived in Penang by boat from China in the 1800s, to make a new life for themselves in Malaya.\n\nThe pro-British Chinese have just declared Britain's commitment to Malaya when bombs fall hours later, on Dec 10, 1941, and devastate George Town. Through loss of love, life and dreams, they will be forced to make choices that will define themselves, and Malaya, and emerge as the new face of a nation after war. The setting is an early 20th-century mansion, built in 1919 by one of the early Penang millionaires Heah Swee Lee, a sugar baron. An active sportsman, he was one of the first non-European members of the Penang Polo Club and his sporting legacy continues today with the Heah Swee Lee Cup for lawn tennis. The mansion changed owners a couple of times, and was last bought by another tycoon, Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew, in 1973, and is now restored by the Bayview Group of the Boon Siew Group.\n\nLim says that rehearsals haven't begun yet, but the cast from both sides of the Causeway have been selected and they've done company readings. \"We just did a weekend Hokkien immersion trip with some of the actors, because the Hokkien in Penang is highly distinctive, and totally different from what we speak in the south,\" he says, adding the play is still evolving.\n\nAs Lim researched the very rich, English-speaking, Chinese of the colonial era, who were gentrified and pro-British, and ensconced in their own world of influence and power, fun and frivolity, the more he read into the common shared history of Penang and Singapore. \"Essentially, I created characters whom I felt were representative in some way, and turned them loose on one another in the same space. They practically wrote themselves, improvising in my head,\" he shares.\n\n\"I am often struck by Penang and how it's like Singapore, had we made different choices. I know some look at Singapore the same way. We were, in a sense, the two houses, cut from similar cloth, yet stitched together in a very different way. The rips and tears, the patching up, these ruptures and healings make us the states, and the human beings we are,\" he elaborates.\n\nIn Singapore, Lim is known more as an actor and lighting designer, so is playwriting a new role for him? \"Well, first of all I would venture to say that any time an actor creates or improvises, he is to a certain degree, playwriting. The same is true of a good designer, who is tuning into the director's wavelength and taking upon himself the responsibility of being a co-creator of the work. So, we are all 'playwriting' - finding ways to tell a story or communicate an idea,\" he replies.\n\nBut with this role, he has the first choice of what tale to tell. \"I had to listen to my heart and speak of what matters to me.\"\n\n2 Houses will be performed in Penang from Aug 28-31.

HanKore shares rose by $0.002 yesterday to close at 9.8 cents.\n\nOver at fibre membranes manufacturer Memstar Technology, third-quarter net profit fell by 93.1 per cent yesterday to 0.65 million yuan, from 9.43 million yuan last year.\n\nThe group, which had completed the sale of its principal and wholly owned subsidiary, Memstar Pte Ltd, to United Envirotech Ltd for S$293.4 million on April 11, is currently dormant.\n\nRevenue for its discontinued operations fell 19.9 per cent to 39.3 million yuan, due mainly to project delays resulting in the drop in membrane sales. Memstar shares fell by $0.001 yesterday to close at 1.5 cents.\n\nSingapore-based Moya Holdings Asia fared better than the other two companies. Its first-quarter net profit rose 15 per cent to $0.5 million, despite its revenue slumping 27 per cent to $5.4 million.\n\nMoya shares closed at 3.5 cents on Wednesday, when it last traded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In one video, a Hong Kong woman confesses she didn't enjoy sex until she started charging her husband money - HK$500 (S$80) per night, to be exact. In another video, two Israeli women talk about bondage. And in yet another video, a Japanese woman speaks candidly about her fetishes.\n\nThe videos are part of the exhibition by Hong Kong's leading non-profit art centre Para Site. Titled Ten Million Rooms of Yearning: Sex in Hong Kong, it is shown across five different venues in Hong Kong.\n\nDespite the ostensibly provocative subject matter, there are no signboards at the entrance warning visitors about what they're about to see, and no age restrictions for who's allowed to see them. Several teenagers were seen entering the spaces to experience the artworks, which range from humorous paintings to subtle photography to revealing videos, all exploring various aspects of sex and desire.\n\nLim Qinyi, a Singaporean curator who's been working with Para Site for the past two years, says: \"When people think of artworks about sex, they may automatically think there's nudity. But the artworks we're showing are not necessarily explicit. We're more interested in seeing how sex and desire are hidden, altered or replaced by factors such as Hong Kong's family structure and small living spaces.\"\n\nAccording to a Durex survey, Hong Kong denizens rank among the most sexually dissatisfied people in the world - along with Singaporeans. This exhibition examines sex, sexuality and sexual attitudes in the post-1997 years which witnessed a growing political and sexual conservatism in Hong Kong society.\n\nMs Lim worked in NUS Museum and Singapore Art Museum before being appointed as the first full-time curator of Para Site. Reflecting on whether such a similar exhibition on sex could be held in Singapore for all members of public, Ms Lim says: \"There is a serious discourse about art in Hong Kong that doesn't really exist in Singapore. There, much of the discourse is institutionalised. We've found that, with our past exhibitions in Hong Kong, when a subject is well-researched and presented, it would spark a healthy conversation about the subject.\"\n\nThe works on display include Hong Kong artist Chu Hing Wah's gently humorous painting about the city's leisure centres, Israel's Roee Rosen's provocative film about bondage, as well as Singapore photographer Nguan's poignant snapshots of lonely people in the Lion City.\n\nThe exhibition titled Ten Million Rooms of Yearning: Sex in Hong Kong is now on till Aug 10, at five different locations in Hong Kong.

Hence, many artists rely on generous patrons for survival. In the case of visual arts, artists typically sell their works to wealthy collectors who gradually become influential players in shaping the development of the local art scene.\n\nHaving tracked the region's scene for several years, independent art journalist Patricia Chen decided to capture some of these important collectors on film. Chen herself never dreamt of being a filmmaker. But after years of interviewing artists and art collectors for various publications, she found it to be an almost natural next step in her skills progression because \"there are things the camera does a better job in capturing,\" she says.\n\nAn excerpt of her upcoming documentary on legendary art collector Uli Sigg is premiering today at the Hong Kong Arts Centre, with a second film project about Indonesian collector Oei Hong Djien in the pipeline. The film premiere will also be accompanied by the launch of Chen's new book, Uli Sigg: In Conversation with Patricia Chen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Considering the iPreciation gallerist brought less than 30 works by Singapore artist Lee Wen to Art Basel Hong Kong, that's more than half of her stock sold or on reserve. And it is only the second day of the fair - there are three more days to go before the fair closes. \"I want to sell everything by the end of it,\" she says determinedly. \"It's not even for me - it's for Lee Wen.\"\n\nLee, 57, is one of Singapore's most important contemporary artists. He started practising performance art at a time when the Singapore government denied funding for any performance artist, following Josef Ng's controversial act of snipping his pubic hair in a 1993 performance. For more than 20 years, Lee struggled to gain recognition, selling very few works and living in abject conditions.\n\nLee's booth at Art Basel Hong Kong marks the first time that his works are being shown in a commercial solo exhibition. The brisk sale of the works validates Ms Chan's belief that \"it always takes the establishment 20 years to understand contemporary art and artists.

Fatca is the United States' effort to crack down on American tax cheats by harnessing the compliance of foreign banks as part of its tax policing network. All banks globally are required to report on the assets of clients deemed to be \"US persons\". The law is able to do this through onerous penalties: Institutions, including hedge funds, stock brokerages, banks, trusts and insurance companies, will have to impose a 30 per cent withholding tax on US transactions by clients who are non-compliant.\n\nTo date more than 50 countries have signed up to comply with Fatca through inter-governmental agreements, including major proponents of banking secrecy such as Switzerland. The notable holdouts have been Russia and China. Fatca was supposed to be in force from July 1 but the US government recently allowed yet more breathing space, designating 2014 and 2015 as a \"transition period\" where the US tax authority, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is to ascertain that \"good faith\" efforts have been made towards compliance. In any case, Singapore appears to be on track. It recently announced that it has concluded talks with the US to facilitate compliance with Fatca by Singapore financial institutions. Under their agreement, financial accounts held by US persons will be reported to the Singapore tax authority which will in turn convey the information to the IRS.\n\nTo be sure, opposition to Fatca is mounting, particularly among Americans living abroad whose access to banks and other businesses is already being curtailed. Over the last couple of years, numerous banks have refused to cater to Americans. But the tide may be irreversible. Already Fatca is serving as a framework for similar actions in the escalating crackdown against tax evasion. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently issued a report on a global standard for automatic exchange of tax information between countries, which also provides a model inter-governmental pact for countries similar to Fatca. Details to be shared include bank balances, dividends and interest income. Financial centres such as Switzerland and Singapore are signatories, along with some 50 other countries. This suggests that financial institutions will have to brace themselves for yet more compliance issues. While it may have been possible for foreign institutions to shun American accounts in response to Fatca, such a stand becomes unrealistic if the automatic information exchange that the OECD envisions becomes a global standard.\n\nAs a premier wealth management centre, Singapore has clearly signalled its stance against tax evasion. For financial institutions, however, the devil is in the details. While banks are not expected to ensure that clients are tax compliant, they are expected to be vigilant, conducting critical reviews of clients' accounts, for instance, for potential red flags such as the use of complex structures. Ultimately bank secrecy is being redefined; it is not to be misused by tax cheats.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Louvre bought the hotel InterContinental managed a few hundred metres from the seashore in the Sao Conrado neighbourhood in 2011.\n\n\"We want to return to Rio,\" Mr Smaletz said. \"The market is very attractive and there is currently a deficit of quality hotels.\" The hotels will be in a downtown port area the city is turning into a business and residential hub with a new road network and a light-rail system.\n\nEngineering and construction group Odebrecht will build and sell the properties and InterContinental will operate them, Mr Smaletz said. A group of investors is building Trump Towers Rio a few blocks from the InterContinental site.\n\nThe hotel association in Rio expects occupancy to surpass 90 per cent during the World Cup, which starts on June 12. Hotel capacity is expected to surge by nearly 50 per cent to 51,200 rooms in time for the Olympics, according to the Rio Negocios investment promotion agency.\n\nThe Holiday Inns will border the Mangue canal built in 1857 to drain nearby swamps and expand one of the main trading points in the Americas. The area turned into a passageway between the international airport and affluent neighbourhoods in south Rio with the construction of an elevated highway that began in the late 1950s. Businesses and residents moved out, leaving a cityscape of decaying and abandoned architecture.\n\nThe Rio government is predicting eight billion reais (S$4.5 billion) in investments, much of it ahead of the Olympics, to refurbish a five square kilometre section of the port area. The aim is to emulate London's Canary Wharf and Buenos Aires's Puerto Madero, revamped waterfront areas that attracted companies and homeowners, Mr Smaletz said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

For two nights only next week, three Asia-based chefs recognised by the prestigious global fellowship of individually owned and operated luxury hotels and restaurants will come together to present the Relais & Chateaux Diner des Grands Chefs Singapour.\n\nAs part of the dinner series, Emmanuel Stroobant from Saint Pierre in Singapore, Lanshu Chen from Le Mo\u00fbt Restaurant in Taiwan (recently named Asia's Best Female Chef in the 2014 Asia's 50 Best Restaurants Guide), Taichung and Hideaki Matsuo from the three Michelin-starred Kashiwaya in Osaka will collaborate on a six-course champagne dinner featuring Nicolas Feuillatte, Palms D'ors and Jacquesson to be served on May 22 ($288++ per person), and a six-course whisky pairing menu with Auchentoshan and Morrison Bowmore whiskies ($258++ per person) on May 23. The dinners seat up to 70 nightly and are part of a string of fine dining events taking place around the world to fete the 60th anniversary of the association's founding.\n\n\"We have been attending the Diner des Grands Chefs for the last few years as it is always exciting to see what other chefs do,\" says Mr Stroobant. And while most guest chef dinners held in Singapore focus on exclusively showcasing one chef, the three chefs behind the Diner des Grands Chefs Singapour will alternately send out individually crafted dishes, \"so you get to try a little of this and a bit of that, and get to see each chef's style showcased side by side in a single meal.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the quarter ended March 31, net profit was up 30 per cent from $27 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue trebled to $4.5 billion, a surge of 207 per cent from the previous year's $1.5 billion. Commodity marketing accounted for 93 per cent of total revenue. Gross profit rose 21 per cent to $86.2 million, mainly contributed by financial services, warehousing and logistics services.\n\n\"The results show that CWT is executing well in a challenging macro-economic environment and reaffirm our long-term strategy in providing diversified solutions around our core logistics activities,\" said CWT group CEO Loi Pok Yen.\n\nEarnings per share for the first quarter were 5.83 cents, up from 4.5 cents a year ago. As at March 31, the group had cash and equivalents of $237.8 million, compared with $184.3 million a year ago.\n\nCWT's acquisition of packing services and pallet provider Teng Lee Green Pack, in the first quarter, positions it to benefit from growing developments of chemical companies on Jurong Island. The group's subsidiary, Straits Financial, also recently obtained its Capital Market Service Licence, allowing it to conduct regulated activity of trading in futures contract, and expand beyond over-the-counter brokerage to offer a complete suite of commodity derivatives.\n\nIn the long term, the group will focus on creating warehouse capacity integral to its logistics solutions. Its latest warehouse project, CWT Pandan Logistics Centre, is about 60 per cent constructed, and is targeted to obtain its temporary occupation permit (TOP) by the end of this year. The construction of CWT Cold Hub 2 is more than 90 per cent completed and targeted for TOP in the second half of the year.\n\nCWT Cold Hub 2 will be home to CWT Logistics' subsidiary Singapore Wine Vault - set up to expand the wine storage business.\n\nCWT shares closed up 2.5 cents at $1.58 yesterday, before results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What I did not quite expect was how delightful it would be.\n\nI began with what I deemed would be drinking well now, wines such as l'Eglise Clinet 1996, Vieux Chateau Certan 2007, Lynch Bages 2004, Ducru Beaucaillou 2001, and to my delight, and that of my friends, they all not only did not disappoint but were lovely drinks.\n\nThey were not magical, they were simply delightful. They were not from 5-star vintages, just from reasonable ones and they all punched above their weight.\n\nThat was encouraging. It was time to look at the Firsts. Started tentatively with La Mission Haut Brion 2001, already 13 years old, from a good but not powerful vintage and should be more or less ready.\n\nChateau La Mission Haut Brion 2001, Grave Cru Classe\n\n48 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon, 45 per cent Merlot, 7 per cent Cabernet Franc. The Chateau was bought by the Dillons of Chateau Haut Brion in 1983 following the death in 1974 of Henri Woltner who had managed it magnificently. (Drunk a month ago).\n\nI find it useful to know the cepage of the wine as it helps to understand the taste. The high percentage of Merlot makes for a little softer palate. Medium-dark reddish brown, a distinct and lovely cedary bouquet. Quite elegant, not big or heavy, medium weight, well balanced with good ripe fruit and good freshness.\n\nA lovely and attractive drink, very satisfying. Quite ready, but capable of a little more development and will keep another 10 years, no hurry to drink the rest.\n\nLa Mission has always been a great favourite of mine. I first knew it when it was owned by Henri Woltner. During that period there was intense rivalry between Haut Brion, a Premier Cru Classe (Bordeaux First Growth), while La Mission was simply Grave Cru Classe.\n\nChateau Ausone 2002, Premier Grand Cru Classe A, Saint Emilion\n\nAt Teochew lunch. This proved a delight. (You can always tell a wine is very good when the bottle is emptied before any others!) Quite a bit darker than the 1996 l'Eglise Clinet which preceded it, denser, more intense in texture.\n\nA very lovely full-bodied aroma, very much Merlot in character; very rich, very sweet, ripe fruit; very concentrated. A very complex wine, well balanced and a big mouthful. At 12 years, still youthful, will need another three to four years, and it will last another 15 to 20. This wine with its richness and big but soft texture was a great accompaniment to the Teochew suckling pig.\n\nHaving broken ground with a 2002 Saint-Emilion Grand Cru Classe 'A', it was time to look at the left bank Firsts.\n\nChateau Latour 2003\n\nFirst bottle at dinner on May Day at home for some Malaysian and Indonesian friends. A wine I had been dying to drink ever since I tasted it en primeur in May 2004 at the Chateau itself.\n\nA huge wine. Opaque black-red, impenetrable. Bouquet faint at first, very Pauillac, with cedar and blackcurrants, slowly becoming stronger. Not powerful, almost understated.\n\nSumming up: A majestic wine, perfectly ripe blackcurrant fruit, lots of cedarwood flavours, well-balanced very complex, very concentrated, close to full maturity. Gorgeous! Massive rather than elegant. Altogether an almost perfect, complete Latour.\n\nChateau Latour 2003, second bottle\n\nMay 2, at Il-Lido Restaurant, Sentosa Golf Club. This bottle had been opened and decanted for the previous night's dinner (May 1), but was not drunk at all. So I poured it back into its original bottle (which had been duly washed) , and drank it at dinner at Il-Lido Restaurant, Sentosa Golf Club the next evening. How did this wine taste 24 hours later? Same taste profile and colours, a touch softer around the edges, very full-bodied, but seemed to have lost a bit of its edge though. Not that it spoiled the taste, just made the wine seem more developed. But that keen edge was missing.\n\nChateau Lafite Rothschild 2003\n\nAt dinner at home last Saturday, May 10. Finally took the plunge. Very dark red with a light brownish tint at the edges. Lovely delicate bouquet, very Cabernet Sauvignon in its lightish cedary aroma.\n\nGood density and volume in the mouth, very elegant where Latour was dense in volume, but Lafite even in its lightness displayed underlying complexity and strength. A youthful maturity with grace and concealed strength. At peak, but will hold for a long time. Beautiful wine. Elegance where Latour was power. A fascinating contrast. Should really drink them side-by-side.\n\nClearly the 2003s are on the threshold of maturity. They are already a great pleasure to drink although a little earlier in their life than is usual for them, no doubt courtesy of the heat and drought in 2003. A comparative tasting of all the Firsts would be fascinating.\n\nIn memoriam\n\nI began this week's column with a heavy heart. I had just received the profoundly sad news that Laurence Faller, winemaker of Domaine Weinbach, and the younger of the two daughters of Madam Colette Faller, owner of the Domaine, had just passed away from a heart attack. She was only 47. Immensely sad.\n\nShe leaves behind two children. The Faller family are good friends of ours whom we invariably visit whenever we are in Alsace. Readers of this column will doubtless have noted my fondness and admiration for Domaine Weinbach's wines. They have never failed to please. Laurence will be deeply missed. Rest in peace, Laurence.

With listings in about 34,000 cities around the world, the company is said to be valued at US$10 billion under a financing deal with TPG Capital.\n\nState regulations generally prohibit short-term rentals of entire private homes. Critics, including affordable housing advocates, said that Airbnb is driving up rents, while supporters such as the Washington-based Internet Association, which represents e-commerce companies Amazon.com Inc, EBay Inc and Twitter Inc, claimed that the service boosts local economies.\n\nThere is evidence that hosts are \"regularly using their apartments to provide lodging to guests who may not be complying with the state and local tax registration and/or collection requirements\", Mr Connolly said in his ruling.\n\nMatt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Mr Schneiderman, said that the judge \"rejected all of Airbnb's arguments except for a narrow technical issue\", and that the attorney-general will issue a new subpoena as early as this week.\n\n\"Our office is committed to enforcing a law that provides vital protections for building residents and tourists alike,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAirbnb has said that it wants to work with state officials to ease restrictive laws and find ways of collecting and remitting occupancy taxes. New York City hotel rooms are subject to a 14.75 per cent occupancy tax, according to Mr Connolly's decision.\n\nIn its challenge of the probe, Airbnb called the attorney-general's demand a \"government-sponsored fishing expedition\", and said that it lacked a reasonable basis, was too broad and burdensome and that it sought private information from users.\n\n\"This decision is good news for New Yorkers who simply want to share their home and the city they love,\" Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas said on Tuesday in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the Attorney-General's Office to make New York stronger for everyone.\"\n\nMr Schneiderman's office had asked for information for about 15,000 hosts that rent accommodations in New York state, including their names, addresses, contact information, addresses of the homes, and rental charges and communications related to taxes, according to papers filed by Airbnb with the Albany court.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of the service's listings in New York City on Jan 31 appeared to violate a 2010 law targeting illicit hotels, the state attorney-general's office found. Airbnb has said that it is open to reforming state law to allow it to collect and pay occupancy taxes.\n\nThe company said in April that it removed 2,000 listings in New York after Mr Schneiderman \"raised concerns about bad actors\" such as property managers with large numbers of listings.\n\n\"With all due respect to Airbnb, we want to be the ones to look at the data and make that determination,\" Mr Schneiderman said at a breakfast forum held by Crain's New York Business on April 24 in Manhattan.\n\n\"Much of the revenue of Airbnb is not nice people seeking to make ends meet,\" he said. \"This is an issue that is only in the beginning stages of an investigation.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was considering regulations for Airbnb during a public appearance last month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city is still sorting through issues that need to be reviewed, including revenue, security and law enforcement, according to a transcript.\n\n\"It's certainly something we'll be doing on the city level, working with our partners in the state government as well, but it's something that I think in general, government is grappling with as a new phenomenon,\" the mayor said, according to the transcript.\n\nNew York City public advocate Letitia James told the city's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in a May 12 letter that it should stop allowing Airbnb to use its advertising space until the service \"reforms its business practices\". Ms James sought immediate disclosure of all of Airbnb's advertising contracts for locations that the MTA controls.\n\nThe company's practices have led to the creation of de facto hotels without oversight and have driven up apartment prices, Ms James said in the letter to MTA chairman Thomas Prendergast.\n\nLisa Linden, a spokesman for the Hotel Association of New York City, a trade group representing more than 250 hotels, said on Tuesday that the judge provided a \"a clear road map for further enforcement\" of occupancy and tax laws by calling most of Airbnb's arguments unpersuasive or unnecessary.\n\nMr Connolly said in his decision that the attorney-general's request is too broad because it seeks information for all hosts in the state, even though some might be excluded from the occupancy and tax laws. New York's multiple dwelling law, for instance, applies only to cities of at least 325,000, according to the decision.\n\n\"I'm no lawyer, but this looks like the definition of a Pyrrhic victory for Airbnb,\" said state Senator Liz Krueger, of Manhattan, who sponsored a 2010 bill targeting illegal hotels. She said that Tuesday's \"decision gives Airbnb a little time, but it looks like that's all it gives them\".\n\nNew York lawmakers including Ms Krueger and US Representative Charles Rangel, both Democrats, called for increased enforcement of state and local rental laws in response to the dispute between the state attorney-general and Airbnb.\n\nThe group said in a statement in April that Airbnb may be used to illegally rent out as many as 3,000 units in Harlem, where rents have increased by about 27 per cent from 2006 to 2011. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The rest was held by David Ban Song Long, cousin-in-law of Mr Ong, and Mr Ban's spouse.\n\nStandard Chartered said yesterday that the offeror will not be deducting dividends for financial year 2013 from the revised offer price. \"Shareholders will retain the benefit of the FY2013 dividends to be paid by the company to entitled shareholders,\" it added.\n\nThe closing date of the offer period remains unchanged on June 2.\n\nAs of Monday, the offeror has received valid acceptances in respect of 691,950 HPL Shares, representing about 0.13 per cent of its issued share capital.\n\n68 Holdings had said that it does not intend to delist HPL from the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange. But it may not take steps to preserve the listing status of HPL in the event that HPL does not meet the free float requirement at the close of the offer.\n\nGaining majority control of HPL would make it easier for the consortium to re-develop HPL's adjoining assets - the Hilton and Four Seasons hotels, Forum the Shopping Mall and HPL House - along the sleepy end of the Orchard belt, analysts have observed.\n\nWheelock Place, an office and retail property, is separated from HPL's assets by the Angullia carpark, which is rumoured to be an acquisition target of HPL for re-development if HPL could persuade the authorities to sell the carpark.\n\nHPL has requested for the trading halt on its shares to be lifted today.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The majority of countries surveyed, especially those in Europe, are either freezing or cutting salaries.\n\nStella Tang, managing director of Robert Half Singapore, said that Singapore is a prime market for experienced finance and accounting professionals as their skills are in high demand.\n\n\"Much of the increase in salaries in Singapore is driven by competition for the best staff. Companies are confident in their growth prospects and are prepared to pay more to attract or retain the top people they need,\" she said. But she cautioned against unrealistic expectations on salary.\n\n\"While the trend is definitely up, it does not mean everyone should expect a pay rise. The ability to increase salaries depends on the performance of individual companies. Employees moving to new firms are likely to get a bigger pay rise than employees staying where they are. Moving to a new company can often see a finance and accounting professional's salary jump by a double-digit percentage,\" she added.\n\nIn large Singapore firms with more than 1,000 staff, 65 per cent have raised pay for finance and accounting staff. This compares with 54 per cent at smaller firms with less than 500 employees and 51 per cent at medium-sized firms.\n\nThe survey also found that finance and accounting staff here have a good chance of getting a bigger bonus this year. Some 37 per cent of companies are increasing bonuses while 59 per cent are paying the same as last year.\n\nCompared to the rest of the world, Singapore has the third highest number of companies that are increasing bonuses for finance and accounting professionals, putting it behind China and Hong Kong and on a par with Australia and Brazil.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/uol-bulk-leases-good-or-bad-strategy", "site_title": "UOL bulk leases: a good or bad strategy?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUOL bulk leases: a good or bad strategy?\n\nKalpana Rashiwala\n\nPublished Thu, May 15, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA RECENT long-lease agreement between UOL Group and the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board has raised an interesting question: Is it better, from a shareholder point of view, for an office landlord to lease out a large chunk of office space on a long lease to one single tenant or to have the space divided and leased to a number of smaller tenants on shorter leases and thus achieving higher per-square-foot (psf) rents?\n\nThe lease agreement between UOL Group and the CPF Board involves the renting of nearly 210,000 sq ft that will be vacated at Novena Square's two office towers by Procter & Gamble (P&G) when its leases expire in two tranches: in mid-2015 and 2016.\n\nAt first glance, having smaller tenants is the better option, as it appears to maximise revenues. But on closer examination, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nThe CPF Board will start renting the space at Novena Square from the fourth quarter of next year. The initial lease term is understood to be 10 years with options for renewal. Talk in the market is that rental rates are likely to be staggered, but the average monthly rent over the duration of the lease term is believed to be in the low $7 psf range.\n\nThis is the second major bulk office leasing deal UOL has announced in the past three years. In October 2011, its hotel arm Pan Pacific Hotels Group revealed it had inked a 30-year-lease agreement with the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) for the whole of One Upper Pickering, a 15-storey office block with 87,067 sq ft net lettable area (NLA). That building was completed in late 2012 and the AGC began operating from the new premises in March 2013.\n\nLump-sum payment\n\nInstead of paying a monthly rental, the AGC paid an upfront lease premium of $127.2 million in one lump sum. Based on a straight-line calculation, that sum translates to a monthly rent of just over $4 psf. When service charge is included, net present value calculations reflect an average gross effective monthly rental of about $7 psf - below the $9-$10 psf that comparable buildings in the vicinity are said to be commanding. Likewise at Novena Square, rents are said to be around $8-$8.50 psf a month. Both figures apply to smaller areas of under 5,000 sq ft.\n\nSo it is that UOL's bulk leasing deals at One Upper Pickering and Novena Square Towers beg the question whether the property group could have fetched higher rental income by sourcing for a string of smaller tenants - instead of jumping into a deal with a large tenant, and that too ahead of the space being available. Moreover, the timing of the deal with the CPF Board is interesting given that UOL, in its recent first-quarter results statement, said: \"Rentals of office space are expected to move upwards amidst rising market confidence.\" So why the rush if the Singapore office market has seen improved conditions since the second half of last year?\n\nConfidence in the sector is being boosted by reports of improved demand from occupiers in sectors such as oil and gas, pharmaceutical, social media, information technology and insurance. Moreover, CBD (central business district) office supply is expected to be tight in the short term, with no major completions expected next year. Given this positive short-term outlook for the Singapore office market, landlords are able to push for higher rents. However, supply is expected to pick up again starting from 2016 - with major completions such as Guoco Tower in Tanjong Pagar, 5 Shenton Way, Marina One, Duo in Ophir Road and Frasers Centrepoint's project in Telok Ayer Street. While there are new office demand drivers, there hasn't been much visibility on new demand from banks, the major occupiers of CBD offices.\n\nUOL may have had this in mind in deciding to lock in the CPF Board as an anchor tenant at Novena Square for the space to be vacated by P&G. Clinching the CPF Board at Novena Square is no small feat either. While Novena Square is a good class development, it is 14 years old and in recent times, large occupiers typically have preferred to move into new developments.\n\nStrong plus point\n\nMoreover, the strong tenant covenant that comes from blue-chip government occupiers such as the CPF Board and AGC is a strong plus point as far as security and stability of leases go. There are other plus points in UOL's strategy. In the case of Novena Square, the near dovetailing of the expiry of the first tranche of P&G's lease with the start of the CPF Board's lease allows UOL to minimise vacancy. And by leasing a chunk of space to a single tenant, it extracts higher NLA - compared with carving out smaller rental units, which entails setting aside more corridor space and other common areas. In other words, while UOL may have been able to achieve higher $ psf rents from renting the space to many small occupiers, the overall rental collection may not be higher.\n\nMoreover, having a large number of small tenants on short leases typically of three years means that there're likely to be more changes of tenants, implying higher incidence of void space and vacancies. And commissions/marketing costs will likewise go up for a landlord that has to find replacement tenants more frequently - compared with taking a blue-chip tenant on a longer lease.\n\nIn the case of a deal like One Upper Pickering, the substantial sum of $127.2 million from the upfront 30-year-lease sale would come in handy to a landlord: to repay borrowings or even fund the development itself, for instance.\n\nSome industry watchers expect more government agencies to seek long-term leases for large office space as they decentralise. They can negotiate for lower rents, and by locking in a lease for a longer period, are assured of continuity of operating from the same location.\n\nGiven the plus points for landlords, such leases may not be a bad idea.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The sales volume of new apartments in Tokyo that cost more than 100 million yen surged as much as 20 per cent last year, while sales of existing apartments rose 5 per cent, added Hiroi, citing the company's research.\n\nGrosvenor is betting on changing tastes among Japanese homebuyers. The number of people who prefer to buy and live in newly built apartments has remained above 96 per cent over the last decade, according to a report by Recruit Sumai Co, a Tokyo-based housing information provider. About 44 per cent of homebuyers surveyed said they prefer existing units, an increase from 33 per cent in 2003, the report revealed.\n\n\"It used to be that new houses would cost more,\" said Mr Hiroi on May 12. \"However, Japan's housing market has matured. Like Europe or the US, the value of good-quality housing should be sustainable after renovation.\"\n\nTransactions of previously owned homes account for 14 per cent of the total in Japan, according to Japan's land ministry. That compares with 90 per cent in the US, 86 per cent in the UK and 64 per cent in France, it said.\n\nThe market for renovated residential apartments in Japan is estimated to be about 6.5 trillion yen and accounts for 28 per cent of total residential investment, according to the land ministry. The ratio of investment in refurbished apartments in the country compares to 57 per cent in the UK and 77 per cent in Germany, the same report showed.\n\nGrosvenor entered Japan's market in 2001 and opened its Tokyo office the following year. One of Grosvenor's first projects was an apartment building nearby Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo. The company in 2008 turned the property into a 45-unit luxury residential complex that it rents out.\n\nThe highest monthly rent at Grosvenor Place Kamizonocho is about three million yen, or as much as 28,000 yen per tsubo, which is among the most expensive residential rent in Japan, he said. A tsubo, a standard measure of property area in Japan, is 3.3 square metres or 35.5 square feet.\n\nGrosvenor invests in luxury residential sector by buying existing apartment buildings and sell or rent them out after refurbishment depending on market condition, Mr Hiroi said. The company also buys land and develop projects on its own.\n\nSince 2011, Grosvenor has acquired more than 40 billion yen of residential buildings in Tokyo, Mr Hiroi added. Grosvenor is turning a 14-story building, built in 2003, in Roppongi into luxury units that cost as much as 500 million yen. Grosvenor sold 20 of the 99 units last year and plans to release 20 more this year, including a penthouse which may cost even more, Mr Hiroi said.\n\nTurning units into luxury apartments offers a return of about 10 per cent to 15 per cent, he explained.\n\nGrosvenor has invested more than US$2 billion in residential, office and commercial buildings.

Not that Nato is likely to take up arms against China over the stationing of the rig in disputed waters, or over territorial disputes involving the Paracel and Spratly Islands, but China's latest action does allow Japan to point the finger and say \"we told you so\" to Nato and others. Beijing's timing was infelicitous too in that the stationing of a lumbering and highly conspicuous oil rig off Vietnam coincided more or less with the holding of an Asean leaders' summit in Myanmar. Predictably, the Asean leaders protested at China's action.\n\nMr Abe has spent a good deal of time and energy playing up the \"China threat\" both domestically and internationally since his Liberal Democratic Party-led government swept to power at the end of 2012. But his success in making China appear as the villain had been limited so far.\n\nThe Japanese leader was, of course, focusing on China's rival claim (along with that of Taiwan and others) to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea rather than on natural resources and fishing grounds in the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and others as well as by China.\n\nBut it was always possible for China to argue with some legitimacy that Japan precipitated a conflict over the Senkakus by the heavy-handed decision of former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda to \"nationalise\" the territories on behalf of the Japanese government in 2012.\n\nThe rest of the world did not appear eager to get involved in the dispute on either side and even Japan's formal \"ally\", the United States, has been clearly very reluctant to get dragged into the Senkaku Islands dispute under the terms of its Mutual Security Treaty with Japan.\n\nChina may now have changed this situation \"at a stroke\" however, with what looks like an even more heavy-handed and bullying tactic towards Vietnam (with an attendant and implicit threat against the Philippines and others) in stationing the massive oil rig in a provocative location.\n\nBumping and banging between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels at sea around the rig is reminiscent of similar tactics that were employed between Chinese and Japanese boats in the vicinity of the Senkaku Islands a year or so ago, and does none of the parties' images or credit any good. At some point, hopefully before more serious conflict erupts, as it surely will if Vietnam or even Japan attempt to \"confront\" China at sea, the issue of maritime claims can be settled by diplomacy and compromise, as others (including Bangladesh and Myanmar) have proved capable of doing.\n\nBut, for the moment, China appears to have ceded the moral high ground by its resort to oil rig politics, and that will not go down well with an international community that up to now had appeared anxious to remain neutral and not to get involved on Japan's or anyone else's side.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two Sembcorp-run Vietnam Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs) were among several industrial zones hit by the unrest.\n\nThe Singapore government yesterday urged the Vietnamese authorities to restore law and order \"before the security situation worsens and investor confidence is undermined\".\n\nWhile businessmen The Business Times spoke to appeared largely unfazed by the protests - most said the turmoil was likely a one-off isolated incident - analysts warned that undertones of antagonism towards China could be a recurring theme in the socialist republic.\n\nReuters reported Tran Van Nam, vice-chairman of Binh Duong Province People's Committee, as saying to local reporters: \"About 19,000 workers were demonstrating against China's violation of Vietnam's territorial waters . . . Some workers turned angry, destroying companies' gates and entering the compounds and asking other workers to join a strike.\"\n\nReports suggest that the rioters had wanted to target Chinese companies and employees, but ended up trashing Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong factories instead, after mistaking them for Chinese-owned facilities - perhaps because of Mandarin-looking characters on logos and signboards.\n\nSeveral industrial parks were said to be affected too, with more than a dozen foreign-owned factories torched - although no official numbers have been given. There were no reports of casualties; police are said to be holding almost 500 people for questioning.\n\nAt the two VSIPs, four factories from China and Taiwan (which made garments and electronics) were set on fire. Of the 424 companies operating there, 99 tenants were affected by the protests, when crowds bashed windows and doors in, and looted factories.\n\nThe two VSIPs were set up in 1996 and 2006, as part of Vietnam's efforts to attract foreign investments into the country. The parks are the result of a collaboration between Vietnam's state-owned Becamex IDC Corp and a Singapore consortium lead by Sembcorp. The latter effectively holds a 47 per cent share in the joint-venture company that manages the parks.\n\nMainboard-listed Sembcorp said that protesters were still circling the two parks as at press time, though riotous activities were being controlled by VSIP security officers and local police who remained on-site. Though more than 200 people have been evacuated from the two VSIPs, BT understands that some parts of the industrial zone remain unaffected and some tenants are continuing with operations.\n\nThe tumult in Binh Duong comes days after protests were staged in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City over the past week. Earlier this month, China moved a drilling rig to a location 120 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam, in a part of the South China Sea claimed by the latter.\n\nYesterday, a spokesman for Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said that MFA had called in the Vietnam ambassador to Singapore to register its \"serious concerns\" about the security situation in VSIP I and II, and the attacks on foreign companies in the two industrial parks. The spokesman added: \"Singapore views this issue very seriously given our close economic cooperation with Vietnam.\"\n\nBut businessmen who have a stake in the Binh Duong VSIPs do not seem too ruffled by the incident. T Chandroo, chairman and CEO of Modern Montessori International (MMI) - which has poured $2 million to build its first school in Vietnam - told BT: \"So far we've never heard of any such incidents happening in Vietnam. I take it as a one-off thing, and I'm very confident things will settle down.\"\n\nBut analysts have another take. Said Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho: \"I think it's a rude awakening for foreign investors and potential foreign investors, and these things are going to be factored into any company's strategic investments in Vietnam. If your production and supply chains straddle China and Vietnam (as many operations do), things may not be so smooth.\n\n\"No one saw this coming, and this anti-Chinese sentiment is not going to go away anytime soon. It looks more like it's going to be a protracted series of geopolitical risk flares, which will result in more of what we've just seen (in Binh Duong).\"\n\nAdded CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"We've already seen this happen between Japan and China - they squabbled over islands, and two-way trade (took a hit) for a good year or so. Depending on how officials respond, the same thing could happen here this time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A new culinary experience has been added to music, food, fashion, words, photography, and its strongest point - theatre.\n\nThe Sin-Pen Colony (Sin-Pen after the Singapore to Penang flights), explains the concept's curator and actor Tan Kheng Hua, is a pop-up festival within GTF in August, from Aug 23 to 31. \"The two islands were once joined by the Crown, as Straits Settlements, both were ports-of-call receiving and entertaining explorers, missionaries and merchants from mysterious worlds across the seas,\" highlights Tan. With a shared history of harbouring Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat Sen, and both being developed by migrant communities which led to its multi-cultural societies, Penang and Singapore are simply, she puts it, sister islands.\n\nThis year's Sin-Pen Colony will revolve around four events. The first is a newly-written, site-specific play, 2 Houses, by Lim Yu Beng performed in a historical grand mansion in Penang's former Millionaire's Row. And then there's Singapore House II, following the template set last year where a selected cross-section of Singapore's creative brought in their wares. This year's participants include Books Actually, LoveSG, Chalk, MandyT, visual artists Alan Oei and Samantha \"Sticker Lady\" Lo, musicians The Sam Willows and Inch Chua.

No dividends were declared for the period.\n\nThe private education provider, which registered a surge in other operating income from $9.5 million to $47.7 million for the January-March fiscal Q3, said this was mainly due to a pre-tax gain of $46.1 million from the \"divestment of investment properties of 490 mu land and properties in Oriental University City\".\n\nRevenue for the three months edged up to $31.7 million from $31.4 million because of a slight increase in China revenue.\n\nFor the first nine months ended March 31, net profit was $27.1 million, up from $13.3 million, while revenue dipped 2 per cent to $95.2 million.\n\nThe group also said yesterday that its 50 per cent owned education and training arm, Value Vantage, had on Monday sold its entire stake in Value Vantage Hangzhou (VVH) to Shanghai Jin Hui Investment and Management Co for 850 million yuan (S$170.9 million).\n\nIn a filing to the Singapore Exchange yesterday, Raffles Education said it will cease to own any interest in VVH upon completion of the transaction, which is subject to various approvals.\n\nThe 850 million yuan consideration would be paid in two cash instalments.\n\nThe first - 100 million yuan within 15 days from the agreement date - has been paid out, said Raffles Education.\n\nThe second - the remaining 750 million yuan - will be paid out in equivalent foreign currency within six months after completion of the registration of transfer of the equity interest.\n\nRaffles Education's share of the book value of the equity interest stood at about $40.7 million, while its share of the net tangible assets value of the equity interest was about $26.5 million as at end-December, according to its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended Dec 31, 2013.\n\nThe group said yesterday that it has seen its PRC college revenue stabilising and that the group is continuing to see positive outcomes from its transformational strategies in the PRC.\n\nIt is also continuing to see positive outcomes from its expansion strategy in the ex-PRC region.\n\nThe counter ended trading half a cent higher at 29.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China is poised to become the world's second-largest market, after the US, by 2017, according to the World Travel Market and Euromonitor International.\n\nChinese cruise customers are typically younger than travellers from Europe and the US with many 25-to-45-year-olds travelling with their children and parents, Mr Buckelew said.\n\nThe Chinese tend to have less vacation time, so itineraries focus on three- to five-day voyages, he added.\n\nOne reason the Chinese market is growing fast is that its younger customers are active in social media, Buckelew noted.\n\n\"They're taking pictures of the meals they're eating, pushing them out to their friends,\" he said. \"The cruise story is getting out a lot quicker.\"\n\nThe Sapphire Princess, Carnival's first premium-priced ship in the region, begins a four-month season in Shanghai on May 21.\n\nCustomised touches for the market include Tai Chi classes and English-style afternoon tea.\n\nPrincess and Costa cruises are two of the 10 lines operated by Carnival.\n\nThe seven-year-old Costa Serena features a two-level spa with Turkish bath, a Grand Prix-racing simulator, water slide, casino and outdoor jogging track.

Something needs to change,\" said Father Piero Galvano, the local director for the Catholic charity Caritas.\n\nMany of the survivors from Monday's accident in international waters between Libya and Italy were from Eritrea, Nigeria and Syria.\n\nThe victims included 12 women and three children, with more still missing.\n\nCatania's Deputy Mayor Marco Consoli, who was also at the port, said: \"We have taken in thousands of people from all around the world, victims of hunger and war.\n\n\"Sadly, today we are also taking in 17 bodies. If we are usually at 100 per cent, today we are at 200,\" he said.\n\nSurvivors will initially be housed in a local sports facility but longer-term shelter will be harder as all the asylum centres in Sicily are badly overcrowded.\n\nInterior Minister Angelino Alfano urged more assistance from Europe for border patrols, threatening that otherwise Italy would defy European Union asylum rules and allow migrants to travel on to other countries in Europe.\n\n\"We'll just let them go,\" he said, although the Dublin Convention states that migrants must remain in the country in which they arrive and make their asylum application until their status as refugees is approved.\n\nMr Alfano also said the EU should intervene in Libya to stop the migrants from leaving in the first place and called for the EU's Frontex border agency to be moved from Poland to Italy to improve coordination.\n\nThe ministry reported 36,000 migrants landing so far this year - many from Eritrea, Somalia and Syria - compared to 42,925 for all of 2013, 13,267 in 2012 and 63,000 in 2011 at the height of the Arab Spring revolts. Hundreds, and sometimes thousands, drown every year.\n\nCountries in southern Europe complain that they are shouldering the burden of migrant arrivals but northern European states take in more confirmed refugees, while border agency Frontex is stretched thin.\n\n\"Europe is leaving us on our own,\" Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who has promised to make immigration a top priority during Italy's EU presidency this year, said on ReteQuattro television after Monday's disaster.\n\n\"It can't save governments and banks and then let mothers and children die,\" Mr Renzi said.\n\nThe Italian navy said the rescue operation after Monday's incident had involved warships, coast guard and border patrol vessels as well as merchant ships.\n\nThe United Nations' refugee agency estimated that 170 people have died at sea trying to reach Europe this year off Greece, Italy and Libya as well as in international waters.\n\nThe UNHCR said search and rescue operations should be \"further strengthened\" and asked for the international community to find legal alternatives like resettlement to stop refugees from making dangerous journeys.\n\nItalian media cited coast guards as saying that around 400 asylum-seekers may have been on board the boat, which would leave dozens still unaccounted for.\n\nBut Mauro Casinghini, director of rescue services in Italy for the Order of Malta, which had a doctor and two nurses assisting survivors with the coast guard at the scene, said there were some 250 people on the boat.\n\nMr Casinghini described to AFP scenes from the shipwreck as recounted to him by the doctor, Antonella Godino.\n\nA Somali woman, Amina, was found gripping a piece of wood floating in the water and holding on to her four-month-old baby after the boat capsized and sank. \"She nearly didn't make it. The waves were lapping at her chin and she was barely holding her baby above the water,\" he cited Ms Godino as saying.\n\nThe Italian navy launched a large-scale operation to rescue migrants and deter traffickers following two separate shipwreck tragedies in October 2013 in which more than 400 people drowned off Italy's shores. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2fcd65aa140fcbd231533117e3905f3879045e977df9e64d20bfeaf83d7ae370?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Safe for now: Survivors of the migrant boat shipwreck waiting on board an Italian warship before disembarking at Catania harbour on Tuesday. - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

The port, which can't be accessed without going through Manila's roads, handles more than half of the nation's overseas freight.\n\nWhile the ban was intended to ease chronic gridlock in the heart of a region of almost 23 million people, the shipping backlogs have become so severe they are being called a drag on the country's growth.

Besides hypermarket FairPrice Xtra, food court chain Foodfare and climbing-wall operator Climb Central, Kallang Wave's confirmed tenants include Uniqlo, H&M, Forever 21 and Harvey Norman.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of the 41,000-sq-m mall, whose official opening is planned for July, is occupied, said Kallang Wave's manager, SMRT Alpha.\n\n\"We are appealing to a broad spectrum of Singaporeans, from seniors, lifestylers, sports enthusiasts families (to) youths,\" said SMRT Alpha director Dawn Low. \"The tenant mix has been engineered and curated to address basically a broad spectrum of needs.\"\n\nThat said, the mall is decidedly sports-themed. With their 1,000 sq m of climbing surface, the climbing towers in the mall's atrium will be the largest air-conditioned climbing wall - and the tallest indoor one - in Singapore, said operator Climb Central.\n\nEven familiar tenants have been given a sporting update. FairPrice Xtra will offer not just groceries, electronics or casual wear, but bicycles, sporting equipment and sportswear. Foodfare plans to be as accommodating to sports enthusiasts, offering a bicycle parking corner and an emphasis on healthy food options.\n\nSome tenants will also be launching new business lines with Kallang Wave's soft opening starting progressively in June.\n\nSportsLink, for example, will open its first running-centric concept store, Runnur, in the mall. Likewise, Power Up Express's retail unit in the mall will also offer podiatric consultation, sports taping and sports massage services, a combination that the firm says will be a first for Singapore.\n\n\"We are creating a diverse, inspiring and inclusive experience that encourages people to make sports part of their daily lives,\" said Sports Hub chief operating officer Oon Jin Teik. \"With its innovative layout and tenant selection, we are confident the Kallang Wave will attract a strong interest even among the less active to participate in sports.\"\n\nSMRT Alpha, a joint venture between SMRT Investments and NTUC FairPrice subsidiary Alphaplus Investments, also announced that Citibank and OCBC Bank will be Kallang Wave's bank partners.\n\nBoth banks are planning year-long sponsorship deals, during which Citibank SMRT Platinum Visa cardmembers will enjoy shopping and dining deals at the mall. By spending money at Kallang Wave, Citibank SMRT cardmembers can redeem vouchers to offset SMRT taxi fares or free bus and train rides there.\n\nMeanwhile, OCBC cardholders will enjoy year-round parking privileges at the mall, as well as benefits at the Women's Tennis Association Championships that will be held at the Sports Hub in October when they shop at Kallang Wave.\n\nCitibank will provide ATM facilities in the mall, while OCBC will have a branch there open six days a week.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A spokesman said that the company could only confirm that this was due to market developments, without specifying what they were.\n\nUnder last September's agreement, SATS' wholly owned subsidiary, SATS Airport Services (SAS), was to directly own 92 per cent of SCC, while SATS-Creuers, another subsidiary, would own 8 per cent. SAS's 60 per cent stake in SATS-Creuers means that SATS would have effectively own 96.8 per cent of SCC and would, in effect, have paid $106.5 million of the purchase price.\n\nThe deal was expected to be completed once it received regulatory approval.\n\nCompletion of the deal would have given SATS primary hold of the cruise terminal services market in Singapore. The SATS-Creuers joint venture, a partnership between SAS and Spanish cruise terminal partner Creuers Del Port de Barcelona, was SATS's ticket to the cruise terminal market. The joint venture cliched a 10-year contract in December 2011 to run the Marina Bay Cruise Centre.\n\nThrough the SCC, SATS would have gained control of the international cruise terminal and regional ferry terminal at HarbourFront Centre as well as the Tanah Merah and Pasir Panjang ferry terminals.\n\nSingapore's competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS), told BT yesterday that it had been informed (during Phase 2 of its assessment) that the parties involved have decided not to proceed with the merger. \"As such, there is no longer any merger for CCS to consider.\"\n\nThe SATS spokesman said that the issue at hand was not a regulatory one as the \"CCS had yet to issue its decision\".\n\nTemasek also did not reveal its reasons.\n\nHowever, a source familiar with the deal said that the termination was purely a business decision based on \"market conditions\". The source believes that the deal is not entirely off the table and may take a different form or structure in the future.\n\nIronically, back in September, SATS had said that the $110 million price tag for the SCC took into account \"current market conditions\" and business prospects of SCC.\n\nAnalysts were equally puzzled about the deal's termination. Derrick Heng, an analyst at Maybank, said that it was difficult to make sense of the news since very little had been disclosed and he was awaiting more updates from SATS's management.\n\n\"This announcement does not in any way alter SATS's commitment to grow our successful operations at the Marina Bay Cruise Centre and to promote Singapore as a home port, nor our ambition to pursue regional cruise opportunities,\" Alex Hungate, SATS's president and CEO, said in a statement yesterday.\n\nSATS's shares closed two cents higher at $3.21 yesterday, before the termination of the deal was announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It surveyed EY indirect tax professionals in 86 countries.\n\nIt found that indirect tax payers, eg those who pay taxes such as Singapore's Goods & Services Tax (GST) and value-added taxes (VAT) in other countries, currently file periodic VAT/GST returns electronically in 66 countries, and pay these tax balances electronically in 75 countries.\n\nThen, there are additional reporting requirements, over and above the periodic filings. For example, annual VAT/GST returns are requested in 38 countries (25 of these use e-filing), and 44 countries require VAT/GST payers to submit additional reports - such as lists of customers and suppliers - to the tax administration, of which 37 countries use e-filing.\n\nGiven that a lot of tax data is now filed electronically, many tax administrators now use data analytics to analyse and compare data from different organisations to collect and protect tax revenues. Data extraction is also helping tax administrators perform \"smarter\" tax audits, EY said, to identify underpayments and systemic weaknesses, as well as carry out risk-based audits.\n\nFor Singapore, in particular, partner and leader for GST Services at EY in Singapore, Yeo Kai Eng, noted: \"Electronic filing of GST returns . . . allows the IRAS to use data analytics to identify potential errors and irregularities.\"\n\nEY's survey found that 69 of the 86 countries surveyed reported that their tax administration uses data extracted electronically from taxpayers' systems to carry out VAT/GST audits - and that this number is set to increase.\n\nTaxpayers, therefore, need to ensure that they make use of available technology to at least keep pace with, if not stay ahead of, the game.\n\nEY's report indicated, however, that many tax and trade functions still struggle to make the business case for investment in indirect tax technology, as it is often seen simply as an overhead cost rather than a vital contributor to reducing risk and improving operational efficiency.\n\nMr Robinson noted: \"Tax executives want access to the same type of data analysis software used by tax auditors to identify errors and opportunities. But this is often still on the 'wish list'. However, given the intention of tax administrations to increase their use of advanced software tools and the intensity of their data-led audits, multinational organisations will have to respond.\n\n\"Gaining visibility over the financial impact of indirect tax obligations, risk and opportunities is an important step to establishing an effective indirect tax strategy. As companies begin to outsource tax compliance and run their own data warehousing and dash boarding solutions, their analysis of tax and trade data is becoming much more proactive.\n\n\"So, what is a 'nice to have' today is likely to become a 'must-have' for tomorrow,\" he concluded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Vopak had earlier announced the project last December, but without citing the South Korean company's participation then.\n\nWith Infineum's project, \"we have anchored regional manufacturing facilities for the top four additives players, who collectively account for more than 80 per cent of the global market share. This places Singapore in pole position as the key manufacturing hub for lubricant additives in Asia\", Mr Iswaran said.\n\nWhile Infineum officials were guarded about disclosing the capacity of its latest calcium salicylate venture here - the first of its kind in the Asia Pacific and only its second after one in France - they said that it was of sufficient scale to cater to projected demand for the unique detergent component.\n\nThe Asia Pacific, where demand for salicylate is projected to be significantly higher than the 2 per cent annual global growth rate, is a key growth market for the additive, which is marketed to passenger car, heavy-duty and marine lubricant formulators, Mr Russell said. \"Supply reliability is one of Infineum's highest priorities . . . and with this investment, the Singapore plant will become a manufacturing hub for calcium salicylate,\" he added.\n\nInfineum secures chemical feedstocks for the plant, which just started operations last month, from various suppliers here, including ExxonMobil which is right next door. It also imports olefins from Qatar. The salicylate plant is Infineum's second facility on JI, following an earlier project which makes additives used in applications such as heavy duty diesel engine oil and automatic transmission fluids.\n\nAsked about main challenges encountered here, Infineum's venture manager, Xavier Leleux, said it has been smooth sailing at its Singapore operations, given the excellent workforce and talent base available.\n\nThe group employs around 300 workers including at its technology centre here. While it has no firm plans currently, there is room at its JI site for future expansion, added Mr Leleux.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The vote wrapped up on Monday and official results will be announced on Friday.\n\nIndian shares posted fresh record highs yesterday and the rupee hit a 10-month peak after the exit polls bolstered expectations that Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies would clinch the 272 parliamentary seats needed for a ruling majority.\n\nIndia's NSE index jumped as much as 2.3 per cent to 7,172.35 points yesterday and has soared by nearly a fifth since Mr Modi became the BJP's candidate for prime minister on Sept 13.\n\n\"The market is now kind of priced to perfection,\" said Ritesh Jain, chief investment officer at Tata Asset Management.\n\nThose projections may have altered expectations ahead of the actual results, according to some brokers and investors. They now say that even a number of 240 seats or below for the BJP, which until Monday had been widely forecast, would prove disappointing to markets.\n\nExit polls in India are notoriously unreliable and in the past two elections have overstated the BJP's seat haul.\n\nInvestors hope Mr Modi will drive home a pro-growth agenda the way he did as chief minister of Gujarat state, where he has enjoyed an electoral mandate that he would not have as prime minister even under the most optimistic scenario for his party.\n\nOther uncertainties include a central bank governor who last week vowed to maintain his focus on inflation at a time when the BJP and its partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have campaigned on reviving economic growth.\n\nSome in the market warn that investors will need to see more proof that corporate earnings are on the mend before pushing shares up much further, even as forward price-to-earnings multiples are historically inexpensive at around 15 times.\n\nThe rupee, meanwhile, hovered near a 10-month high and 15 per cent above the record low hit in late August when India was gripped by its worst market turmoil since a balance of payments crisis in 1991.\n\nFurther rupee gains could prove elusive as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been buying dollars in a bid to bolster its foreign exchange reserves.\n\nBond investors will focus on the RBI's monetary policy review on June 3 after central bank governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday reiterated that he - and not the Indian government - was responsible for setting monetary policy.\n\nAlthough Mr Rajan is expected to keep interest rates on hold next month after data on Monday showed consumer inflation rising only modestly in April, any big uptick in food prices could trigger central bank tightening, analysts said.\n\nInvestors, and credit rating agencies, will also closely examine the policies of the incoming government at a time when the country's fiscal deficit is being contained by measures such as curbs on gold imports that may prove unsustainable.\n\n\"A lot needs to be done in terms of political, fiscal and economic reforms. Earnings also need to catch up,\" said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance. \"A lot would depend on policies and decision-making.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Company officials said MAS is targeting May 28 for the major restructuring.\n\nMAS has also decided to cancel some contracts that are squeezing its profits and sign new agreements at competitive rates, they said.\n\n\"By cancelling some of the contracts, MAS will be able to save more than RM200 million (S$77.3 million) a year,\" said an official.\n\nHe said MAS will also let go of excess workers and relook the salaries of staff, including those in key management positions. \"This is the first step in returning to the black. The next step is to streamline operations, look at more profitable routes and change the top management,\" he added.\n\nMAS has about 20,000 workers.\n\nThe airline embarked on a massive restructuring plan at the end of 2011 with the aim of reducing costs and returning to full profitability last year. Despite the restructuring, MAS lost RM4 billion in three years.\n\nAnalysts said MAS should spend less on mass-market advertising and start rebuilding its brand through other means that do not increase expenditure.\n\n\"MAS should also explore new opportunities in the airline industry to diversify its income stream,\" said an analyst.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported on Monday that MAS and its key stakeholders are in talks with banks for a strategic overhaul that could include the partial sale of its engineering unit and an upgrade of its ageing fleet, sources involved in the discussions said.\n\nEven before the loss of its flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, there was talk that loss-making MAS might need a financial rescue from state investor Khazanah Nasional, which owns 69 per cent of the company.\n\n\"They are sending all these feelers to banks to try and test the waters,\" said a banking source familiar with the situation.\n\n\"The most imminent move looks to be on the engineering business, an IPO or trade sale,\" said the source.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Last month, the maker of display products such as PC monitors and TV sets warned that it expects to record US$40 million to US$60 million net loss for the period.\n\nTPV is listed in Hong Kong and Singapore. Its Q1 2014 results statement yesterday showed the widening loss was on the back of a 3.9 per cent year-on-year drop in revenue to US$2.56 billion, as global demand for TVs and monitors remained subdued.\n\nChina, the world's largest TV market, lost its growth momentum while Europe's economic recovery was fragile. The Russia-Ukraine conflict dampened market sentiment further.\n\nThe group's bottom line was also hit by continued weakening of emerging-market currencies including the renminbi, and one-off restructuring expenses related to the optimisation of TPV's R&D organisation in Europe.\n\nOn the bright side, the group's gross profit margin improved to 8.9 per cent, up from 6.4 per cent in Q4 last year and 7.6 per cent a year earlier.\n\nThe group posted US$19.8 million realised and unrealised losses on foreign exchange forward contracts and options in Q1 2014 - contrasting with US$26.4 million gains on this item in Q1 last year. R&D expenses climbed to US$90.3 million, from US$68.6 million in Q1 last year.\n\nThe group said it continued with the restructuring of TP Vision by combining its innovation sites in Eindhoven in the Netherlands and Bruges in Belgium into a single site in Ghent, Belgium.\n\nThe new innovation centre, which will come into operation in mid-2014, will be responsible for product strategies and the development of the next generation of products. The one-off expenses relating to this relocation were around US$32.3 million.\n\nIn March this year, the group inked an agreement to buy Philips' 30 per cent interest in TP Vision. Completion of this transaction will make TP Vision a fully owned subsidiary of the group, which will enable its further integration into the group's TV operations, thus giving it the leverage needed to support and speed up the execution of sale and supply decisions.\n\nTPV said it has been fine-tuning its product portfolio to optimise product deliverables and improve margin realisation. \"With fewer stock-keeping units (SKUs) and a range of attractive new products, including the Android-based TV, the potential for achieving greater volumes and margins is higher than ever.\"\n\nThe group's loss per share rose to 2.15 US cents in Q1 this year, from 0.21 US cent in the same quarter last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After more than a week of trading, the share price has stagnated, trading between $1.13 and $1.20.\n\nIt closed on Monday at $1.15, as it did on seven of the 10 days it has traded.\n\nAustralian financial institution Macquarie Warrants (Macquarie) last week listed call warrants on POSH expecting demand for the stock but has been \"disappointed\" with the stock's performance thus far.\n\n\"We listed (warrants on) POSH because it was the biggest IPO this year and so we were anticipating demand but since the date of listing, the warrant has just been quiet because there hasn't been much volatility in the underlying stock as well,\" Jamie Chung, senior manager with Macquarie Warrants in Singapore, told The Business Times.\n\nMs Chung said the lack of interest in the underlying stock, and consequently its warrant, is \"disappointing\", especially since Macquarie expected that POSH, being owned by Malaysia's richest man, Robert Kuok, would drive demand among investors.\n\nThe first warrant issued by Macquarie (code: U7OW), with an exercise price of $1.05, expires on Jan 2 next year while the second warrant (code: U7PW), with an exercise price of $1.20, expires on Feb 2 next year.\n\nMacquarie may cease the listing of warrants on POSH once the current warrants expire, Ms Chung revealed, if investor interest continues to be muted.\n\n\"Even before the expiry date, if the shares move up by about 10 or 20 per cent and if we believe we need coverage on the up-side, we will renew issuance and list more POSH warrants, maybe of a different strike as well as expiry.\"\n\nMs Chung said that the lack of investor interest in POSH puzzles her given the strong fundamentals in the offshore & marine sector, including stable oil prices in recent years.\n\nOther offshore & marine stocks that recently listed have fared much better, quashing any suggestion that investors may be avoiding new listings in the sector.\n\nPacific Radiance, for instance, which made its debut on the Singapore Exchange in November, closed at nearly 11 per cent higher than its opening price on its first day of trading. The stock's price has risen more than 18 per cent since its IPO.\n\nAnother offshore & marine stock, Kim Heng Offshore & Marine, surged by as much as 28 per cent on the first day of its trading on Jan 22.\n\nOne may argue that a muted market is to blame. After all, trading of shares on the SGX in April fell 9.2 per cent from the month before.\n\nBut QT Vascular, which started trading on the SGX Catalist on April 29 - only four days after POSH - with an IPO price of 28 cents, has seen its share price surge by more than 25 per cent during this period.\n\nAn analyst who covers stocks in the sector, and who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that there could be two factors underpinning investor caution in POSH. Firstly, the valuation of POSH could be too high. Investors could also be waiting for the company to sign some contracts that may increase their confidence in the stock.\n\nVincent Fernando, an analyst at Religare Capital Markets in Singapore, said the stock's valuation and IPO pricing could be the reasons for its lacklustre performance.\n\n\"I think one reason for the price stagnation is that the IPO was priced too aggressively during marketing, and in the end investors only agreed to come in at the bottom end of the IPO pricing range, as I understand,\" he said.\n\n\"This doesn't bode well for market sentiment once the IPO trades, since it creates the message that there isn't much demand at higher price levels.\n\n\"It's better to price the deal less aggressively and then have demand hit the top end of the range, making a strong post-IPO market performance much more likely.\"\n\nMr Fernando said another problem is that the company's valuation is very much a function of its 2015 growth story and the accommodation vessel market. He added that the dynamics of this valuation needs to be better clarified and explained to the market.\n\n\"Size and name aren't enough to perform. Market education and pre-IPO strategy are important as well,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite intensive multilateral search efforts, which are now focused on the Indian Ocean, no sign of wreckage has been found so far.\n\nData from Inmarsat's network helped to identify the flight path of MH370 - which is said to have flown south towards the Indian Ocean after turning around - and narrow search operations to a stretch of the ocean west of Australia.\n\n\"Because of the universal nature of existing Inmarsat aviation services, our proposals can be implemented right away on all ocean-going commercial aircraft using equipment that is already installed,\" said chief executive Rupert Pearce. \"This offer responsibly, quickly and at little or no cost to the industry addresses in part the problem brought to light by the recent tragic events around MH370.\"\n\nThe service is being offered to 11,000 passenger aircraft already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, which essentially covers the global long-haul commercial fleet.\n\nIn addition, Inmarsat will offer both an enhanced position-reporting facility to support reduced in-flight aircraft separation as well as a \"black box in the cloud\" service, where historic and real-time flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder information can be streamed from an aircraft to aviation safety bodies. In the case of the cloud service, this could be triggered by certain occurrences, such as if the plane deviates from its course.\n\nCosts have been cited as one reason airlines might have opted to do without satellite tracking in the past.\n\nAccording to a BBC report, London- headquartered Inmarsat will bear the cost of the tracking service, which will come at a price tag of US$3 million per year.\n\n\"In the wake of the loss of MH370, we believe this is simply the right thing to do,\" said Mr Pearce, adding that Inmarsat was confident the proposals would represent a \"major contribution\" to boosting global aviation safety standards.\n\nOther suggestions which have been put forward to prevent the recurrence of such an incident include the European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) proposal to enable the plane's underwater locating devices to last up to 90 days. At present, they work up to 30 days.\n\nEASA has also proposed that the minimum recording duration of the cockpit voice recorder be raised to 20 hours, up from just two hours now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It comes down to the banking complexities, which have held up cargoes for a number of suppliers.\"\n\nSeveral trade sources point to growing difficulties opening letters of credit, vital to ensuring smooth delivery of goods. \"Western banks are unwilling to get involved,\" a second European trade source said. \"As soon as the banks see the word 'Iran' in the paperwork, you get it rejected.\"\n\nBankers and government officials said Western lenders are steering clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, fearing they could be penalised under US sanctions. \"We still cannot open letters of credit,\" said one Iranian government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"International banks are concerned about - or let's say afraid of - doing business with Iran,\" the official added. \"And we don't know what the solution will be. Dozens of ships are waiting at the ports and we just can't do anything.\"\n\nReuters ship tracking data shows that five panamax-sized vessels, each capable of carrying 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of grain, reached Iran in early April from ports in Europe, Australia and South America. The vessels were still located around Bandar Imam Khomeini and Bandar Abbas on May 9, several weeks after they should have been able to discharge a cargo.\n\n\"Having a panamax at port for that long would suggest to me there has been a payment issue,\" said a Sydney commodities trader. \"There have been some issues with Iran in the past.\"\n\nThe five cargoes would represent nearly 2 per cent of Iran's estimated annual wheat consumption of around 17 million tonnes.\n\nShip tracking data indicated that other vessels may also have been disrupted in recent months. Four panamax-sized vessels left Australia for Iran at the end of January.\n\nAfter arriving in Iranian waters in mid- to late February, the vessels were stuck mainly around Bandar Imam Khomeini until they departed in April. A spokesman at agribusiness group Cargill's Australia office said three panamaxes it had been involved with had been delayed due to port congestion in Iran.\n\nA separate panamax vessel originating in Ukraine was also stuck in Iran for weeks until April. A further three smaller vessels, including one carrying raw sugar, were also held up for weeks, ship tracking data showed.\n\nA European trade source said at least one or two cargoes had been re-routed to other buyers: \"The shipments in question were stuck in Iran for a long time and clocked up a big loss,\" the source said. \"They were subsequently traded to other buyers.\"\n\nA second Iranian government official said ships were waiting with perishable goods: \"A few have had to return to the country that we purchased goods from. Various factors are involved - like Iran not facilitating the delivery and also the banking problems.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for US agribusiness company Archer Daniels Midland, which has supplied Iran, said many international banks would not participate in transactions with Iran \"for fear of being sanctioned or fined\".\n\n\"Another hindrance is Iran's foreign currency controls,\" she added. \"Ships arriving in Iran with grain must frequently wait weeks for the Central Bank of Iran to approve the release of funds to pay for the cargo.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

While common wisdom at the turn of this year suggested that both equities and long-term yields should trade higher, developed stock markets have so far stalled while commodities or India's and Indonesia's (two out of the so called \"Fragile 5\") exchange markets posted the best performances year-to-date. Even less expected is the behaviour of US long-term interest rates, which fell from 3 per cent at the end of December to a 2014 low of 2.58 per cent on May 2.\n\nLike many, we advocated that equities were the best space to be this year and, despite a shaky start, we still think so. Unlike many, we were and remain supportive on emerging equities as a whole and Asia in particular. Our risk on global commodity exposures at the end of 2013 has been rewarded and we were among the few who didn't fear another repeat of last year's correction in global bond markets when initial tapering discussions took place. This explains - in part - the relatively significant exposure of our portfolios to fixed income in general, and credit and duration risks in particular. The main reason lies in the way we map out our portfolio construction and asset allocation for the benefit of our clients.\n\nGlobal growth suffered from a sharp slowdown in the first three months of 2014, weighing on corporate results and equity performances. The US experienced a temporary downturn worsened by unusual weather conditions and growth in many emerging economies continued to slow under a combination of monetary tightening and structural rebalancing towards less leveraged, less investment and export-driven economic structures.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Pre-election opinion polls and post-voting exit polls both have a patchy record.\n\nMr Modi, of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has dominated the lengthy contest with a media-savvy campaign that has hinged on vows to kick-start India's economy and create jobs.\n\nYet much depends on Mr Modi winning enough seats to form a stable government that will allow him to push through his promised reforms.\n\nIndia's staggered voting, spread over five weeks to reach the country's 815 million voters and move security forces around its varied terrain, ended yesterday. Results are due on Friday.\n\nResearch group C-Voter predicted 289 seats for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) headed by the BJP, with just 101 seats for the alliance led by the Congress party - which would be the ruling party's worst-ever result. C-Voter said its poll was based on a sample of 166,901 randomly selected respondents in all 543 seats up for election. The pollster said its margin of error is +\\-3 per cent at a national level.\n\nAnother poll, by Cicero for the India Today group, showed the NDA hitting between 261 and 283 seats. A majority of 272 is needed to form a government, although that is often achieved with outside support from regional parties.\n\nSeveral national exit polls overestimated the BJP's seat share in the last two general elections in 2004 and 2009. The ruling Congress party went on to form coalition governments on both occasions. \"We will only know if this 'Modi wave' has really happened after the election results,\" said Praveen Rai, a political analyst at the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), who published a report on exit polls last month.\n\nIndia's stock markets have in recent days hit record highs on hopes that the exit polls would show the BJP and its allies winning a majority.\n\nThe Nifty breached the psychologically key level of 7,000 points for the first time yesterday, breaking a record high of 6,871.35 that it hit last Friday. The benchmark BSE Sensex also hit an all-time high and the rupee rallied to its strongest levels in 10 months yesterday.\n\nBut in a sign of the immense economic challenges that the new government would be facing, the country's consumer-price inflation quickened in April while factory output declined, adding pressure on the central bank to keep rates elevated. The consumer-price index rose 8.59 per cent from a year earlier, compared with 8.31 per cent in March, the Central Statistics Office said in New Delhi yesterday. The median of 39 estimates in a Bloomberg survey predicted an 8.5 per cent rise. Industrial production shrank 0.5 per cent in March, a separate report showed, compared with an estimated 1.5 per cent fall.\n\n\"The new government will be inheriting a stagflation-type situation,\" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai.\n\n\"Despite the contraction in output, the central bank will be forced to keep rates high due to inflation. The government has to lower subsidies and raise spending on energy, roads and ports to boost the economy.\"\n\nShould Mr Modi fall short of a majority when the results come in on May 16, he will need to strike a coalition deal with some of India's increasingly powerful regional parties.

Officials are now more optimistic the industry will take the lead with the help of a common strategy between regulators.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents nearly all long-haul airlines, said in April that it would set up a special task force on the issue of tracking.\n\nOfficials say that jets can be tracked with hardware available for less than US$100,000 and updates can be transmitted using existing technology, though the cost depends on the frequency of updates.\n\nOther more simple options include embedding GPS tracking devices in aircraft, but these could require safety certification and there are no common safety standards. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Theories on what happened include a terror act, rogue pilot action, and mechanical problems.\n\nNo significant legal moves have yet been made as families closely monitor an immensely difficult search in vast ocean depths that has so far found nothing.\n\n\"When there is no cause identified, it is hard to see how the airline has or has not shown the absence of fault,\" said Alan Tan, a professor of aviation law at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n\nThe size of any damages would depend on where lawsuits are filed.\n\nNext-of-kin can file in the country where an airline is based, where tickets were purchased, where the passengers were headed or where they lived.\n\nSince most passengers were from China or Malaysia, most cases could be filed in the two countries, where courts are more conservative in awarding damages than in countries like the United States.\n\nDamages are typically based on the lost lifetime earnings of a victim and thus could total in the hundreds of millions for all passengers combined.\n\n\"In the US, settlements usually are in the US$1-3 million range. For Malaysians or Chinese, salaries are lower, and hence, recoveries will be lower,\" said Paul Stephen Dempsey, director of the Institute of Air and Space Law at Canada's McGill University.\n\nA US law firm is already planning a \"multi-million- dollar\" lawsuit against Malaysia Airlines and aircraft maker Boeing, on behalf of an Indonesian passenger's family.\n\nBut legal experts said few cases will likely end up in court. They expect undisclosed out-of-court settlements between families and Malaysia Airlines and its lead insurer, German giant Allianz.\n\nThis would allow the loss-making carrier - which was struggling amid intense competition even before MH370 disappeared - to quietly lay the matter to rest and focus on rebuilding its image.\n\n\"Because of its unprecedented nature, the courts are going to look at (MH370) very carefully. That is something the airline will try to avoid unless settlement expectations from the victims' families are perceived by Malaysia Airlines as unreasonable,\" said Mr Joseph, the Malaysian attorney Joseph.\n\nAdded NUS's Prof Tan: \"This avoids court uncertainties and protracted litigation, and most claims will end up being negotiated and settled this way, particularly those outside the US.\"\n\nIn the case of Air France flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic with 228 people aboard in June 2009, the airline's insurers made compensation payments to relatives.\n\nOnly a small number of lawsuits were filed, with a Brazilian court awarding one family an equivalent of more than half a million US dollars, before its flight data recorders were recovered in 2011.\n\nA combination of mechanical failure and pilot error was eventually blamed.\n\nAllianz would bear the brunt of any payouts for MH370, sparing the already financially struggling airline.\n\nMalaysia Airlines told AFP its insurance coverage is adequate for all eventualities, declining to give details. But experts said the carrier will likely face higher future premiums.\n\nCourts are considered unlikely to apportion any blame to Boeing, engine manufacturer Rolls Royce, or other parties without evidence implicating them.\n\nAlleging incompetence and secrecy by Malaysia's government and the airline, about 300 next-of-kin have already banded together to press for answers.\n\nMalaysia Airlines has begun making some payouts to families under an \"advance compensation process\" but has declined to reveal details.\n\nLawsuits must be filed within two years of an accident. Families are holding off for now as they await news on the search, seeking confirmation of a crash, and emotional closure.\n\n\"If today someone cut off your limb, can you buy your limb back?\" Yik-Kiong Hue, an MH370 next-of-kin, said in an email to AFP. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

This is where the big growth will come from in the future, said Mr Charan, driven by demographics and investment flows.\n\nHe noted that the South is reshaping entire industries. For example, China today is the largest producer of cars - bigger than the US, Japan or Europe.\n\nThe appliance industry will also be reshaped by China. India is likely to continue to be a leader in the software industry.\n\nThe South also has some impressive companies with global reach, including the Tata Group of India, Embraer and 3G Capital of Brazil (which owns Burger King, Anheuser Busch and Heinz, among various large brands), and China's appliance maker Haier.\n\nThe rise of the South also impacts the way companies are organised, he pointed out. GE realised the shifting centre of gravity and moved some of its most senior executives to Hong Kong, including its vice- chairman John Rice.\n\nIn future, companies will need to source more senior local talent from the developing world, adjust their pay scales in these countries to match global pay scales and also job titles. Companies will also need to make shifts in resource allocation, Southwards.\n\nTechnological trends also bear close watching, according to Mr Charan - in particular, digitisation. He noted that the cost of telecommunications and data processing is cheap and falling, the mobile revolution is well advanced and moving further - with the imminence of 5G and the use of algorithms, cloud computing and sensors are becoming ubiquitous in industry after industry.\n\n\"If your company is not leveraging on digitisation, take a closer look at it,\" he said. Companies that resisted or delayed digitisation or tried to act defensively have lost out, including Barnes and Noble and Borders in books, Target in clothing, Kodak in photography and many others.\n\nDigitisation is affecting entire industries, he said. \"CEOs need to stop looking at just their own companies and also look at their industry.\" They need to ask themselves how it is going to change, and whether it is in danger of being disintermediated or swallowed.\n\nThey must also bear in mind that their companies can be challenged by players from outside their industry. When it comes to planning, they must be prepared to plan flexibly. \"Change can come from anywhere at any time. The market isn't going to wait for your planning cycle,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to leadership, much is said about the need to be visionary, decisive and strategic. But there are some qualities that are not emphasised enough, according to Mr Charan.\n\nOne is dealing with uncertainty; the best leaders figure out how to do this and even use uncertainty as a wave to ride on, he said.\n\nAnother underappreciated quality is having a deep understanding of how governments work. Governments can be important to companies, not only as regulators and policymakers but also as partners. Ideally, a CEO should have spent at least three years in areas where he or she had to deal with governments.\n\nFocusing on people is also underrated, according to Mr Charan. \"Remember, it's people who create value and people who compete, not companies,\" he said.\n\nCEOs should pay serious attention to recruitment. \"Never say 'he has no degrees' or 'he can't speak English properly'. A lot of skills can be acquired. Look at the quality of the raw material.\"\n\nHe added that companies also need to build a \"people pipeline\" which will help them create opportunities. \"Before you make any major investment, have the people in place to lead and manage it,\" he said.\n\nWhen assessing a CEO, Mr Charan pointed out that there are three questions he always asks himself. \"One is: how does this person deal with complexity? Another is: who are the people he or she has selected, and what is their batting average? And third: has this person 'arrived' or will he or she continue to learn?\"\n\nMr Charan also advised companies on how to deal with longer-gestation investments. Many great companies have large investments in areas that will not generate revenues in the short term.\n\nFor example, e-commerce giant Amazon is investing heavily in new distribution centres which will not earn returns immediately. Its profits have not been impressive, but its stock price has nevertheless performed strongly. Other companies such as GE and United Technology also have substantial investments in areas which will not yield short-term returns.\n\nMr Charan said these \"growth investments\" should be separated from investments that yield current returns and be organised as individual projects. \"Review them separately and put your best people people to lead them,\" he said. \"And then communicate your growth investments to your investors; show them that there is something at the end of the rainbow.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The court reinstated a jury's 2012 finding that Google infringed the copyrights, and sent the case back to let Google argue it had fair use of the technology.\n\nOracle had sought more than US$1 billion in damages, claiming Google used Java code without paying because it was in a rush to create Android, which has become the world's most popular smartphone platform. The case divided the industry between companies that write interface code and those that rely on it to develop software programs.\n\nGoogle said that the ruling \"sets a damaging precedent for computer science and software development\". The company is considering its options, said Matt Kallman, a spokesman.\n\n\"A set of commands to instruct a computer to carry out desired operations may contain expression that is eligible for copyright protection,\" Circuit Judge Kathleen O'Malley wrote for the three-judge panel. \"An original work - even one that serves a function - is entitled to copyright protection as long as the author had multiple ways to express the underlying idea.\"\n\nThe dispute centred on application programming interfaces, or APIs, code that lets programmers take advantage of functions already built into an operating system, such as securing data or communicating with other devices. Developers using Java would not have to create a new formula for those features.\n\nSun Microsystems Inc, which created Java in the mid-1990s, allowed it to be freely available to developers, though it had a pricing structure for when the code was used for commercial purposes. Oracle agreed to buy Sun in 2009 for US$7.4 billion and sued Google a year later.\n\nGoogle said that the code constitutes fundamental programming interfaces used by the entire industry for free. It accused Oracle of trying to backpedal on Sun pledges that Java would remain free.\n\nThe debate centred in part on where the line is drawn between software that's eligible for copyright protection and what is not.\n\nThe application programming interfaces act similarly to a plug that lets one program interact with another and \"there shouldn't be copyright protection for the shape of the plugs\", said Jonathan Band, a Washington-based copyright lawyer who filed legal arguments on behalf of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which sided with Google.\n\nHe said that the ruling could mean increased prices, such as for programmers who develop applications for mobile devices.\n\nThe Federal Circuit, which specialises in patent law, heard the case because Oracle also claimed patent infringement.

With 90 per cent of the companies in the S&P 500 on the books, it looks as though Q1 earnings rose by 5 per cent.\n\nNow, US Federal Reserve officials and strategists are describing an economy coming out of hibernation and ready to release its pent-up energy. Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher predicted a \"dramatic snapback\" in growth in the second quarter, according to Dow Jones Newswires.\n\n\"We believe that the Federal Reserve must share our constructive view on the underlying strength of the US economy and is looking past the brutal winter and its deleterious impact on first-quarter gross domestic product,\" said Phil Orlando at fund manager Federated Investors.\n\nWeekly jobless claims fell back to levels last seen in March before talk of an economic slowdown began in earnest. Between the weekly and monthly data, the labour market now appears to be in its healthiest state since before the financial crisis.\n\nSimilarly, a survey of the services sector by the Institute for Supply Management dispelled fears about a slowdown in the stores, car showrooms and call centres that are the heart of the US economy. This week will provide more evidence of how economic behaviour changed once the snows melted, with industrial production data and two key housing reports.\n\nFriday's report from the US Commerce Department on housing starts is particularly important as it guides investors on the outlook for home construction.\n\n\"With heightened concern over the weakening housing market, this report will help assess the strength of housing as we go into the all-important spring selling season,\" said Quincy Krosby at Prudential Financial.\n\nThe rotation out of the glitzy growth stocks that have led the market for most of the last five years and into old-line value stocks continued last week. Even with the Dow at record highs, indexes of small capitalisation and growth stocks are still in the red for the year to date.\n\nCompanies such as Twitter and health data processor Athenahealth - companies that could do no wrong in 2013 - have hardly seen a break in the selling since March. With the notable exception of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, most of the big deals recently have involved blue chips.\n\nThere is Pfizer's US$100 billion-plus bid for British drug giant AstraZeneca; nuclear power producer Exelon's agreement to buy fellow East-Coast utility Pepco; and General Electric's deal to take over Alstom's energy business for US$13.5 billion.\n\nApple struck a US$3.2 billion deal to buy Beats headphone company which allows Apple to retain some of its growth stock cache, but the dividend decision aligns it with the interests of investors who are seeking value stocks.\n\nWhy have stock traders become so conservative, even as economists grow more optimistic about US growth?\n\nThe bears point to pernicious issues with the broader economy such as wage growth that has stagnated for so long.\n\nThen there is the question of rising borrowing rates. So far, interest rates have hardly stirred despite the Fed's gradual retreat from stimulus policies. At some point, the Treasury market will have to adjust to the reality of a central bank shifting into rate hiking mode.\n\nThe paradox of the 2014 stock market is, the rosier the growth outlook, the sooner that moment of reckoning may come. That's why investors are likely to stick with the blue chips better equipped to ride out a spike in rates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The country is Super Group's largest market for the branded consumer division.\n\nFor its food ingredient division - which manufactures soluble coffee powders and non-dairy creamers for other beverage makers - lower sales into Indonesia was only partially offset by higher sales into markets in the East Asia region.\n\nThe firm said it is monitoring the developments in Thailand, and \"will take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact\" on its businesses.\n\nIt added that fluctuations in raw material costs and currencies would affect the group's operating performance, and expected market conditions to \"remain competitive\" in the next 12 months.\n\nCommodity prices, particularly those for robusta coffee beans, sugar and crude palm oil - key ingredients for Super's instant beverages - have risen over the first quarter.\n\n\"Rising raw material costs will affect the F&B industry and the group's operating performance.

Some of the companies in preparation are not ready to tap the market,\" said OCBC head of corporate finance Tay Toh Sin.\n\nListings of real estate investment trusts (Reits) have dived this year as investors turn from yield income towards capital growth.\n\nInstitutional investors have moved out their allocation for yield-driven stocks, and the lower popularity of Reits among investors has led to the IPO market slowdown in the first quarter, said HSBC head of Southeast Asia equity capital markets Matthew Song.\n\nTrust listings, and in particular that of Reits, have dominated the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in recent years, with seven contributing 79 per cent, or US$4.09 billion, of the total US$5.2 billion raised in the Singapore IPO market last year, Dealogic data showed.\n\nSo far this year, there has been only one. The OUE Commercial Reit, which raised $346.4 million in the first Singapore IPO this year, has been trading underwater since listing at 80 cents a share.\n\nA smaller appetite for Reits, a volatile market and more demanding investors have also contributed to the flat IPO market after January, when four companies were floated.\n\n\"The IPO market has been relatively quiet in the first quarter of this year due to market volatility and also a mismatch in valuation expectation between issuers and investors, causing some deals to be deferred,\" said Tan Jeh Wuan, DBS head of Singapore capital markets.\n\nLotte Shopping Co Ltd, the largest shopping mall owner in South Korea, confirmed reports last week when it said that it was delaying a US$1 billion Reit listing due to unfavourable market conditions. It may reconsider IPO plans if market conditions improve, but is now looking at a sale-and-leaseback deal through a Korean public real estate fund as an alternative, Reuters reported.\n\nTrust listings that are expected to come to the market in the next few months will feature new types of assets, marking an evolution in the trust market here.\n\nLarsen and Toubro, one of India's largest construction firms, is said to have started its pre-marketing exercise to gauge investor demand for a US$800 million listing of its toll roads.\n\nIt has yet to fix a date for the IPO launch partly because of ongoing elections in India, the results of which may affect the listing. The firm received approval from the SGX late last month, and will have to list the trust within three months.\n\nKeppel Telecommunications and Transportation (T&T) has also indicated plans to list a $500 million data centre trust. Despite the departure of several senior executives in recent weeks, including its CEO Pang Hee Hon, this has not changed, the firm said in response to a Business Times article on the resignations last Thursday.\n\nFor these new types of trusts to succeed, the quality of the assets, the reputation of the sponsor and the education process will be critical, said bankers.\n\n\"Business trusts and Reits that have a good portfolio of assets with a reputable sponsor will generally be well received,\" said UBS head of investment banking Choo Oi Yee. \"As the issuers diversify in terms of subsectors, it will be key to educate the market about these new subsectors.\"\n\nLooking ahead, there may be more asset portfolios from India, or even Europe, in trust listings, she added.\n\nAnother IPO that is expected to come in the second quarter is a $600 million hospitality Reit by Frasers Centrepoint, the property development and investment company that spun off from Fraser and Neave.\n\nDespite muted demand, new trust listings can still be successful with the right structure and target investors, said HSBC's Mr Song.\n\n\"The key is to target institutional investors who will focus on the asset quality, stability of dividend flows and total return expectations of the trust,\" he said. \"Importantly, having the right debt structure will also help with the success of trust listings as institutional investors prefer trusts with a longer debt tenor amidst a rising rate environment.\"\n\nIn the meantime, privatisation deals, which have involved mainly property companies so far, may pick up in other sectors.\n\nSaid OCBC's Ms Tay: \"I won't say (the privatisation action) is just limited to property. (The companies) look at it, and if they're not getting a lot of bandwidth from the listing status and are being undervalued by investors, (they would think) it probably is better to privatise it.\"\n\nIn recent months, CapitaMalls Asia, Singapore Land and Chemoil Energy have received takeover bids to delist the firms from SGX. Offers have also been made for hospitality firms Hotel Properties and LCD Global Investments as well as Olam International, which may be taken private if the public float falls below 10 per cent.\n\nAccess to inexpensive debt means more such privatisation offers may come.\n\n\"Companies that have a view that the market is not valuing its equity at a fair multiple have been encouraged to consider selling or privatising, especially with the availability of liquidity - both bank financing as well as other sources of capital such as private equity funds,\" said UBS's Ms Choo.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This follows recent warnings from other weather agencies that there is a good chance of an El Nino.\n\nEl Nino, which develops every two to seven years, occurs when water warms around Indonesia, shifts eastwards and rises to the surface in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe warming water changes wind patterns and draws rain and thunderstorms towards South America and away from countries in the western Pacific. It typically brings floods to usually arid countries in western South America and drought to Indonesia and other countries in the region.\n\nIf this year's El Nino is as strong as the 20th century's worst in 1997-98, which was blamed for tens of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damage, it could wreak havoc on palm oil crops, analysts fear.\n\nFadhil Hasan, executive director of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, said that production was hit in 2008 following an El Nino, and prices rose to US$1,200 a tonne. They are currently at around US$930 a tonne.\n\nHowever, he said that other factors, such as market speculation, may have also contributed to the price rise.\n\nAlan Lim, a palm oil plantation analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank in Malaysia, said that in the worst case scenario, an El Nino could cause a 30 per cent drop in production in the top two producers.\n\nHe said that production would be hit some six to 12 months after El Nino, meaning in 2015.\n\nObservers also warn that a steep rise in palm oil prices could boost alternative products, especially soyabean oil, which is mainly from crops grown in the United States and Brazil.\n\nDespite the growing concerns, some industry players and analysts downplayed the dangers and were optimistic that palm oil would stay ahead of its competitors even during a sustained period of drought.\n\nA greater source of pressure on the industry may continue to be the sustained campaigns from green groups, who are calling for palm oil to be produced in a sustainable fashion that does not destroy any more rainforest.

The purchase was funded by a one-for-one stock rights offering in April and a bridge loan from DBS Group and Rabobank International.\n\nThe acquisition sent its debt level soaring, causing it to face potential downgrades by credit rating agencies and leading it to take steps to enhance its capital structure and deployment.\n\nIts gearing ratio is expected to improve over the next two years. \"The successful completion of the refinancing of the Group's bridge loan into a four-year term loan has improved our credit profile,\" said Ng Joo Siang, chairman of Pard and group managing director of China Fishery.\n\nThe group also cautioned that if El Nino were to develop later this year, it would have an impact on anchovy catch in Peruvian waters. \"There are indications that the current catch in Peru is lower than anticipated, which may or may not indicate the early signs of El Nino,\" it said, adding that it would continue to monitor the situation.\n\nShares in Pard ended 0.2 cent lower at 11.9 cents, while China Fishery's shares closed one cent lower at 37 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This, Mr Roberts says, sets \"the new gold standard\" for IT performance.\n\n\"Today, the litmus test for whether or not a network infrastructure is doing its job properly is how happy your consumers are with the services,\" he said.\n\nOne of the drivers behind this paradigm shift is the fact that technologies like virtualisation and cloud computing are having real financial and commercial implications for businesses, putting paid to the notion that IT operations are mere \"cost centres\" for companies.\n\nThis has prompted more business owners and CEOs to, in conjunction with their IT teams, actively make IT-related decisions and change their focus.\n\nMr Roberts notes that the IT department has always been viewed as a pretty significant cost centre in most organisations. \"Now . . . executives are interested in whether IT can be a profit centre for them.\"\n\nFluke Networks, for its own part, has used IT capabilities to streamline its operations.\n\nThe company now delivers its network infrastructure measurement, management and troubleshooting services in the form of a monthly subscription-based Software-as-a- Service (SaaS) solution for its clients, improving its operational efficiency and profit margins.\n\nMr Roberts adds that Fluke Networks also puts the consumer experience first with its Application- Aware Network Performance Management (AANPM) solution.\n\nAn industry first, AANPM was designed to create synergies between the network structure teams and application structure teams of companies so as to focus their IT services on the consumer experience, instead of each team's individual key performance indexes.\n\n\"IT has become a broker of services, if you will. IT is now the sub-organisation that is on the hook for delivering new services holistically to end-users,\" he said.\n\nDespite the ongoing trend, Mr Roberts said that companies are still too slow in adopting this consumer- first mentality.\n\nIn his opinion, 80 per cent of the businesses he has interacted with have not fundamentally made that shift. A similar percentage of Singaporean firms, he believes, have also yet to make that change in mindset.\n\nThis anaemic pace of change is creating a huge burden for IT, as companies seeking to remedy their end-user problems would, without the right approach, be wasting large amounts of resources buying even the latest of enterprise IT software.\n\n\"What they're doing is throwing more money, more tools, more resources into these isolated buckets - when what they don't realise is that you should be looking at this from a singular viewpoint of end-user experience,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Or because the banks were among the prime movers, it could have been an unwinding of short-term positions which were taken to capitalise on better-than-expected bank earnings last week.\n\nIn any case, traders were at a loss to explain the selling which - if it is any consolation - came in low volume of 1.8 billion units worth $1.2 billion. Excluding warrants, there were 187 rises versus 243 falls.\n\nBrokers were stumped as to why the STI was as weak as it was, particularly since Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index finished 1.8 per cent firmer after news there of a raft of capital market reforms.\n\nDBS, which traded ex-dividend yesterday, led the banks and STI lower with a 43-cent decline to $16.65 that came with 4.5 million done and sliced almost nine points off the index. UOB, whose rise to near all-time highs had led the banks and the STI higher last week, fell 45 cents or 2 per cent to $22 with 5.4 million traded.\n\nElsewhere in the index, the Jardine group was weak and Keppel Corp dropped five cents to $10.62 on volume of 3.1 million. In its daily newsletter yesterday, Macquarie Warrants reminded traders that Macquarie Equities Research had an \"outperform\" on Keppel with a 12-month price target of $13.\n\nIn the transport sector, SIA, which recently reported an operating loss, saw its shares lose just one cent to $10.20 with 1.7 million traded.\n\nIn its \"hold\" on SIA, OCBC Investment Research said it expected intense competition to depress the airline's operating profit.\n\n\"While the outlook is relatively stable for the parent company and SIAEC (engineering company), we expect operating losses to continue at SIA Cargo and Tigerair, and earnings to be volatile for SilkAir,\" said the broker, which maintained its $9.50 fair value.\n\nIn the penny segment, shares in China water treatment play HanKore Environment bounced 0.7 cent or 8 per cent to 9.5 cents with 483.5 million traded after the stock at the end of last week weakened sharply on news that its reverse takeover partner, China Everbright, was one of the state-owned enterprises under scrutiny for corruption.\n\nHanKore, which yesterday also said it was likely to report a loss for Q3 FY2014 and 9M FY2014 due to the accounting of an acquisition and the fair value loss on certain warrants, probably owed its recovery to reassurances from OSK DMG and Maybank Kim Eng.\n\nOSK said the accounting items did not affect the company's cashflows and expected HanKore to report a decent operational performance of about 135 million yuan (S$27 million) for the current financial year, excluding accounting losses from the above which should come up to about 114 million yuan.\n\n\"We maintain that even if the China Everbright deal does not go through, HanKore deserves at least 15x FY15F P/E in a normalised cycle without state backing,\" said OSK. \"This works out to 9.7 cents.\"\n\nMKE said it was \"not worried as it is purely accounting adjustments with zero impact on cash flows\" and recommended that investors focus on HanKore's core operations.\n\n\"The market appears to have written off the CEI deal. In our view, current share price weakness presents a good buying opportunity,\" said MKE, reiterating its 17-cent target price.\n\nOtto Marine was another company in the penny segment to issue a profit warning. In a statement over the weekend, it said it expected a first-quarter loss because of \"lower utilisation resulting from the docking of several vessels for survey as required by class rules on a periodic basis over a five-year cycle and the re-position and mobilisation of some other vessels.\" Its shares fell 0.7 cent or almost 9 per cent to 7.2 cents on volume of 53 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How do corporations ensure that their boards are broadly diverse?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, May 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFlorence Ng\n\nManaging Director, Founder\n\nStraits Talent Pte Ltd\n\nA DIVERSE team is a winning team. The best ideas and innovation often come out of left field. Diversity is the business of all corporate boards striving to succeed and stay ahead of their competitors. Gender diversity is part of this equation. That said, corporations need to value true diversity - which includes age, functional experience, industry knowhow, geographic and cultural differences, view-points, and so the list goes on.\n\nThe reason there is a dearth of women on corporate boards is clear - there are not enough of them in C-level positions to begin with. They often pass up on being ''CXO'' at work, and choose to become ''CDO'' (aka Chief Domestic Officer) at home. The pool of female talent available for board appointments is limited, to say the least. The fix for this is a lengthy and continuous exercise. Corporations, regulatory bodies and individuals alike all need to appreciate and support family-friendly measures so as to build a pipeline of capable womenfolk in key leadership positions. In time, they will form the gradually enlarged pool of talent for board appointments.\n\nAnne Tong\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nHSR International Realtors Pte Ltd\n\nTHE role of corporate boards should primarily be to oversee the strategic direction of the company, facilitate effective decision-making and drive overall growth, among other functions. Ensuring gender diversity should not be a priority. What is imperative is to ensure good representation of diverse talents and views from individuals who are able to contribute.\n\nWhile it is advisable for companies to be aware of the small percentage of female board directors and to perhaps consider this group should there be a position on the board to fill, gender diversity should not be mandated. Having women on the board solely for the sake of fulfilling a quota would be meaningless. However, in the case of companies which produce goods and services targeted at families, or customer service- and relationship-building industries, I believe exercising gender diversity would be an advantage as the board could benefit from female perspectives. Diversity can come in various other forms. Corporations can ensure diversity through a board made up of individuals with a range of experience, expertise, knowledge, talents and exposure to different markets.\n\nTim Moylan\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nInfor\n\nSINGAPORE is an attractive location for companies to establish their regional headquarters, largely because of the country's diverse workforce which provides a wealth of perspectives and experiences to company decision-makers. As Singapore continues to position itself as an innovation and regional HQ hub, the value that a diverse management team brings to the workplace should be further recognised and promoted. Whether mandated or not, leaders of successful enterprises understand that employee and management team diversity - gender, cultural background, nationality, experiences, etc - supports a culture of greater innovation and helps companies adapt in today's globally competitive business environment.\n\nFor example, while the tech industry has been traditionally known as a boys' club, today we are embracing female leadership in the industry and moving conversations beyond traditional stereotypes. Female leaders in the tech world are driving companies forward as part of C-Suite leadership. Enterprises should continue to promote and support female leadership, as a diverse management team brings valuable ideas and different perspectives, and that's crucial to success.\n\nStefanie Yuen Thio\n\nJoint Managing Director\n\nTSMP Law Corporation\n\nTHE business of boards is not to ensure gender diversity. Their job is to manage the business of the company well. And of course every company is different so we should not expect to see uniform boards. But if you find a preponderance of company boards with only men (less than 8 per cent of directors are women), then surely you have to ask yourself: Are we really getting the best people on our boards? Statistically, it's not likely that less than 8 per cent of our top-calibre people are female. In which case, our business world needs to consider if it has tapped the available talent pool for the most capable individuals. And if study after study shows that diversity makes for a stronger board, then surely it's silly, and possibly irresponsible, to ignore them.\n\nThat said, I am firmly against quotas and other hard positive discrimination measures. Singapore is one of the most, if not the most, gender-equal places to work. Women can climb to the top of their careers on the basis of sheer merit, hard work and smarts. Having a quota for women on boards would be tokenism and would devalue what every woman executive has worked so hard to achieve. It would be putting a sexist glass ceiling where one never existed before.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nTHERE are generally two schools of thought to promote diversity - one involves affirmative actions in the form of regulations and the other leaves it to market forces or natural course of events. While we observe that regulators tend to favour a ''light touch'' approach, it would probably be more effective to let companies identify and recognise the value that such diversity could bring to their business, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nA lot has already been done to raise the awareness of gender diversity on boards in recent years. Most companies have a nomination committee (NC) for its board of directors. The challenge lies in finding adequate and suitable candidates who will add value to the board. For this reason, the NC needs to spread its wings to consider and evaluate a more diverse group of candidates who will best contribute to the needs of the business and organisation.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nGENDER diversity is vital for every workplace to ensure a balanced playing field. However, the picture-perfect snapshot of a completely equal breakdown of staff, gender-wise, is unrealistic. Gender diversity is a major talking point globally and the issue is slowly making progress, but how the issue is tackled isn't the responsibility of corporate boards. The lack of females in the boardroom is an issue that needs to be addressed by the various advocacy groups and governing bodies supporting the empowerment of women.\n\nWomen need to be recognised for their skills and talent, and introducing a quota will most certainly undermine them. The Code of Corporate Governance should make a number of recommendations that include developing female-focused development courses that empower and identify key talents. By identifying female candidates who want to progress further in their career, corporations can create a pool of talent that can be nurtured for future senior roles and board positions.\n\nWe must remember that women are often a key demographic for marketers; their point of view is incomparable. While there shouldn't be a quota as such, it is in the corporations' best interests to assess the gender balance of their workplace and their board. Is it too male-dominated? If so, who is representing the female points of view? It makes perfect business sense to have a more equal workforce.\n\nMen and women have different standpoints and market insights, which contribute to creating a holistic business outlook, leading to better-informed business decisions and performance.\n\n''Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; show him how to catch fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.'' It is our responsibility as a company to equip our female staff with the skillset and confidence to get into the boardroom on their own merits.\n\nChris Mead\n\nRegional Director\n\nHays in Singapore & Malaysia\n\nAS recruiting experts, we believe that gender diversity is the business of corporate boards. The business case has been corroborated overseas but despite this, Singapore still ranks poorly when it comes to gender diversity.\n\nRecruitment is about selecting the best person for the job and one of the biggest arguments against gender diversity is the merit argument. Of course the final recruitment decision should always be based on who possesses the most suitable skills and experience. But if there is not diversity in your application pool, how do you know you are selecting from the very best shortlist?\n\nTherefore improving Singapore's gender diversity starts with ensuring diversity in an applicant pool. Hiring managers will then select the very best shortlist, from which they can pick the very best person. Provided all candidates are considered equally, this will naturally lead to a diverse workforce.\n\nOther strategies include developing board-ready women through workplace flexibility, clear career paths and development opportunities.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN Amro Bank NV Singapore; and\n\nCEO of ABN Amro Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nGOOD decision-making on corporate boards requires hearing and considering different points of view, which can only come from members who have varied backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Studies have also shown that diversity on corporate boards is typically associated with more effective corporate governance and improved financial value.\n\nABN Amro is committed to diversity across our global operations and at every level of the organisation. We believe board diversity is necessary to help steer the board to make better and relevant decisions for our business where clients are equally diverse and wide-ranging. Having women on boards is one of the key ways to ensure diversity of thought and better stakeholder representation. Besides board-level gender representation, ABN Amro also strives to recruit and promote women to senior management positions. Our target for 2014 is to place women in 20 per cent of senior management positions, as well as in 25 per cent of upper middle-management positions.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B Icag Pte Ltd\n\nI HAVE been a board member of companies from the public and private sectors for over 30 years now. I subscribe to the principle of board appointments based on the candidate's suitability and not on gender. Based on this, more women who can add to the diversity of background, experience and expertise for the proper and effective functioning of boards should be appointed.\n\nAll things being equal, the gender mix of boards should reflect that of the population and working population. There is no reason why it is not so. I contend that much of the imbalance is due to the old boys' network of board appointments. Until this preference or practice is done away with, the status quo will continue for some time. Gender diversity should not be the business of corporate boards. I am for the soft approach to use persuasive power, perhaps even peer pressure, to redress the sharp gender imbalance. If this does not work, legislation or quotas should then be implemented to drive the change, to put more women on boards, as has been shown by some Scandinavian countries.\n\nIngrid Sidiadinoto\n\nManaging Director\n\nUPS Singapore\n\nBEING in the business of linking people, cultures and commerce, diversity has always been key to UPS. As a woman myself, I am proud to be part of a company that embraces values of inclusiveness and respect, and believes in ensuring equal opportunities for all.\n\nUPS is committed to nurturing our talents by providing various training programmes. In 2010, UPS Singapore was the first in Asia-Pacific to launch the Women's Leadership Development initiative. The programme targets not just women but all employees, women and men alike, by creating a holistic view at providing opportunities for all to develop leadership skills and connect personally and professionally. It appreciates the benefits of gender differences when solving problems, brainstorming and defining processes together.\n\nThe initiative aims to improve retention of women at managerial levels, develop women on the management team, and position UPS for future business growth opportunities with women entrepreneurs. It allows us to address the unique challenges women may have working in our industry, but more importantly ensures that we enrich our pipeline of talent for high-level positions, regardless of gender.\n\nVenkatraman Sheshashayee\n\nChief Executive Officer / Executive Director\n\nJaya Holdings Ltd\n\nWHILE I respect and appreciate the efforts of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) on all fronts and believe that SIAS is a force for good, this is one area where I must differ from their views. As a principle, affirmative action must be taken when there is a historic wrong that needs to be corrected. This action is taken with the objective of preventing the adverse outcomes of past actions to continue indefinitely into the future. Affirmative action also breaks existing paradigms and encourages positive change.\n\nSince time immemorial, women - by virtue of tradition, social mores and misinterpretations of texts - have been denied their place in the sun. They have been classed as weaker, manipulated into support roles, given lower status, and faced discrimination and suppression in diverse overt and covert ways. Discrimination based on race, colour or ethnicity has always been easy to recognise and condemn; gender discrimination is far more insidious and does not get much press. While progress has been made in bringing some balance, we still have a long way to go.\n\nMandated gender diversity, therefore, is an affirmative action that is needed, not just in Singapore, but across the world. Singapore can and should lead the way. We need to encourage gender diversity and gender sensitivity across the spectrum. While this must not be limited to corporate boards, the corporate world can lead by example. And there is a business case for doing so - research has proven, time and again, that companies with woman directors on their boards enjoy higher returns on equity, superior sales and lower attrition rates.\n\nI believe that, for a finite time-frame, boards must be incentivised to have woman directors. Existing directors must be incentivised to mentor and coach woman successors. Boards must be discouraged from using old-boy networks and encouraged to build rigorous procedures to identify, evaluate and choose directors. Senior woman professionals must be encouraged and incentivised to seek board positions, to stand up and insist on being counted. Existing woman directors, when retiring, must be replaced by other women.\n\nOrganisations such as SIAS can set up forums where professionals seeking board positions can register their interest to be considered as candidates. CEOs must encourage senior and middle-management woman employees to participate as observers in board meetings, so that they may learn and prepare themselves. These initiatives in themselves will not solve the issue, but will be steps in the right direction.\n\nAs for general diversity, that will follow - research has also proven that gender diversity leads to broader, fairer and more diverse organisations and communities.\n\nPascal Lambert\n\nChief Country Officer for Singapore, and\n\nHead of Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking for Southeast Asia\n\nSociete Generale Group\n\nDIVERSITY and inclusion are at the top of Societe Generale's human resources agenda and we seek to provide workplace equality between men and women at all levels. The bank has set itself a number of objectives in order to continually develop diversity, including a plan to increase the number of female executive staff.\n\nAt our headquarters in France, women make up nearly 60 per cent of our employees and over 43 per cent of managers. In Asia, the numbers are 44 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. We are very proud of the fact that we are the only company listed on the CAC40 to have a representation of women of over 20 per cent at every level of the bank, from line staff all the way to the board of directors.\n\nSociete Generale is supportive of all initiatives to increase the participation of women on boards, including the provision of training and inclusion of the issue within the Code of Corporate Governance best practices.\n\nRobert Wilkes\n\nManaging Director - Singapore\n\nTowers Watson\n\nADVANCING women to positions of leadership is a smart business decision. The presence of different points of view allows management to make informed decisions, which can only happen when you have people from different backgrounds and experience. Companies that have female directors and executives lead by example. It sends a clear message that they value diverse perspectives and experience.\n\nOn the Towers Watson board, our lead independent director, Linda Rabbitt, actively champions the advancement of women within Towers Watson. As a member of the board's nominating and governance committee, she inspires our senior executives to continue to expand and strengthen our diversity and inclusion efforts. She also helped set up ''On the Board'', an innovative programme that prepares women for public company board service. We believe board diversity is critical to fuelling innovation, leads to better decision-making and can enhance the company brand in the markets they serve.\n\nGeorge McFerran\n\nManaging Director, Apac\n\neFinancialCareers\n\nWHEN it comes to diversity, many financial services professionals in Singapore echo the concerns about gender imbalance in the boardroom. In fact a recent survey by eFinancialCareers revealed that over six in ten (62 per cent) believe women are under-represented at the board level. While the issue is widely recognised, experts remain divided on a solution. But professionals in financial services generally agree that workplace flexibility and improved gender diversity policies are the key to women climbing the corporate ladder.\n\nMany firms are already aware of the need to improve gender diversity and the vast majority have good initiatives in place. What this suggests is that to achieve real results, the responsibility for gender diversity extends further than the corporate board. Initiatives need to be promoted more effectively and implemented from entry level. Almost half (48 per cent) of financial services professionals say that gender diversity is very important to them when choosing a future employer - this means that organisations that can show a commitment to diversity will be able to attract the best talent as well as get women to the top.\n\nLeong Yee May\n\nSenior Vice-President\n\nOrange Business Services Asia Pacific\n\nDIVERSITY is integral to business. I believe that social, cultural and gender diversity is a powerful driver of the company's performance, innovation capacity, and attractiveness as an employer. Embracing diversity and providing equal opportunity helps attract and retain clients, apart from building loyalty among our employees. It has also improved our company's efficiency and performance.\n\nOrange is committed to ensuring gender parity, not just at board level, but throughout our workforce. We are doing this through gender-balanced hiring programmes and by providing equal opportunity to both genders across all levels within the organisation. In 2013, one-third of board members, and one-quarter of executive committee members at Orange, were women. We hope to raise this to 35 per cent across all management positions by 2015. While we encourage a culture based on merit, we are aware of social deterrents that can impact gender diversity at the workplace. Hence, we encourage female students to learn more about technical and leadership roles through ''shadowing programmes''. In 2012, more than 60 students shadowed Orange's female engineers and technicians in the US, India, Singapore, and elsewhere, to learn more about their day-to-day work.\n\nIn Singapore's context, ensuring diversity on corporate boards cannot take place overnight but any hindrance to equal opportunity must be removed. Businesses should encourage diversity and overcome any social barriers or traditional mindsets. They could include proactive measures to draw women with leadership potential into ''talent pools'', as well as mentoring programmes for women with managerial aspirations. In the long run, corporations should also carry out periodic assessments to ensure roles, responsibilities and remuneration are proportional and without any bias. We need to build a workplace that is based on merit and does not favour any gender, race or community.\n\nHari V Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nIT's always good to solve a problem before it becomes a problem.\n\nSolving the issue of gender diversity at the top echelons of a company requires a look at downstream factors that may disrupt the careers of female employees when they are holding junior to middle management responsibilities. For example, at these points in their careers, they may be thinking of having children. Our study shows that two of out three women in Singapore plan to put their careers on hold when they have a child, 50 per cent higher than the global average. Clearly, having a more conducive environment that encourages women to return to work after having children will be critical.\n\nFew would disagree that diversity in business is good for business. This is a view shared by many of our clients whenever we discuss talent issues. After all, an inclusive company that embraces diversity across many dimensions such as age, gender, ethnicity, skills and philosophies, will be more responsive to the needs of a wider group of stakeholders and clients.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nDIVERSITY is fundamentally about the value of the different perspectives that individuals can contribute as a result of their experiences, qualifications and other attributes that define them. Gender is but just one factor in the diversity mix. Given that the board is collectively responsible for the company's long-term strategy and success, and if we accept that diversity drives rigour in thinking and decision-making that can lead to improved corporate performance, then diversity - including that of gender - ought to be the business of boards.\n\nEnsuring diversity should not fall prey to a ''tick-the-box'' exercise. Quotas serve little value if the spirit of inclusion is absent or challenges to established thinking are dismissed quickly. As a start, instilling the discipline to develop a skills matrix, and establishing and continually reviewing directors' experience and expertise that align with the business strategy, will be key, as this will underpin the company's ability to ensure board diversity as well as communicate its board composition and renewal to shareholders with confidence.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nI AM all for gender diversity and this is evident from the number of women in our senior management team at PrimeStaff.\n\nWhile I certainly support initiatives that will help increase the regrettably low proportion of women directors on corporate boards, I don't believe that it should be mandated via legislation or quotas. Forcing companies to put women on their boards will be counter-productive and work against the women in the long run, as doing so just to hit the quota may propagate a perception that they are less deserving and thus defeat the purpose entirely.\n\nIn my view, gender diversity is not necessarily the business of corporate boards. However, it is the corporation's duty to ensure that its policies enable all qualified individuals to be given equal opportunity for consideration based on the individual's merits. Prescriptive measures aside, this issue also has to do with cultural norms where corporate boards are still largely perceived to be a ''boys' club'' in Singapore.\n\nCorporations should address the root of the issue and find ways to create a paradigm shift among their top management - to dismantle this perception and be more open to welcoming women into the C-suite and ultimately, onto their boards. Only then will the right foundation be laid for lasting cultural change to take hold.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nNOT too long ago, men dominated corporate boards with hardly any woman alongside. Over time, it has been proven that having women on corporate boards has provided a different dimension and this is valuable to businesses.\n\nDrawing from my experience in Canada where I used to live, gender diversity is clearly the responsibility of the board. They must be the initiator by creating an environment where the search for talent ''naturally'' includes female professionals from the outset. Too often, it is an afterthought introduced to ensure the appearance of gender balance. This is a disservice to the more than capable female executives. To ensure diversity in any aspect of life, the starting point needs to be a goal. As in education, or employment, quotas in Singapore are widely implemented and should also be rolled out at board level for gender diversity.\n\nAt Maachu, when we invite applications for senior positions, we are ''gender blind'' as it should be the best person for the job and not based on gender preference. This should also apply to corporate boards.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nAS businesses become more global and complex, companies need to attract talent who think differently and can adopt a variety of approaches to problem-solving.\n\nOrganisations need to attract these diverse talent - whether it is diversity in gender, age, ethnicity or other competencies, not only for the board director level but also at the staff level. A lack of diverse talent could inhibit a company's growth.\n\nTo ensure that companies select the best directors, boards should ensure that they source for potential candidates from as wide a talent pool as possible. Studies have shown that a diverse board will reduce the amount of groupthink, produce better results and promote good corporate governance, all essential attributes of an effective board.\n\nNominating committees play a key role in composing a board with different perspectives, experiences and skillsets who can work collectively for the good of the company. Its role includes ensuring it identifies the technical competencies required for the board in addition to other diverse capabilities, and that they screen for these attributes. Thus it is essential to cast their net wide and deep when looking for such candidates.\n\nNatalie Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager, EMEA & Apac\n\nKelly Services\n\nTHE responsibility to ensure gender diversity extends beyond the boardroom. In fact, the shortage of female board directors is more likely to be solved by building gender diversity in providing sufficient opportunities for women to reach leadership positions, rather than introducing quotas or laws. We should educate companies to help them understand that gender diversity impacts economic performance, growth and profitability. Having good intentions about seeing women in leadership is insufficient; identifying barriers and putting concrete actions in place to achieve the desired results is imperative.\n\nAt Kelly, taking a conscious approach has resulted in women now accounting for a third of Kelly's senior executives and 36 per cent of the board (up from 17 per cent a decade ago). We have a women business resource group - Leadership in Action (LIA), Powered by the Women in Kelly - that is open to both male and female leaders within Kelly to contribute their ideas and shape the company's business strategy. LIA also serves as an opportunity to build our internal leadership pipeline and has a significant impact on the development of leaders in the company.\n\nEmma Dale\n\nCo-Founder and Managing Director (Asia)\n\nProspect Resourcing\n\nWHEN introducing gender diversity in any setting, it's important not to view it as a women-only agenda. Gender diversity is about the proven business results to be gained from having a more gender-diverse workforce. At present board positions in Asia are dominated by men but having women at the top table would most certainly add value. A recent study, titled Singapore Board Diversity Report 2013: Time for Women to Rise, showed that organisations with women on the board saw a positive effect on performance in terms of return on assets and return on equity.\n\nRecruitment plays a crucial role in gender diversity. Educating line managers about the benefits of a gender-diverse team as well as having the right hiring processes in place can minimise gender bias from the very beginning. When it comes to succession planning, having a more equal balance of men and women will naturally produce a talent pool of future leaders that's more reflective of society.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nTHE primary criterion of selecting members for the board of companies is hardly about women's rights or even things such as racial diversity, but rather about ensuring that the best decisions are made in the boardrooms for all stakeholders. Yes, I feel that having more women would definitely be a benefit as there would be a larger spectrum of perspectives leading to a holistic approach to achieving the best results.\n\nDiversity, however, is not just based on being a man or woman; it is also about diversity in knowledge, background, training, expertise and experience. It is therefore vital to ensure that a board encompasses a good mix of professionals with such multifarious background. Across society here, meritocracy rises above many other aspects where talent engagement is concerned and the corporate setting should be no different. Therefore, as much as a company desires to assemble a team of board members with diverse views and contributions, they should first ensure that they select members in a manner that places such merits above all else.\n\nDaniel Soh\n\nManaging Partner\n\nLeadership Advisory Inc\n\nTHE decision on who should be nominated to serve on the board is now more considered, in terms of adding value and experience. For companies to be competitive, they need to plan strategically and think ''out of the box'' about their board composition. To build a more diverse board, the nominating committee must be willing to look beyond the traditional pools of talent tapped for corporate boards and present a diverse panel of potential candidates. This should include C-suite executives who are successful professionals and entrepreneurs, or even functional specialists, which the current board may not be familiar or less comfortable with.\n\nThe process should start with the perspective for a more diverse board and a clear strategy. Diversity should not be taken out of a sense of fairness. It should ensure that the ''best candidates'' are brought together to address the challenges. Corporate boards at many companies have dramatically improved their handling of CEO succession planning, with a view on both internal and external prospective candidates. Addressing their attention to gender diversity could be one of their hardest challenges.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nDIVERSITY is the business of corporate boards. A diverse workforce benefits the organisation in various ways, including a range of talents and expertise. A diverse organisation also encourages an open and inclusive corporate culture that's helpful not only for growing the bottom line but also in promoting employer branding and talent retention.\n\nThe way we look at diversity determines the way we view talent. Diversity is a necessity in the modern workplace and it has to be embedded in the way we recruit, train, promote and also the way we do business. Ensuring gender diversity must be a concerted effort. Whether it is externally hiring a female top talent or recruiting and promoting organically, companies must invest in building roadmaps for high potentials, specifically designed to attract women, including mentoring and coaching programmes.\n\nBrad Adams\n\nHead of HR Research & Product Management in Asia\n\nCEB\n\nOUR view is that the notion of diverse board leaders as ''Diversity Heroes'' is simply insufficient. While diversity at the board level is important, for companies to truly capitalise on diversity, an inclusive mindset is required across the entire workforce.\n\nOur data shows that diverse and inclusive companies get better results; they have employees who work 12 per cent harder, are 19 per cent more likely to stay, and collaborate up to 57 per cent more effectively. In addition, our research shows that while 80 per cent of executives support diversity and inclusion initiatives, less than half of Singapore workers think their organisation is diverse or inclusive. To improve workforce diversity and inclusion, organisations must firstly make broad diversity goals and inclusive behaviour real for managers and employees in the context of their daily work and, secondly, assess and reward for progress, not goal achievement.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nAS the agents of shareholders, the board of directors forms one of the pillars of a robust corporate governance framework. Diversifying the board, including greater gender diversity, is one of the ways to strengthen corporate governance. ACCA research also found that gender diversity encourages innovation, creativity and productive collaboration. While recent trends in board appointments indicate a positive shift towards more female directorships, more can still be done in support for greater diversity. Corporate boards should therefore ensure that gender diversity is high on the agenda.\n\nCorporations should take a multi-pronged approach to ensure that their boards are broadly diverse. Companies are encouraged to establish a formal search and nomination process for board appointments as suggested by the Diversity Task Force as this would allow them to achieve the appropriate diversity of competencies and gender.\n\nWhere there are imbalances on the board, whether male or female, suitable candidates could be identified from available databases and listings objectively and training be required to be given to these candidates to ensure that they function effectively in the board. Lastly, a change in mindset may be necessary in order to welcome and accept a more heterogeneous board. This would require a concerted effort by the board to change corporate culture, if necessary.\n\nPhilippe HJ Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South East Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nLAST year, McKinsey reported that nearly half of Fortune 1,000 companies have just one or no woman in C-suite positions. Despite this statistic, the gender imbalance has improved greatly from previous years when there were hardly any women on corporate boards. Studies have also showed the positive link between companies that have embraced gender diversity and improved financial performance.\n\nStill, the principle of having more women in the boardroom should not be inculcated through quotas or incentives. Such mandatory adoption, as seen in some countries in Europe, could prove counter-productive in the search for top talent. Instead, companies need to recognise the benefits of gender-diverse teams and develop a hiring strategy that encourages diversity while still ensuring board appointments are based on merit.\n\nMixed-gender boards typically perform better in terms of problem-solving through the presentation of a wider variety of viewpoints, ideas and market insights which in turn offer superior information-based decision-making. In this respect, women board members are no different from their male counterparts in being able to contribute critical skillsets such as management experience and functional expertise.\n\nInternational SOS was recently presented with the TAFEP Exemplary Employer Award 2014 for Outstanding Inclusive Workplace Culture. We have a strong representation of women throughout our ranks including in senior positions such as country general managers and on executive committees. Any staff member who epitomises our core values (Passion, Expertise, Care and Respect) and displays consistent excellent performance, is given an opportunity for career advancement including into senior leadership roles.\n\nPaul Endacott\n\nManaging Director, SEA\n\nAmbition Group Ltd\n\nGENDER diversity is and should be the business of corporate boards, just as it is the responsibility of the senior management in an organisation. For an organisation to promote gender diversity, it needs to lead by example and this is reflected in having a diverse board.\n\nThe benefits that gender diversity brings to the organisation need to be recognised and emphasised by the company through its recruitment and promotion strategy, and there needs to be a commitment to achieving this diversity across the organisation too. With the right balance between quota and meritocracy, gender diversity is definitely something that is achievable by all boards.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\nTHE benefits of board diversity to good corporate governance have been well-documented. Having board members with diverse backgrounds and experience promotes fresh perspectives, healthy debate and board independence. There is thus merit to promoting gender diversity on corporate boards. However it should be one out of many factors when considering board composition and should not be pursued for its own sake.\n\nTo promote board diversity in general, companies can consider setting a diversity policy for their board. They can also conduct self-assessment to identity the gaps in skills and experience in their current board, and use that as a basis for recruiting new members to the board. Creating a culture that embraces diversity and is open to new board members is equally important.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nCountry Director\n\nRandstad Singapore\n\nTHE Randstad World of Work 2013/14 report revealed that although 62 per cent of employers surveyed say more women in leadership roles will be a critical success factor for their organisations, only 15 per cent of them look to recruit more women. This is alarming as organisations that do not encourage gender diversity would not only narrow the pool of available talent, but also miss out the unique perspectives and business acumen that female employees can bring.\n\nTo ensure gender diversity, it is key for business leaders to make diversity a priority and take measurable actions from the top, including the CEO and the board, and throughout the organisation. Organisations need to build an organisational structure and value proposition that supports diversity, for example, adopt flexible working options to help employees to achieve worklife balance and provide mentors to fast-track women into leadership roles.\n\nJulienne Loh\n\nGeneral Manager, Singapore\n\nMasterCard Worldwide\n\nIT's admirable that the Diversity Action Committee is working with various stakeholders to create a conducive environment that helps encourage support for women on boards. As a global business with a good gender mix on our board and in executive management, we regard diversity as the root of innovation. We believe that diversity of culture, experience and thought all drives innovative thinking.\n\nMasterCard surveys have found that Singaporeans consistently believe more support - from employers, better representation in government, better access to home help and better maternity and paternity leave - is key to enabling and empowering women to excel and advance in their chosen roles. However, the ultimate goal should be appointing the right people for the right positions, so that companies reap the most benefits.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman / Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nRUNNING a board has less to do with gender than ability. Board members can come from diverse backgrounds - they can be part of the companies' management teams or they can be major shareholders or professionals. No matter their backgrounds, they have to possess the capability to be elected to the board.\n\nThat said, having women on the board would be beneficial. They can offer different perspectives as well as maintain harmony among the members. However, corporations should not deliberately choose board members using gender (or gender ratio) as a requirement.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nI SUPPORT the Diversity Task Force's recommendation to adopt a soft approach to try to redress the sharp gender imbalance. Rather than recommending legislation or mandatory quotas on female directorship, the preference to use persuasive power to get companies to put more women on their boards is wise. The bottom line is to ensure that the board comprises people who can get the company going up to higher levels and that they can provide good leadership in the implementation of the company's policies. Nothing to do with gender! There should be a spirit of meritocracy.\n\nI also agree that boards must be diverse in all aspect, not just in gender. Women who are appointed to boards must be of a certain calibre and capability comparable to their male counterparts. They should be able to contribute on their own merits. They should not be appointed as directors solely because of their gender or to meet a quota requirement. Ultimately from a business point of view, the members of the board, whether male or female, must be able to bring value to the entire business.\n\nChris Hill\n\nCEO - SE Asia\n\nBlack Sun Pte Ltd\n\nTHE statistics will ultimately be driven by education demographics, immigration trends and social mobility, making board diversity unavoidable. However, the view expressed by SIAS is not reflected internationally, particularly in the EU and UK where both public sentiment and regulation have played an active role in board diversity trends. Black Sun conducts annual research into corporate reporting trends of the FTSE 100 companies, now in its eighth year of publication. In our most recent analysis of annual reports in 2013, it was evident that companies were showing an improvement in gender balance. This has been driven by a combination of persuasion and regulation.\n\nIn 2011 the Lord Davies Review on gender diversity was released, which recommended - not required - that boards should aim for 25 per cent female representation by 2015. This, coupled with the new regulatory requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013) to report the number of males and females on the board, senior management and the organisation as a whole, appears to be driving progress.\n\nBlack Sun data shows that 93 per cent of FTSE 100 boards have female representation, up from 78 per cent three years before. Progress has also been made in both executive and non-executive areas, with 19 per cent of companies having female executives, up from 17 per cent in the prior year, and the number of female non-executives increasing to 89 per cent, up from 72 per cent three years earlier. In addition, FTSE 100 companies continue to disclose their board diversity policies, with 63 per cent doing this up from 56 per cent in the prior year. This increased focus on reporting board diversity policies, having to report the gender mix and the recommendations from the Lord Davies Review has helped to focus the minds of companies and ultimately led them to focus on the female talent pipeline. Therefore it seems entirely plausible that female representation will keep increasing. Of note, 31 per cent of companies already reached the target set in the Lord Davies Review, up from 13 per cent in the prior year.\n\nFrom our experience in Europe, the focus on board diversity in government debates, the media, institutional investor discussions and regulatory reforms has led corporates to react and make gender diversity the business of boards and ensure that they not only factor this into their succession planning, but report back to explain their approach to ensuring diversity of the business and how this will benefit strategic decision-making going forward.\n\nJessica Tan\n\nManaging Director\n\nMicrosoft Singapore\n\nI AGREE that gender diversity is the business of corporate boards. But I do believe this is more than just a question of having more women in leadership positions. In today's fast-paced and competitive landscape, the importance of having a diverse pool of talents - regardless of gender, creed, race or age - and an inclusive workplace cannot be over-emphasised because it could potentially impact the company's talent base and long-term future.\n\nBy embracing the diversity of their talents, companies can benefit from the breadth of perspectives, skills and experiences that would enable them to be more innovative in the products and services they develop, and successfully serve the needs of an increasingly global and diverse customer and partner base. Similarly, having an inclusive environment where all talents are given equal opportunities to succeed will ensure that companies can attract, develop and retain their best talents, for the success of their businesses.\n\nDaniel Rudolph\n\nPresident\n\nHenkel Singapore\n\nAT Henkel, gender is an important pillar of our diversity strategy. For our consumer products especially, women are key direct or indirect users. In order to meet their needs, it is important for us to reflect this audience within Henkel's employee structure.\n\nWomen have also become a key talent resource. In Henkel, the share of women in management positions rose from 26 per cent in 2008 to around 32 per cent at the end of 2013. Henkel has a chairwoman on the supervisory board and a woman on the management board. We invest in developing our talented female employees and helping them realise their leadership potential. While the call for women in leadership positions is loud and sustained, Henkel is against a fixed female quota. Irrespective of gender, everyone is assessed and promoted based on their performance and potential.\n\nMark Billington\n\nRegional Director, South East Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nDESPITE being a progressive and high-income economy with women making up half of its labour force, gender diversity remains a challenge in Singapore's boardrooms. Women continue to be under-represented and it is the role of the government as well as corporate boards to actively encourage greater female participation in leadership roles.\n\nIn this aspect, Singapore could look towards Malaysia which promotes women in leadership positions as contributing towards progress for organisations and the nation. It has set a national agenda of increasing female participation in decision-making positions to 30 per cent by 2016. ICAEW is supporting this effort with a recently launched Women in Leadership programme that provides leadership development for Malaysian women aiming to take up leadership positions. This is something that could be emulated in Singapore, along with an introduction of effective work-life balance policies that could support women in juggling work and family responsibilities - a key obstacle women often struggle with in career advancement.\n\nMore female representation is one aspect of diversity but what is also important is to ensure diversity in thinking as well as in personnel. Boards need to be diverse not just in appearance but also in substance; they need to be open to all views and perspectives.\n\nRoland Smith\n\nVice-President and Managing Director, Apac\n\nCentre for Creative Leadership\n\nYES, the lack of gender diversity is absolutely a matter that should be addressed by corporate boards. This is especially alarming since men and women in Singapore both have equal educational opportunities and equally high literacy rates (98 per cent for men and 94 per cent for women, according to official data).\n\nCorporations should provide equal opportunities for capable women to be groomed as leaders. In fact, research has shown that the feminine style of leadership (being more empathetic, humane and relationship-oriented) is more effective in modern organisations.\n\nCorporations can promote an environment that provides equal access to special assignments and training programmes, keeping track on women talent, and providing flexibility to women with family responsibilities. They can also encourage the formation of formal or informal associations, where female colleagues provide mutual support for each other. Women tend to be more relationship-oriented and are often team players, and hence networks like these are a great resource of support.\n\nZaheer Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQI Group of Companies\n\nTHE McKinsey study, Moving mind-sets on gender diversity, found that female executives were equally capable and ambitious, but that their confidence to reach the top echelons depended more on a strong and supportive corporate culture, and support from the top management in particular. Clearly, as such, meritocratic values and inculcated inclusiveness in a seemingly male-dominated space are key to ensuring board diversity. This is not an alien concept and is achievable by creating awareness and emphasising the eventual benefits that diversity brings.\n\nThese benefits are broadly evident in things such as enhanced client insights, strong performance on both financial and non-financial indicators and, in part, improved board effectiveness as evident from studies such as The Business Case for Women on Boards. That said, I subscribe to the belief that the politics of diversity has no place being the ''business'' of the board. It helps, but it cannot be an overarching factor that a board makes it a significant concern over actual business matters. This would be disingenuous to stakeholders (as much as to either gender) as it would seem that any appointment finds possible ulterior motives over reality - which is the election of the best person in the correct chair. In my view, by creating awareness, boards will serve and ensure in time that the adage ''the best (wo)man for the job'' becomes truly gender-neutral.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nBOARD diversity is not just about gender diversity; that woud be too restrictive and narrow a perspective. It is really not the business of the board to be gender-sensitive to the point where the nominating committee must consider gender diversity as part of the equation for balance. The business of the board is to ensure that it has all the competency and capabilities to discharge its duties properly.\n\nThe board must select its members first on character, competencies and capabilities in a specific domain. The lack of women on boards is probably due more to the relatively fewer number of women in senior positions to form a sizeable pool to select from. This can be addressed by training women for directorship and having a register to show area of expertise, industry and availability for board nominations. It is more a supply-demand dissonance than any deliberate effort to keep the board to an all-male bastion.\n\nThe board must constantly be seeking diversity in its structure so that groupthink can be reduced and quality of representation can be enhanced. Diversity must not be looked at through the lens of discrimination and biases, but from a point where diversity will add strengths to decision-making since the views come from various angles.\n\nWomen's representation on board is still sorely lacking and it must be generally agreed that they bring about a different blend of thought leadership, command and control. As evidenced from the corporate and political arenas where women hold sway, matriarchal leadership is equally powerful. Question is where can we find enough of these leaders? Like the song by Peter, Paul and Mary, where have all the flowers gone, long time passing?\n\nI hope an open register of trained and certified directors at the Singapore Institute of Directors or Singapore Exchange will help open doors for diversity. Not just gender but all aspects of diversity.\n\nPatrick Liew\n\nManaging Partner\n\nGlobal Enterprise Exchange\n\nTHERE is compelling evidence to suggest that gender diversity can enhance a corporate board's monitoring function and improve the company's financial value and performance. However, to have a positive effect, it depends on the strategic intent of the company, corporate culture, and the way key stakeholders relate and interact with one another.\n\nFor example, research by Renee B Adams and Daniel Ferreira showed that having a more diverse board should not place added stress on existing infrastructure. It should not also incur additional expenses to induce cooperation, including having additional board meetings and performance-based pay.\n\nTherefore, before implementing a gender diversity policy, the company has to educate its stakeholders about preference- or perception-based discrimination. There may be a need to change negative cultural norms and gender stereotypes.\n\nIn some cases, the old-boy network may have to accommodate and adapt to a different style of operation. It has to be open-minded and learn that there may be a better way to serve on a corporate board.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The move is also at odds with the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund's mandate to drive key projects in its home base and woo foreign investments into Malaysia.\n\n\"Why is a state-owned fund hiring a small firm run by a very smallish team to manage its funds which it may not have complete control over?\" asked a market watcher.\n\nBased on its website, Bridge Partners, which specialises in offshore private funds, is led by managing director Mr Lobo Lee Kwok Ning, who has 20 years' experience in equity investments and derivatives. He was previously senior vice-president of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.\n\nThe firm's asset management team has two other directors.\n\nDocuments also reveal that a Swiss private bank in Singapore produced portfolio statements on these funds, possibly to indicate that the funds are genuine. It is unclear why the bank felt the need to do that, as such reports are typically issued by the fund manager - in this case, Bridge Partners.\n\nBridge Capital and Brazen Sky first came into the picture two years ago following a convoluted and perplexing tie-up between 1MDB, then helmed by chief executive officer Shahrol Halmi, and obscure firm PetroSaudi International (PSI), headed by Tarek Essam Ahmad Obaid, a Saudi royalty.\n\n1MDB's tie-up with PSI - 1MDB PetroSaudi - is the fund's first joint venture since it was set up in 2009, not too long after it raised RM5 billion ($1.9 billion) through a bond issue.\n\nThe Malaysian-backed fund ploughed US$1 billion cash for its 40 per cent into the US$2.5 billion joint venture firm domiciled in BVI. PSI forked out no cash, only oil and gas assets for its 60 per cent share, which according to documents was valued at US$2.7 billion.\n\nSources said that, in the early stages of the deal, some 1MDB board members were concerned about the value and quality of the assets being injected and had preferred instead for PSI to fork out at least 50 per cent cash for its portion to match 1MDB's cash outlay.\n\nThe pact flopped and, following a series of complex manoeuvrings, issuance of Islamic debt facility and asset flippings, 1MDB's wholly-owned 1MDB International Holdings ended up with a 49 per cent stake of PSI's PetroSaudi Oil Services Ltd (PSOSL). The stake was valued at US$2.2 billion.\n\n1MDB then sold all of 1MDB International Holdings, whose sole asset was the PSOSL stake, to Bridge Partners for US$2.3 billion, turning in a profit of some US$95 million.\n\nTo satisfy the purchase, Bridge Partners issued six interest-free promissory notes with a one-month expiry data. 1MDB then invested the proceeds by subscribing for all the shares in Brazen Sky, which in turn reinvested the sum into the SPC.\n\nDocuments also reveal that Mr Shahrol, 1MDB's then-boss - who left in March last year to join another government unit - had the sole discretion to decide where the funds would be reinvested.\n\n1MDB has been in the line of fire after its latest financial accounts showed that it carried liabilities of some RM40 billion. It also would have been in the red by as much as RM1.8 billion, if not for a RM2.7 billion revaluation gain on land it got from the government.\n\nThe fund, chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been dogged by controversy since its inception five years ago and has had to frequently allay fears that the billions of dollars in its coffers - mostly raised through borrowings and ploughed into controversial investments - are safe.\n\nMore recently, following calls by the Malaysian media for 1MDB to bring the funds totalling some RM18 billion back to Malaysia, the fund responded by saying that \"substantial portions\" of the overseas funds have been brought back and used for energy and property projects and earmarked for future investments.\n\nBT's attempts to contact 1MDB and Bridge Partners for comments were unsuccessful.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Take-up rates tend to begin slowly, and then accelerate as companies, and the industry, develop a deeper understanding of the area.\"\n\nData breach\n\nThis was the case in the United States and the United Kingdom, where cyber liability insurance is becoming a common class of business insurance, Ms Teo added. Insurance can cover the whole gamut of risks, from negligence claims, to a loss of revenue from business interruption.\n\nA massive data breach at US retailer Target in December highlighted the damage that can ensue from such an incident. After credit-card details of over 100 million people were stolen, Target said sales were significantly weaker after the breach, as consumers shied away for fear of a repeat incident.\n\nA similar data breach also took place in South Korea.\n\nAs for Singapore, Ms Teo said, the gradual take-up of cyber liability insurance could suggest a surge in demand later, as data protection issues here bear greater prominence in the coming months.\n\nThis awareness, combined with the full Personal Data Protection Act, or PDPA, coming into effect in July, should prompt companies to examine their risk management and insurance programmes more closely.\n\n\"It's encouraging to see the 'it won't happen to me' mindset changing, as companies recognise the new reality of cyber risk in Singapore and across Asia,\" said Ms Teo.\n\nGreater awareness has also lifted demand for liabilities insurance for directors, she pointed out. As directors become more concerned about the risks of poor corporate governance, they have been more vigilant in checking that companies have them covered.\n\n\"Before, if they were invited to the board, they would just feel very honoured,\" said Ms Teo.\n\n\"Now, they ask: 'How much is your director's liability policy?'\"\n\nShe noted that the more developed a market is, the more litigious it tends to be.\n\nMs Teo also pointed out other changes in company policies here as Singapore society evolves. Marsh Singapore, which sells insurance directly to companies as well as offers consultation services, has seen companies providing a more flexible suite of benefits.\n\nBusinesses here are now looking into healthcare coverage for their employees, particularly as they juggle the costs from higher employee benefits against the need to attract talent.\n\nThis means that, instead of providing healthcare coverage alone, companies can provide gym subscriptions or even subsidies for eye care, noted Ms Teo.\n\n\"We are encouraging clients to look at wellness programmes,\" she added.\n\nleejamie@sph.com.sg\n\n@JamieLeeBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That could help facilities that sought the provision, such as Port Everglades in South Florida, reduce construction time by years.\n\n\"That's a big part of this bill,\" House Transportation Committee chairman Bill Shuster, said in an interview. \"They've got money ready to go.\"\n\nThe Water Resources Reform and Development Act is seen as one of the few examples of bipartisan action in a polarised Congress that's on pace to become the least productive in history in terms of bills passed.\n\nThe full legislation probably won't be released until later this week, Mr Shuster and his Senate Democratic counterpart, Barbara Boxer of California, said in a joint statement.\n\nThe Senate-passed version would have authorised money to take action in response to rising sea levels or increased ocean temperatures resulting from global warming.\n\nHouse Republicans who have resisted new spending linked to climate change rejected that provision.\n\nEven so, Senate majority leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said the agreement contains language about the effect of global warming on sea levels and ocean temperatures.\n\nThe final sticking point in the talks was over a proposed National Endowment for Oceans that Mr Shuster said was dropped.\n\nThe largest navigation project included in both the House and Senate-passed measures would deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, which connects the oil-refining hub of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, with the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Port Arthur area is home to the southern end of the Keystone XL pipeline. Deepening the port will reduce shipping costs for oil and natural gas processed there by Exxon Mobil, Total and Cheniere Energy.\n\nThat deepening project was included in the final bill, Mr Shuster said, along with more than two dozen others. For Port Evergalades the measure could bring as much as US$181 million.\n\nAlso authorised, Mr Shuster said, are storm and flood prevention projects, including the Morganza to the Gulf levee system sought by lawmakers in storm-battered Louisiana and a diversion channel for the Red River of the North that would reduce flood risks in Fargo, the largest city in North Dakota.\n\nThe final language will be released this week, negotiators said in a joint statement. The House could take up the bill as early as the week of May 19. - WP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

VICTORIA HO reports\n\nPublished\n\nSun, May 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMOST companies in the Asia-Pacific are poorly prepared for cybersecurity breaches, and as more threats become focused - targeted attacks on individual firms - an intrusion would likely catch most victims flat-footed, according to cybercrime watchers at EY (formerly Ernst & Young). Massimo Cotrozzi, assistant director of fraud investigation and dispute services for EY in the UK and Ireland, said that in his work with companies, he has discovered that the level of cybersecurity preparedness has not been up to snuff.\n\nThe past eight years or so has seen companies building protection plans covering hypothetical threats. But companies that are leading in security are talking about the impact on their businesses due to threats over the past few years, rather than discuss risk.\n\n\"In general, companies that have found that they were compromised at some point, didn't realise they were at the time,\" he said, adding that this knowledge gap is due to the lack of skilled security specialists that companies can hire.\n\nLawrance Lai, partner with EY's fraud investigation department in Singapore, said that local companies are displaying a \"marked change in sentiment\" when it comes to cybersecurity - they are far less blas\u00e9 about it, and are no longer simply guarding against potential attacks. \"They are channelling their energies towards developing a proactive stance, because they realise that threats are becoming increasingly complex, and require advanced (tools).\"\n\nIt's no wonder that the Singapore government has elevated cyber-security to a top-level concern, he noted.\n\nThe government has set up a five-year cyber-security master plan that focuses on buffing up IT infrastructure, and investing in growing the pool of personnel with specialised skills. \"Cybercrime is a key priority on the national agenda. As a global financial hub, Singapore is not spared from the increasing threat of attack.\"\n\nMr Cotrozzi pointed out that security staff need to be competent in IT forensics, but they also need to be keenly tapped into business processes so that they know how to catch intrusions, or know how intrusions would take down a business.\n\n\"Every security system is different. You need to understand the logic of the (overall) system,\" he said.\n\nHe added that companies keen to crank their preparedness up a notch should start by rewriting the processes in place to deal with intrusions, he said.\n\nConsider the tools needed and what the company already uses, in an overhead view of the organisation, he advised. Often, companies rely on a panoply of tools that have been cobbled together over the years, but do not form a cohesive defence when put together.\n\n\"One of our clients had anti-virus software for incoming mail, and border security as an outer ring defence,\" he said. But the IT department didn't make the logical link between the two, and didn't realise that the anti-virus having to catch malware meant that the border security outside it had failed.\n\n\"The security processes were not in place to flag these incidents,\" he said.\n\nIt's tough for companies because security tools available in the market aren't as intelligent as companies would need for advanced threats, he said. \"Analytics (and big data) software companies are just starting to integrate security into their intelligence products.\"\n\nFurthermore, security software that is too enthusiastic in blocking threats become hindrances to workers, who find they have to jump through too many hoops to get something done, Mr Cotrozzi added.\n\nThis results in workers removing or bypassing the security products in an effort to be productive. \"Companies don't want to risk losing business because of security,\" he said, on companies removing their security software or keeping vigilance levels low.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be aimed at a mix of leisure and corporate travellers who want a bit more comfort than in economy class.\n\n\"There is a niche there that is quite established in the market now. We are now designing the product to fit that segment and we will come up with something that will be interesting,\" Mr Mak said.\n\nThis additional space is going to come out of economy class. \"We will have to take out some economy class (seats), but at the end of the day, premium economy is a product that we think can command a better premium than the equivalent economy.\"\n\nUOB Kay Hian analyst K Ajith said the move carries the risk of cannibalising SIA's business class product, but also noted that the airline has little choice, given stiff competition and how other airlines already have similar offerings. \"But they could, of course, price it in such a way that there is still a differential. Typically, business class seats before promotions can generally be 3-5 times that of economy. SIA could price the premium economy seats 100-150 per cent higher than economy class on routes where there's less competition,\" he said.\n\nAbout a decade ago, SIA had a similar class option in place, billed as \"executive economy\", on its non-stop flights to the United States. These seats were phased out in 2008 for an all-business-class configuration.\n\nOn Thursday, SIA reported a Q4 operating loss that widened year-on-year to $60.3 million. Had it not been for large tax credits and exceptional gains, its quarterly bottom line would have been red, too. Even so, the group is doubling down. It said yesterday it will spend US$325 million to retrofit the cabins of 19 Boeing 777-300ERs, starting in early 2015 and completed by September 2016.\n\nLast July, a unit was set up within the group to examine ways to grow revenue through other channels apart from ticket sales. This \"new revenue unit\" already has several ongoing initiatives, such as the involvement of commission-based third-party products and advertising.\n\n\"We have undisclosed but ambitious targets for this unit to meet,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is changing the way they do business. In Singapore, 66 per cent of companies surveyed for a global cloud study last year indicated that one of the key benefits of the cloud is lower TCO (total cost of ownership).\n\nIn view of this, enterprise software vendor Oracle is offering a slew of cloud products to suit customer needs. Speaking to BizIT, Sanjay Sinha, vice president for product development at Oracle, noted that in order to address customer needs, Oracle launched the Oracle cloud marketplace at Oracle OpenWorld last year.\n\n\"The explosive growth of cloud, mobile, and social technologies is driving the need for organisations to gain faster and easier access to innovative and trusted business applications. Oracle cloud marketplace offers a one-stop shop of solutions for customers looking for a way to extend their suite of applications.\n\n\"It features hundreds of business applications developed by Oracle partners, enabling Oracle cloud customers to easily browse, evaluate, and license trusted business applications,\" Mr Sinha, who is based in the US, said.\n\nHe added that giving customers the power to choose business applications to suit their needs remains the key element for enterprise software purchasing. \"Customers have a choice in purchasing and deploying applications - using established business practices for on-premise applications in conjunction with using the Oracle marketplace for cloud deployment.\"\n\nMr Sinha added that cloud computing is driving a significant part of Oracle's product development plans and is a key part of its strategy. \"Oracle's long history of technology innovation, along with over seven years of relentless engineering and key strategic acquisitions, has enabled Oracle to now feature the most comprehensive cloud offerings in the world. With our focus on simplifying IT for our customers, we have seen tremendous traction for our cloud solutions across sectors, while building a complete cloud ecosystem.\"\n\nHe noted that across the Asia-Pacific, there are numerous examples of \"innovative companies exploiting Oracle cloud, including recent examples of Oracle sales cloud at CityWalk and Globetech\".\n\nIn a global adoption survey conducted last year, it was found that the majority of businesses worldwide have yet to fully integrate their cloud applications across all business functions, Mr Sinha said.\n\nHe added that, in Asia, the survey revealed that cloud adoption in Singapore businesses is at 94 per cent, one of the highest in the world when compared to the global average of 71 per cent. However, seven out of 10 of these companies have indicated that the lack of software interoperability and integration between cloud apps and existing company software remain key challenges in cloud deployment.\n\nApart from these, the lack of skilled labour is also another challenge in successful cloud deployment, he added. According to the survey, 61 per cent of companies in Singapore revealed that their employees do not have the necessary skills to maximise the cloud apps that have been deployed.\n\nHe noted that the cloud offers customers a broader choice to consume technology in order to achieve the best RoI (return on investment), leverage capacity on demand, and related innovations.\n\n\"It allows customers to fully embrace mobile technologies to maximise productivity, anytime and anywhere. In fact, we have just announced how the Oracle Cloud Marketplace is helping boost sales force adoption with the easy-to-use and intuitive user interface,\" he said.\n\nApart from these, cloud is also changing and enhancing business models for Oracle's partner ecosystem, Mr Sinha added. \"This means expanding the reach for distribution and providing further flexible choices for business models with Oracle's 400,000 customers; 25,000 Oracle partners; and 15 million community developers to create an ecosystem for shared innovating with cloud.\"\n\nHe added that Oracle enables customers to leverage their existing on-premise IT investment and have it seamlessly integrate and interoperate with their cloud and mobile deployments.\n\nMeeting this challenge highlights Oracle's R&D (research and development) investments in open standards to engineer the layers of the cloud stack to work together and interoperate with on-premise investment.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When it does so, of course, Singapore banks will be in the queue. And we hope they will be considered seriously because they have good propositions to offer Myanmar.\"\n\nInvestments from Singapore are already pouring into the country - and the two leaders hope to see cooperation between Singapore and Myanmar expand into new areas, spurring more two-way trade and investments.\n\nMr Lee noted that Myanmar and Singapore have inked a memorandum to set up a vocational training institute in Myanmar to help build a pool of skilled workers for the economic zone it is building. \"They need skilled workers - huge numbers,\" he said.\n\nA brief statement issued by Mr Lee's press secretary Chang Li Lin added that the two leaders also discussed cooperation in the legal sector.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Terms were supposed to have been reached in April, but the exclusivity period has since been extended to May 31.\n\nThe exchange urged investors to trade the counter \"with caution\".\n\nIn a note to clients, DMG & Partners described yesterday's price drop as \"unwarranted\" panic selling.\n\nEven if the China Everbright deal does not go through, each HanKore share is worth at least 9.7 cents, or a multiple of at least 15 times estimated 2015 earnings, DMG analyst Sarah Wong wrote. The company's organic business is also growing at a healthy pace, the analyst added.\n\n\"HanKore has been unfairly penalised from the negative newsflow on China Everbright,\" Ms Wong wrote.\n\nJP Morgan, in a note, recommended buying China Everbright International on dips, saying that fundamentals for the company remain intact.\n\nChina Everbright shares closed at HK$8.89 (S$1.43) in Hong Kong, down by 2.3 per cent or 21 HK cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is why we have embarked on a global expansion plan,\" Mr Wong added.\n\nEarlier this year, Procurri proposed to buy Malaysia's multi-vendor hardware maintenance firmVerity for $3.5 million, as well as a 51 per cent stake in UK-based Tinglobal Holdings for \u00a36.1 million (S$12.9 million).\n\nIn April 2013, it acquired a 50.1 per cent stake in US-based Procurri LLC for US$1 million, and subsequently increased it to a 100 per cent stake via a share swap in January 2014.\n\nDeClout's shares ended 4.9 per cent higher at $0.215 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished Fri, May 9, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMISALIGNMENT and increased weight are a big part of the issue with osteoarthritis of the knees, one of the most common causes of knee pain, say specialists. There is a higher prevalence of bow-leggedness among Asians, compared to Caucasians, and there's also quite a high prevalence of knee arthritis in Asia, says Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, medical advisor to Singapore's Inliven Center for Osteoarthritis Solutions.\n\nBut a new knee brace now available in Singapore could help, and delay the need for knee replacement surgery. Correcting small misalignment will do much to alleviate pain as well as reduce the pressure on the affected joint compartment, adds Christopher Goh, resident doctor at the centre who focuses on non-surgical management and treatment of knee osteoarthritis through rehabilitation, pain management, biomechanics and physical therapy.\n\n\"The main crux of arthritic problems is that mild misalignment gets worse if it is not corrected, and the pressure will gradually increase on the affected cartilage compartment of the knees,\" says Dr Goh, who adds that Asian society does a lot of squatting, which can exacerbate misalignment of knees.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He said Qantas expects to cut gross debt to less than four times of adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) by fiscal 2017.\n\nQantas said in February that it would cut 15 per cent of its workforce, reduce spending and sell less fuel-efficient, older planes after posting what was only its second half-yearly loss since privatisation two decades ago.\n\nMr Joyce said the airline remains committed to the cost-cutting plan, designed to save A$2 billion in the next three years.\n\nHe said the company had already seen benefits from measures such as closing an aircraft maintenance base in Avalon, Victoria state, in March, and cutting its Perth-Singapore route, freeing up newer, more efficient aircraft for busier routes.\n\nAsked if Qantas would sell its lucrative frequent flyer programme, Mr Joyce said: \"We're still working through that.\"\n\nHe said the airline wouldn't sell assets if deals did not improve the company's financial position.\n\nQantas is looking to cut costs and increase cash amid heightened competition with Virgin Australia Holdings domestically that's forced the carriers to cut ticket prices to fill seats.\n\nSeat-capacity growth is slowing to about 3.5 per cent in the six months to June on domestic routes and is heading down to 4-5 internationally, Mr Joyce said, raising the prospects that prices will become more sustainable.\n\nQantas shares have plunged more than 30 per cent over the past year, against a 5.2 per cent rise for the index. - Reuters, Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The trust expects full-year contribution from Fortune Kingswood and completed renovations at Ma On Shan Plaza and Fortune City One Market to contribute to revenue growth.\n\nThe Reit's units closed at HK$6.22 yesterday, lower by 0.3 per cent or two HK cents before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That result was China's first monthly deficit in 11 months.\n\n\"China's trade data show signs of recovery but continue to understate the true health of the export sector,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a reaction to the April figures.\n\n\"April's low export growth was, as in previous months, largely caused by rampant over-invoicing of trade to avoid capital flows last year, which has created an artificially strong base for comparison,\" he added.\n\nSlowing property activity suppressing commodity imports meant the outlook for import growth was \"relatively weak\", he said. \"China is likely to continue to post large trade surpluses this year.\"\n\nEconomist Zhang Zhiwei and colleagues at Nomura International maintained their view that growth is set to decrease further to 7.1 per cent in the current quarter. \"The April trade data hold few surprises and we maintain our view of GDP growth slowing . . . as the property sector begins to correct,\" they wrote.\n\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Lu Ting and colleagues called the year-on-year export growth \"encouraging\" and said it backed up their view that growth would accelerate slightly to 7.5 per cent.\n\nGrowth in exports to the United States and the European Union in April far outpaced their performance in March, they added. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

By Samuel Ee\n\nPublished Fri, May 9, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT is the first compact Range Rover and now, the Range Rover Evoque is also the first to have a nine-speed gearbox. This ground-breaking luxury crossover continues to look as fresh and stylish as when it debuted three years ago.\n\nFor its 2014 update, the Evoque has been given the tiniest exterior tweaks but more significant changes under the sheet metal. On the outside, only the door mirrors and front grille have been changed. But on the inside, the old six-speed automatic transmission has been upgraded to a nine-speeder, making it the first model in Singapore with this number of gear ratios.\n\nWith 50 per cent more ratios, the new nine-speed auto from ZF is still more compact than the old gearbox. Mated to the familiar two-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine, it helps to increase fuel efficiency and lower exhaust emissions. Specifically, Range Rover says that fuel economy has improved 10.3 per cent to 7.8 litres per 100 km, while carbon dioxide emissions are down 9 per cent to 181 g/km.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's exactly what the residents of small town Arcadia have to deal with when their presumed dead loved ones start reappearing in Resurrection, a new American series named as the season's most-watched regular time slot drama, overtaking The Walking Dead and The Blacklist.\n\n\"I'm really excited to see how people outside America react to it,\" says Omar Epps, who was in Singapore with co-star Kurtwood Smith (of Robocop and Star Trek fame) for a regional press tour to promote Resurrection, which premieres May 12.\n\nHenry (Kurtwood Smith) and Lucille Langston (Frances Fisher), an elderly couple, are at the centre of this plot, when their son Jacob Langston, who died over 30 years ago, is the first of the not-so-dead to turn up. Also involved in the mystery is immigration agent J Martin Bellamy (Omar Epps), with a past of his own, who defies orders and takes Jacob back to his family.\n\nIn this television adaption of the book The Returned, the residents of Arcadia find themselves conflicted when their loved ones return and try to reintegrate themselves back into society, as living, breathing people who have not aged since death.\n\n\"I think it's overall just a universal story, even though it's fiction, everyone will be able to relate to it,\" says Epps, who previously starred in medical drama House. \"Being human beings, dealing with life and death, it's what connects us.\"\n\n\"It's beyond our ethnicity, economic status, our belief system. All that pales in comparison to life and death, in terms of what connects us as human beings.\"\n\n\"It's something that is so much a part of our lives,\" Smith adds, \"Thinking of what will happen. We've all lost people, have had people pass away, and we all wish some of them would come back.\" Smith, who portrayed Red Forman from That 70's Show, says that what drew him to the show was the idea of dealing with what happens when the people you've lost actually do come back. \"You have to deal with how your life has changed since that person left.

One reason cited for this is that the water rationing exercise could have disrupted manufactured exports in Selangor and Negri Sembilan between February and April. That is a lot of money down the drain and, more to the point, quite inexplicable given that the country receives an average of 98 inches (249 cm) of rain a year.\n\nLike everything that has demand, water is a resource - and should be treated as such. Selangor's water policy does not do this. By allowing Selangor residents to have their first 20 cubic metres of water free, it devalues the importance of a scarce and valuable resource.\n\nSelangor would do well to emulate Penang. The state did not need rationing but only because Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng bit the bullet and raised water tariffs. At 311 litres per person per day, the state's consumption of water is the highest in the nation. The national average is 211 litres, which is bad enough. Such consumption, Mr Lim pointed out correctly, \"is unsustainable and, left unchecked, Penang will have no choice but to resort to water rationing in the future\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hath not a banker hands, organs, affections, passions? If you prick a banker, does he not bleed? If you tickle a banker, does he not laugh? A banker would say yes, but not everyone would agree. And the Singapore Repertory Theatre's contemporary staging of The Merchant of Venice won't help his case either.\n\nThe sixth annual Shakespeare in the Park production takes the 16th-century story of Antonio, a Venetian Christian merchant who owes a pound of flesh to Jewish moneylender Shylock, and transposes it to the turbulent financial markets of today.\n\nVenetian merchants are transformed into rapacious stockbrokers and hedge fund managers. Venetian noblewomen morph into trendy trust fund babes. And the Jewish moneylenders, much-reviled in Shakespeare's time, are replaced by modern Indian creditors.\n\nAs the Venetian Christians are played by mostly Caucasian and Eurasian actors, while the Jews are played by Indian actors, one wonders if British director Bruce Guthrie is taking a swipe at the ugly side of UK's financial industry where racial discrimination is said to be covert but rampant.\n\nA brief scene where a group of white bankers stand together as one spits on an Indian banker speaks volumes. Thankfully, Shylock the moneylender is played by the wonderful Singapore actor Remesh Panicker who lends tremendous dignity and humanity to his otherwise pathetic role. In his exquisitely tailored sherwani and crisp English accent, he is the very picture of an Indian immigrant made good in a world dominated by white bankers.\n\nHis swift and unexpected parody of how the other characters view Indians, using a thick lilting accent and wobbling head, is a cutting reminder of the extant racism against his people.\n\nCompared to him, the Christian Venetian characters are very hard to like. They appear intoxicated by their easy, hedonistic lifestyles and are impervious to the real world. English actor Daniel Jenkins plays Antonio as an arrogant Gordon Gekko-ish character, while Eurasian actress Julie Wee plays the heroine Portia as a sexy, impatient woman who's accustomed to getting what she wants.\n\nWhen she succeeds in releasing Antonio from his debt to Shylock and then stripping Shylock of his livelihood, one does not share in her triumph or, for that matter, the triumphs of any of prodigal Christian Venetians.\n\nBy setting the story in the world of finance, director Guthrie has conjured a cold and cynical world that is short on likeable characters and humour. The few attempts at providing comic relief through Launcelot Gobbo, the clown, fails miserably because local actor Sean Lai is dreadful at delivering jokes.\n\nOne ends up rooting for the glorious Panicker as Shylock and disliking everyone else - which might have been fine if not for the fact that Shylock is just one of the major characters.\n\nThe Merchant of Venice is now on at Fort Canning Park till May 25, 7.30pm daily, except Tuesday.

The current preference (I hesitate to call it a craze) in wine is Burgundy, red Burgundy rather than white. At the current rate of sales and consumption two predictable things are going to occur. The most obvious is that prices will go up and this prophecy has indeed come to pass.\n\nPrices are astronomical in the secondary market. One bottle of Musigny 2005, Domaine Christophe Roumier, will set you back more than $1,000. And the wine is still not fully mature. The other inevitable outcome is that some wines have virtually been completely consumed. Except for the rare bottles still being preciously hoarded, availability (which means stock) is rapidly declining.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I have been deliberately seeking out wines in my cellar, some of which I have not tasted since tasting them en primeur (my reference to Vieux Chateau Certan 2007 in last week's column. Three evenings ago, I pulled out a Chateau Lynch Bages 2004 which I had not even tried en primeur. Why this wine? For no better reason than I have known Jean-Michel Cazes (and his wines) since my introduction to Bordeaux some thirty-odd vintages ago and have confidence in his wine whatever the vintage.

We are extremely proud of the result and extremely confident. The improvement in the range affects all of our classes and not only first,\" he added.\n\nAir travel in Asia is set to take off as growing middle classes take to the skies, prompting increasing competition for well-heeled passengers, and industry expert Didier Brechemier, of the Roland Berger Strategy consultancy, said that \"first class is a tool in terms of image\".\n\nThe launch came days after the Emirati airline Etihad revealed a first-class sofa that converts into a bed extending 2.04m long and 66cm wide, which will go into Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 planes.\n\nSingapore Airlines currently boasts the most spacious first-class seat, which it revealed in July last year at 2.08m by 90cm.\n\nFirst class occupies just a sliver of the air-travel market, with Air France's 52,000 such customers a year representing an occupancy rate of 38 per cent, 0.3 per cent of total long-haul passengers and 1.8 per cent of long-haul revenue, said Bruno Matheu, head of Air France's passenger business.\n\nBut with return ticket prices averaging 9,000 euros across the company's network, the luxury seats are highly profitable and he said that they \"generate more revenue than if we filled that space with economy or business-class seats\". - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Unfortunately, the film never comes close to realising its comic potential, giving way instead to a sense that something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nThe comedy is lame, the pranks are painfully crude and Bad Neighbors is merely, well, bad.\n\nA clash of cultures occurs when young 30-somethings learning to cope with parenthood are compelled to unleash their inner adolescent in order to face off against a bunch of college kids with raging hormones and undisguised juvenile tendencies.

It was a nasty fate that befell British comedian John Cleese when he split from his third wife a few years ago. In 2011, he embarked on a one-man show - aptly dubbed The Alimony Tour - to help pay the bills and three years on, he's still making the rounds in order to replenish his retirement fund and provide a nest-egg for his children.\n\nOn the plus side, however, the divorce - along with a lifetime of comic memories - provided ample material which the writer, actor and tall person (as described on his website) put to good use in front of a packed house during An Evening with John Cleese at the NUS Cultural Centre last Sunday night.\n\nThe show, the first of a two-night run in Singapore and presented in the form of a monologue on his life and career, went down favourably with the audience, many of them die-hard Monty Python and Fawlty Towers fans. With deadpan humour and in typical self-deprecating fashion Cleese, 74, strolled down memory lane, reminiscing about his life and 50-plus years at the forefront of British comedy, aided by faded photographs and decades-old movie and television clips. Family, friends, fellow Pythons and at least one former wife (Connie Booth) featured prominently during the evening.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The market reacted earlier in anticipation of more quota coming out. That sort of set the stage,\" he said, adding that while the throngs of people at the showroom had increased over the past two weekends, customers had been mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude so far.\n\nWith more significant corrections to COE premiums for categories A and B now vis-a-vis a month ago, customers should be more inclined to sign on the dotted line, he reckoned.\n\nThe decline in premiums followed an earlier $6,065 decrease to $71,335 for Cat A and a hefty $9,494 drop to $75,010 for Cat B in the second round of bidding in April.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase of $3,411 in the premium for Category C (goods vehicles and buses) was seen as an upward correction from the last round of bidding at end-April, when that category fell by about a third.\n\nThis was partly because the new early turnover scheme, which encourages the early replacement of old Cat C diesel vehicles with those that match Euro V diesel standards, had led to insufficient stock.\n\n\"With the stock situation improving and the return of sales, that ended up pushing the premium back up,\" added Mr Lim.\n\nCOE premiums have been on a downward trend since the government announced that the COE quota for May to July would rise about 32 per cent over the previous three months, thanks to higher vehicle deregistrations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And of the remaining 41 per cent or 14.6 ha, about half (7.4 ha) was returned to JTC before the expiry of tenure, mainly due to the completion of replacement buildings for some companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the occupancy rate of ready-built facilities (RBFs) remained healthy at 94.8 per cent, declining marginally by 0.1 percentage point from the previous quarter, said JTC.\n\nNet allocation of RBFs, however, remained in the negative territory of 4,400 sq m, as gross allocation fell from 16,300 sq m to 13,900 sq m and returns stood at 18,300 sq m in Q1.\n\nJTC's many RBFs in the pipeline include JTC MedTech One @ MedTech Hub, JTC CleanTech Two @ CleanTech Park and JTC LaunchPad @one-north, all of which are slated for completion by end 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The number of rooms for the refurbished hotel has yet to be finalised as it will hinge on the incoming operator's proposal but is likely to be in the 200-300 room range. In addition, the first three levels of the 10-storey freehold building will comprise about 63,000 sq ft of lettable retail space, primarily for food and beverage (F&B) use.\n\nThe hotel will be shut in the third to fourth quarter of this year for the spruce-up, which is expected to be completed in early 2016.\n\nKishin RK, CEO of RB Capital Group, said: \"The rejuvenation of Robertson Quay will be anchored by a new upscale boutique hotel along the historic Singapore River. We envision a hospitality experience tailored to the needs of today's discerning business and leisure travellers.\"\n\nAdjoining the Singapore Central Business District, the Orchard Road shopping belt and cultural sites such as Chinatown, the hotel is ideally situated for business and leisure travellers and is a unique opportunity for the selected hotel operator to to introduce its brand in Singapore.\n\nSaid Tasos Kousloglou, senior vice-president, asset management, JLL, Hotels & Hospitality: \"The new hotel will be an exciting addition to Singapore's hotel landscape and RB Capital's hospitality portfolio. We are very excited to work for RB Capital, one of the most dynamic hospitality and commercial real estate developers in Singapore to select the suitable operator and brand for the hotel. Choosing the right brand and operator . . . is paramount to the project's success as well as the hotel's profitability and asset value.\"\n\nRB Capital recently opened the 442-room Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay at Magazine Road. Another hotel, the 300-room Park Hotel Farrer Park, is slated to open in late 2016.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There was also an enlarged unit base due to the private placement of 68.75 million units in May 2013 and the issuance of 92.5 million units under a rights issue in March 2014.\n\nThe trust said that excluding the effects from the recent rights issue, DPU for the fourth quarter and full year would have been 2.95 cents and 10.97 cents respectively - both higher than last year.\n\nGross revenue in Q4 climbed 23.8 per cent to $29.5 million. It included a property tax recovery of $1.8 million from 20 Gul Way for the period from Oct 29, 2012 to Dec 31, 2013.\n\nNonetheless, the year-on-year growth in gross revenue was driven by higher contribution from 20 Gul Way, higher rental rates and recoveries amounting to $400,000 from 27 Penjuru Lane, as well as higher revenue of $300,000 from 56 Serangoon North Avenue 4.

Full-year net property income rose by a fifth to $71.9 million.\n\nSaid chief executive officer Koh Wee Lih: \"In FY2014, we made significant progress growing our portfolio and strengthening our net property income which rose 20 per cent year on year.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect an even stronger performance, led by full income contribution from our 49 per cent-owned Optus Centre in Australia; rental income from our redevelopment at 103 Defu Lane; and higher contribution from Phases 2E and 3 at 20 Gul Way, which are developing at a faster rate than expected and likely to be completed by end this year.\"\n\nHe added that the trust remained committed to asset enhancement and property acquisition opportunities in Singapore and that unitholders have been duly rewarded despite the fall in fourth-quarter DPU.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, the Reit closed unchanged at $1.42.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Koay took over the helm in 2012 from Chin Yau Seng, who is now senior vice-president (sales & marketing). Mr Chin had assumed the role from Tony Davis in 2011.\n\nBringing in a seasoned SIA veteran - at a point when the budget carrier is sinking deeper into the red - is probably a calculated move, industry observers noted. Major shareholder SIA owns a 40 per cent stake in Tigerair.\n\n\"He (Mr Lee) has been tested in demanding assignments during his 20-year career in SIA,\" Tigerair said in a statement. \"He brings with him a wealth of experience at the senior level in the airline industry.\"\n\nMr Lee has held various appointments in SIA, including senior vice-president of corporate planning and regional vice-president for North Asia. He was also previously a director with SIA's wholly owned budget carrier, Scoot.\n\nMr Koay, 48, will serve as an adviser to the board and remain a non-executive director until Tigerair's annual general meeting on July 31.\n\nThe group has been struggling with a challenging operating environment, as overcapacity in the region hurt Tigerair Singapore and its associates faced intensifying competition at home.\n\nDuring Mr Koay's 21-month tenure, Tigerair kick-started restructuring efforts, which included slashing underperforming routes, right-sizing its fleet by grounding planes and cancelling an order for new aircraft, in addition to paring its stakes in its loss-making cubs while adopting an asset-light strategy.\n\n\"Turning around a company is a process and not an overnight activity,\" Mr Koay told The Business Times. \"Having laid the groundwork for the turnaround of Tigerair, it is now an appropriate time for me to hand over the reins. I am also glad that the company will be in good hands with Lik Hsin at the helm.\"\n\nMr Koay, a shipping industry veteran who was formerly a director at Kuok Group-linked Pacific Carriers and PaxOcean Engineering, oversaw a 60 per cent stake sale in Tigerair Australia to Virgin Australia, as well as the divestment of the group's 40 per cent interest in Tigerair Philippines to Cebu Pacific.\n\nTigerair has acknowledged that it is reconsidering its investment in bleeding cub Tigerair Mandala, amid reports that Garuda subsidiary Citilink could be sniffing around.\n\nUOB Kay Hian analyst K Ajith reckons that a key role of the incoming chief executive would be to stem the cash bleed, which SIA will be keen to see happen as well. \"(The group) has to focus on the Singapore operations, streamline (capacity) if need be, and minimise the cash burn. Much of the cash burn is happening at the associate level.\"\n\nFor the fourth quarter of the recently concluded financial year, its most established unit, Tigerair Singapore, turned in an operating loss of $29.4 million, compared to an operating profit of $21.5 million a year earlier, as revenue and yields declined.\n\nMr Ajith also wondered if it was prudent for the group to have exposed itself to risks by providing guarantees for its associates, given Mandala Airlines' (as it was previously known) own debt-related issues in the past.\n\n\"Why is Tigerair only now considering divesting Tigerair Mandala?\" he added.\n\nIn a research note, CAPA - Centre for Aviation noted that while there should be improvements over the medium to long run, the group's short-term outlook remained cloudy. Efforts to build partnerships and boost connection traffic will probably remain secondary to the group's primary focus to regain its financial footing.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, Tigerair shares closed unchanged at 40.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was arrived at after outstanding loans on their old flats were paid off, and after the new SAs were fully paid for.\n\nSAs thus make a lot of sense for seniors who are left with larger flats after their children move out to their own flats, he said.\n\nIf they choose to stay put in their old flats, they can rent out the available rooms.\n\nWhether they get sale proceeds or earn rental income, these monies are valuable for their retirement needs, the minister added.\n\nFinancial help aside, SAs come equipped with elderly-friendly fixtures such as grab bars and emergency alarm systems. They are also conveniently located within HDB towns, which gives senior citizens access to a wide range of public facilities, including Senior Activity Centres that run day programmes for them.\n\nSAs are also attractive to seniors who are living alone and find maintaining a large flat a chore, Mr Khaw pointed out.\n\nA study by his ministry of the 7,600 households which booked SAs between 2006 and last year yielded the following trends:\n\nMr Khaw wrote that although seniors lived alone in their SAs, they still needed family and community support. He promised that his ministry would be on a constant lookout for ways to promote positive and active ageing.\n\n\"We are taking SAs a step further by weaving them into integrated developments, like in Kampung Admiralty, for which we broke ground recently. The two blocks of SAs there will have easy access to a hawker centre, public plaza, healthcare, childcare and elder-care services all under the same roof. The co-location is deliberate to promote inter-generational interaction and bonding with their children and grandkids.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The average price achieved is slightly in excess of $1,030 psf.\n\nThe group said it plans to launch later this year two Singapore private residential projects - Seventy St Patrick's and another development in Upper Paya Lebar.

The quarterly payout will increase to nine cents a share from six cents starting in the September quarter. The share repurchase programme will be completed by Dec 31, 2016.\n\nAfter a US$58 billion run of losses last decade, US airlines are trying to make themselves more attractive to investors. Southwest Airlines is also poised to increase dividends this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Alaska Air Group raised its dividend by 25 per cent in February to 25 cents.\n\n\"Thirty-five years since deregulation, they've gotten to the point that they are going to be creating wealth instead of destroying wealth,\" Michael Derchin, an analyst with CRT Capital Group, said.\n\n\"It's nice to see them compete on returns to shareholders instead of cutting each others' throats through fare wars,\" he added. \"It's a different kind of competition.\"\n\nDelta restarted its dividend last year, following a decade-long break punctuated by bankruptcy and the biggest acquisition in its history, as part of an effort to return US$1 billion to stockholders. The company later rejoined the Standard & Poor's 500 Index after being dropped in 2005 ahead of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nAnalysts had been forecasting a buyback programme closer in size to the US$500 million share repurchase plan Delta announced a year ago. Delta rose 0.4 per cent to US$37.69 at the Tuesday close in New York. That pushed its increase this year to 37 per cent, topping the Standard & Poor's 500 Index's one per cent gain.\n\nAndrew Davis at T Rowe Price Group, said he thought Delta potentially could have repurchased US$2 billion in stock. Most investors probably thought US$1 billion was more likely, he said. \"It's a fantastic example of what the airlines should do,\" said Mr Davis.\n\nDelta's new dividend will give it a yield of about one per cent, which is about what most industrial companies try to provide, Mr Davis said.\n\nDelta's two largest US-based rivals, American Airlines Group and United Continental Holdings, will probably hold off on returning some of their cash until at least next year, Michael Derchin said.\n\nAmerican is still working to integrate its operations with US Airways after merging last year. \"There is an awful lot of work to be done,\" Mr Derchin said, including linking the two reservation systems. \"Until they get that behind them, I think it might be prudent to hold onto their cash.\"\n\nUnited, which posted the only first-quarter loss among major US carriers, will probably wait to increase its dividend or buy back shares until it improves its performance, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

M1, SingTel, StarHub and Consistel are working closely together to make this happen,\" the three operators and Consistel said in a joint response to BT's queries yesterday.\n\nPhilippe Collin Delavaud, CEO of SportsHub Pte Ltd - the group contracted to build and operate the facility - also told BT: \"We are satisfied that Consistel and the mobile telecom operators have come together to provide mobile coverage for Sports Hub. This agreement will deliver a good customer and spectator experience.\"\n\nMuch of the arrangement between Consistel and the telcos is shrouded in confidentiality clauses. Even so, BT understands that agreements have been reached on the leasing fee that the mobile operators will have to pay for Consistel's equipment. These agreements are likely to have been negotiated one- on-one between each telco and Consistel.\n\nThe leasing fee was reportedly among the sticking points of the negotiations, which have dragged on since mid-2013.\n\nFor its communications needs, the Sports Hub is using the \"neutral hosting\" model. Under this arrangement, Consistel builds and hosts the Sports Hub's wireless systems, including the 3G and 4G equipment in the facility. It then leases the use of this equipment to operators such as SingTel, StarHub and M1.\n\nIn January, however, it was reported that the telcos and Consistel could not agree on the leasing price. There was also disagreement over the service standards to be met.\n\nBy then, the situation had deteriorated to the point where the three operators were compelled to release a rare joint statement which pointedly said: \"The deployment of mobile networks is a challenging process, especially if there are terms and conditions imposed by building owners which may create delays in implementation.\"\n\nAs soft-launch events at the Sports Hub loomed in April, the regulator, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), had to publicly intervene in January, urging the parties involved to work something out.\n\nBy March, the telcos and Consistel remained locked in discussions, even as IDA told them to roll out mobile services by the time the Sports Hub opens to the public in mid-June.\n\nResponding to the latest development of deals being reached yesterday, an IDA spokesman said: \"IDA notes that the parties have agreed to work together to provide mobile coverage at Sports Hub. IDA expects good mobile coverage to be provided by the first public event.\"\n\nWhile the Sports Hub was due to open in April, complexities in the building of its National Stadium saw this milestone morphing into a series of openings staggered over three phases.\n\nThe last phase is slated for June. Then, three events will take place in different parts of the Sports Hub: the SEA Swimming Championships 2014; the 6th World University Floorball Championship; and the World Club 10s rugby tournament.\n\nAt their largest, events like these are set to be high-density affairs. The National Stadium, which will host the World Club 10s, already seats 55,000 on its own.\n\nIn less than two months' time, thousands of people will throng the Sports Hub's premises - all of them expecting to make phone calls, upload photos or watch videos on the mobile coverage that has been promised.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

First, China's dominant e-commerce company is huge, and could be even bigger. Second, new investors will have little say in how it is run - the founders are keeping a firm grip.\n\nLast year, Alibaba processed 11.3 billion orders with a value of US$248 billion through its main sites, Taobao and Tmall. That's two-thirds more than Amazon and Ebay combined, and a staggering 84 per cent of China's total online shopping haul. Unlike most online retailers, Alibaba doesn't sell or deliver goods itself. Instead, it acts as a shop-front, charging sellers for advertising and taking some commissions.\n\nGrowth will come from two sources: increased online shopping, and Alibaba extracting more money from sellers. Its revenue of US$7.8 billion in calendar year 2013 amounted to just 3 per cent of goods sold. By comparison, Ebay's take is 10 per cent. Alibaba's orders tend to be small - averaging around US$22 apiece versus US$64 for rival online retailer JD.com.

This translated to earnings of 4.9 cents per share for the quarter, compared to 5.3 cents in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell 1.5 per cent to $571 million, due to lower service revenue and fewer sales of handsets.\n\nIn particular, sales of broadband services fell 13.7 per cent to $53.9 million. StarHub gained market share, but has been edging into a competitive market in this area, said CEO Tan Tong Hai at a media briefing. As a reflection of this, the average revenue per user (Arpu) for broadband services in the quarter fell $6 to $39.\n\nSales of its mobile services inched up 1.3 per cent to $306 million compared to a year ago, lifted by higher subscription revenue from a larger subscriber base and an increased mix of subscribers on tiered data subscription plans.\n\nBut Arpu from mobile services after stripping out pre-paid mobile services fell $2 over the year to $66. This also comes as all three telcos agreed last month not to charge customers with current contracts for the 4G service.\n\nResponding to a query on the impact of this, chief commercial officer Kevin Lim said the mobile business will continue to grow in spite of this delay in revenue coming through.\n\n\"We respect the wishes of the regulators,\" said Mr Lim. \"Our growth is not predicated on a single package. We will adjust accordingly.\"\n\nSales from its pay TV services were down one per cent at $93.8 million, dragged down by lower subscription sales, as StarHub offered re-contract packages at more attractive rates, and as it registered a drop in ad sales, said Mr Tan. But Arpu from this business segment held steady at $52.\n\nStarHub recommended a dividend of five cents per share for the first quarter. Shares of StarHub closed down 0.24 per cent yesterday to end at $4.17.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

NSL sold its interest in the associate company in December last year.\n\nThe disposal of the Bangkok Synthetics stake was also reflected in the $9.96 million gain under exceptional items in the quarter, a significant jump from the $1.72 million gain booked in the year-ago period.\n\nNSL recorded the largest part of sales from its construction business, but the division contributed the second-smallest profit on a pre-tax basis when compared to its other segments.\n\nThe company said the pre-cast operations business within the construction division are expected to be challenging across the region.

Its lead director Imelda Tanoto told BT it was simultaneously in negotiations with possible EPC contractors, including from Asia and Europe, to build the project, even as it is discussing with potential LNG buyers including those in Japan, China, South Korea and Singapore, the last including with Temasek-owned Pavilion Energy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
