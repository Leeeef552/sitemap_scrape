By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIAN Fong is the sort who moves house every few years, and each one looks vastly different from the previous. Some years ago, he lived in a HDB terrace home at Whampoa which was done up in an eclectic and English style. When he moved into his current home, a one-bedroom apartment in Cairnhill in 2010, he did up the place in a modern and somewhat minimalist look. Four years on, Mr Fong, the CEO of Sirius Art, has decided to stay put in this apartment. \"This is the longest that I have lived in one apartment, as I have grown to like the place,\" he says.\n\nHe was set on this one-bedder when he was house-hunting back then. At 818 sq ft in size, it is a fairly large one. \"It has a big living room which is good, especially when I have friends over,\" he says. \"But yet at the same time, it is small enough, so that I have an excuse not to let friends sleep over.\"\n\nHe says while he welcomes friends, he draws a line at letting them stay the night. \"I can't be myself then,\" he says. \"My friends know that although I'm an extrovert, I am still quite reserved.\"\n\nBut since he has decided not to move, a revamp was in order for the apartment. Last year, he changed the look by rearranging the furniture and adding new ones.\n\nA number of designer chairs dot the apartment, despite Mr Fong saying that he does not collect chairs but buys them simply because he loves them. \"I appreciate beautiful design, and I respect timeless classics, so I am willing to spend on them,\" he says.\n\nOne of his favourite pieces is Arne Jacobsen's Egg chair. Mr Fong first saw it 20 years ago, but could not afford one then. \"If I can't afford a piece, I will not buy a knock-off,\" he says. He bought the chair recently, and decided to go with the one in tan leather, despite it costing three times more than the fabric version. It comes as a surprise when Mr Fong confesses that the chair \"isn't very comfortable. You cannot lounge in it\". For a period of time, he could not believe that he had spent a five figure sum on the chair. \"But it will not ever look outdated, and I can pass it down to my niece and nephew. So this is my heirloom piece,\" he says, justifying what he calls his most insane purchase.\n\nAnother Arne Jacobsen piece he has is the Series 7, used as a dining chair. \"Again, I picked this because I appreciate Scandinavian design. It is functional yet aesthetically pleasing, and made of wood, which complements the home,\" he says. Unfortunately, the seat suffered a scratch after a particular dinner party, but Mr Fong brushes it off. \"Of course, it pains my heart, but, it is just too bad,\" he says. He is better able to tolerate scratches on the floor, as \"they give a lived in feel\".\n\nHis favourite spot in the home is the sofa, where the TV addict can indulge in his pastime. \"When I was a child, and there was no cable TV then, I used to watch everything on TV, even the Malay and Tamil programmes, just so that I could avoid doing homework,\" he says, These days, he is more likely to be watching \"anything from legal dramas to sci-fi, to Channel 8 drama serials\".\n\nMr Fong's appreciation for well-designed pieces extends to his choice of home accessories. One conversation piece is a limited edition wooden crate from Cassina, designed by Le Corbusier. Mr Fong gushes about the smooth finishing, and the flawless joinery. He says excitedly that while it looks like a fancy crate, it can be used as a side table, a low chair or as a foot stool. \"Some friends love it so much that they want to get one too, while others think I'm crazy for buying this.\"\n\nSharp-eyed visitors will notice several animal accessories around the home, such as the Eames House Bird, the Magis Puppy, and a rooster perching on a stand. \"I trained in zoology, although I never practised,\" he says.\n\nOn the TV console is a red plastic toy car, from British label Playforever. \"The red makes it look like it doesn't fit in with the rest of the apartment, and I like throwing in surprises like that,\" says Mr Fong.\n\nThe bachelor also gives his personal touch to the home by displaying family photos in his bedroom. \"There are some of me from my younger days, some with my niece and nephew. I am constantly adding new ones.\"\n\nMr Fong's eye for detail goes beyond furnishings to the hardware. Rather than paint the walls, he prefers wallpaper. One wall in the living room is covered with textured, black wallpaper, while the opposite wall shows off a striped pattern. The apartment's white laminate cupboards were replaced with black ones that have a slight leather finish. \"To me, it is not just the colour that matters, but the texture as well.\"\n\nBlack features mostly in the apartment, and the colour initially did not go down well with Mr Fong's father. \"He kept asking me if I was sure about it, especially when black is an unusual colour for the living room. But he likes the end result,\" says Mr Fong. \"I had to reassure him that I knew what I was doing.\"\n\nThe apartment's revamped look makes it look cosy, but Mr Fong says he would rather not put a label on it. \"Let's just say this the Ian Fong look.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the low ticket price of $10, you get to wander its classic colonial halls, and stumble into a dance club, a lover's quarrel, a cleaner's monologue, an alternate history tour, and even a horror story or two.\n\nThe lover's quarrel, incidentally, will be played three times, each time by a different couple - just in case, you know, you can't get enough of it. (Of course, you don't have to watch all three performances.)\n\nMeanwhile, the cleaner's monologue will be performed by Siti Khalijah Zainal, the white-hot comedian who's the latest addition to the cast of popular sketch-show The Noose. And the strange guided tour - well, let's just leave it at \"strange\".\n\nConceived by award-winning playwright and director Chong Tze Chien, The Arts House is marking its 10-year milestone by, well, \"disappearing\". It wants to imagine a scenario in an alternate universe where The Arts House has been replaced by a dance club or a mega bookstore.\n\nAnd, considering how other old buildings such as Capitol and Rex Cinemas have been taken over and refurbished for other commercial purposes, it's an alternate reality that's not all that hard to imagine.\n\nThe Arts House itself is housed in a 200-year-old building that was formerly Singapore's first Parliament House, before being renovated in 2002 and converted into The Arts House on March 26, 2004.\n\nAs director William Phuan explains: \"We are playing with the concept: can the absence of The Arts House make the heart grow fonder?\"\n\nApart from the immersive visual and performance installation show within the building, there will be concerts on March 28 and 29 on the lawn, with a line-up of Singapore musicians, including Gareth Fernandez, Nick Chim and Natalie Hiong. There will also be an audio-visual installation featuring 30 recordings of poems about places in Singapore read by the poets themselves, including Arthur Yap, Alfian Sa'at and Edwin Thumboo.\n\nThe Arts House anniversary programmes run from March 26 to April 6.

By Rachel Loi and Chew Hui-Yan\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S easy to say that you want to become healthy and fit, but trying to find the right wellness plan could well stymie your best intentions. First, you need to find the right gym. Then, what diet to follow. And where to find a doctor who can give you good advice. Or a nutritionist, a physiotherapist or even a yoga instructor?\n\nApart from big wellness centres like COMO Shambhala or Veritas Spa, more independent health-related businesses are joining forces to offer one-stop holistic programmes to make the transition to good health a logistical breeze.\n\nTake Ian Tan - co-founder of Ritual Gym - who has a personal interest in exploring all healthy avenues apart from his specialist fitness centre. Since he started Ritual early last year with his partners, Mr Tan has come across other small outfits with a similar vision of providing quality healthcare and services.\n\nHe has since teamed up with physiotherapists, local eateries and even a small family-owned American shoe company which makes minimalist shoes that help keep your feet healthy, to create a network of services for his clients, mainly Singaporeans or expatriates working in the CBD. Their programmes have already gained traction, says Mr Tan, adding that their list of seven restaurants serving \"Ritual style\" meals - served with more vegetables and less carbohydrates - will soon double due to interest from eateries as well as clients' demands. It's basically a value-added service for clients, as the gym only stands to gain more awareness, explains Mr Tan. \"Since we're interested in this, why not point people in the right direction so they don't have to waste time learning about this stuff on their own,\" he reasons.\n\nSharing his view is Adeline Tan of LINS Smoodees, who started her green smoothie business in 2010, and recently teamed up with local clinical and holistic nutrition company Biotailor, as well as certified yoga instructor Johnson Anand Saurabh. Together they are planning a programme called the LINS Energy Detox Series, in line with Ms Tan's ultimate goal to be a concierge to her clients and help them find the services they are looking for, since there is a limit to what she can provide. \"It's out of passion anyway,\" she explains. \"I was always driven by 'kaypoh-ness' to make referrals and recommendations, because people were always coming to me and asking where to get this or that done.\"\n\nAnother thing she notes is that there has been growing public interest in this area, with more Singaporeans aware of their own health. Echoing her view are the owners of Afterglow, who have also noticed more Singaporeans taking charge of their health. The lifestyle and food concept started off as a vegetarian deli but has now expanded to even organising a yoga farm tour in March, which will take place at local organic farm Quan Fa. \"When we talk to customers who come in and mention they do yoga and things like that, we thought why not tie everything together?\" says Carmen Low, co-founder of Afterglow. \"People are genuinely interested in these things, which are sorely lacking in Singapore.\" According to Ms Low, their community started with the intention of making a healthy lifestyle accessible to people, while at the same time expanding their own clientele. \"Because everybody knows that if you just focus on being a vegetarian place, you will alienate a lot of people. And I want people to actually like coming here,\" she explains.\n\nBut a more cautious voice against the trend comes from nutritionist Dana Heather of Balanced Living - a wellness centre offering consultations, workshops, as well as a healthy food joint called The Living Caf\u00e9. She prefers to engage overseas experts to conduct her talks and workshops instead of teaming up with local businesses because she feels the players in the Singapore wellness industry still lack proper information to back up their practices.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of new kids on the block that are finding things like detoxification a trendy little thing,\" says Ms Heather, 49, who holds a pre-med degree and a masters in holistic nutrition. \"They're like: 'Let's do a cleanse here and a cleanse there', but they don't really know what they're doing. Information can change a life, not trendy things. So it should not be about the latest health trend, it should be about the shift in consciousness and awareness. They should be looking at empowerment through education,\" she adds.\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/made-me", "site_title": "Made by me", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMade by me\n\nThe cottage industry is alive and well in Singapore, with several small scale businesses growing out of passion and hobbyist ventures. By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNOWADAYS, when it's so easy to buy things off the shelf or online made by yet another big manufacturer, the sight of something made by hand is bound to attract attention and appreciation. At the Made in SG Market held over the weekend at the National Design Centre, the crowds who thronged the site could not get enough of these hand-made products, touching them and chatting with their makers. Sparking off hopes that the cottage industry has a welcome place in Singapore, BT Weekend speaks to a group of people who are driving this movement with their bare hands.\n\nGSH Conserves\n\nwww.gshconserves.com\n\nPOP quiz: name a local jam that is not kaya. If you are hard-pressed for an answer, don't be. After all, most jams sold at supermarkets are often made with imported fruits; strawberries, Valencia oranges and such. Joey Gan, 31, a former conservation officer with the National Parks Board, wants to change that with his range of jams.\n\nCalled GSH Conserves, the jams he makes use only tropical fruit, such as lychee, dragonfruit, mango and passionfruit. GSH is an acronym of Mr Gan's Chinese name, Gan Soon Hock.\n\n\"I wanted to start something on my own, and found that the jam business is quite untouched in Singapore,\" says Mr Gan. \"Plus having my own line of jam complements the ever growing local baking scene.\"\n\nHe also noticed that there was a dearth of jam made from local or tropical fruits. By researching online, and after weeks of trial and error, he developed his own jam recipe.\n\nUsing tropical fruits meant that he could introduce new jam flavours to Singapore, and also do his bit for the environment by reducing the carbon footprint incurred when selecting local ingredients. He sources for his fruits from the Pasir Panjang wholesale centre. Jam making takes place in a kitchen in Macpherson.\n\nThe process involves cutting the fruits and boiling them to the right consistency. Some sugar is added to the mix, but Mr Gan leaves out any artificial preservatives. He also does the bottling himself.\n\nSince last October, he has been selling five types of jams: dragonfruit and lychee, pumpkin and cinnamon, passionfruit, mango and lime and sweet chilli dip. A 50ml jar costs $4, while the bigger 180ml jar retails for $10. Passionfruit is the best-seller.\n\nMr Gan produces about 60 to 80 bottles of jam each day. GSH Conserves are sold at Strictly Pastry cafe at Joo Chiat Road, Salad Stop! at Pasar Bella, The Gardens Shop at Singapore Botanic Gardens and Overdoughs Bakery in Middle Road.\n\nHe also retails at flea markets, such as the recent Made in SG Market at the National Design Centre, where he sold out 400 bottles of jam over two days.\n\nIt's a one-man show and Mr Gan admits that jam-making can sometimes get dull because it is a repetitive job. \"I'm doing this alone,\" he says. He is at the kitchen three times a week, five hours each time.\n\nThere are no plans yet to introduce new jams, but Mr Gan hopes to hire help, so that he can expand the business.\n\nHe believes that homemade jams like his have great appeal, because \"people are used to buying food off the shelves. But when they buy something that I've made, they get to meet the person behind the product too.\"\n\nGo nuts\n\nThe Hunters' Kitchenette\n\nwww.hunterskitchenette.com\n\nIT'S all about clean eating in the Salim household. \"We follow the Paleolithic diet, eating natural food that our ancestors ate when they were hunter-gatherers,\" says Herbert Salim, 38, an architect.\n\nNo processed food for his family of four and that extends even to their choice of bread spreads. Rather than buying off-the-shelf spreads, Mr Salim makes his own.\n\nFriends and family love what he has done, and together with his wife, Natalia, they recently started retailing their own brand of nut butters. The Hunters' Kitchenette range of nut butters include almond, macadamia, pistachio, cashew and hazelnut. The name is a play on the hunter-gatherer diet that the family is on.\n\nFrom 9pm to 1am, the couple are at a commercial kitchen in Macpherson, churning out the nut butters. Raw nuts, purchased from a local supplier, are roasted before they are ground into a buttery paste.\n\n\"We don't add any additional oil to the mixture. But we do add sea salt and coconut palm sugar to enhance the taste,\" says Mr Salim. \"There are no artificial preservatives added either.\" This means that the butters can only keep for three months once opened, compared to two years for commercially made ones.\n\nApart from producing the butters, the couple also do the bottling themselves, and are able to produce about 15 bottles of nut butter in an hour.\n\nThe nut butters cost from $12.50 a bottle, depending on the type of nut. Pistachio is the priciest of the lot at $17.50 a bottle, but it is also the best selling flavour.\n\nThe hazelnut butter came about as his children were fond of a particular commercial hazelnut chocolate spread. \"Unfortunately, sugar and palm oil are its two main ingredients, which is not good,\" he says. His hazelnut spread has some cocoa powder in it, and tastes more natural too.\n\nThe nut butters are currently on sale at Takashimaya food hall till tomorrow, and he also sells them at the Farmers' Market at The Pantry at Loewen Gardens.\n\n\"The expatriate crowd is familiar with nut butters, but for the locals, this is still something new,\" he says.\n\nFlavours in the works include pecan and walnut, and even a mixture of nuts. Once, a customer asked for him to mix almonds, macadamias, pistachios, cashew and hazelnuts all into one spread. \"It turned out surprisingly good,\" he says. He adds that he can make customised nut butters too.\n\nFor now, this is a sideline business, but Mr Salim is passionate about it. \"It is heartening to know that I can make something good for others as well.\"\n\nAll fired up\n\nWeekend Worker\n\nweekendworker.sg\n\nMOST people are likely to spend their weekends chilling out at cafes or spending the day at the mall, but not this trio of friends - Ivan Lee, Ong Su Loon and Chloe Tan.\n\nYou are more likely to find them in a studio in Changi, that is so hidden away, it cannot be located on Google maps.\n\nThe three form Weekend Worker, a ceramics collective that creates pieces that are simple in design, yet have a distinctive look. \"We aim to take everyday objects and translate them into treasured experiences,\" says Ms Tan.\n\n\"We met about two years ago, when all of us were trying our hand at ceramics,\" says Ms Tan. \"Our frequent chats with each other drew us together to start Weekend Worker, a platform for us to share our craft with others who may be interested in ceramics.\"\n\nAll three have day jobs, which they declined to reveal. Ceramic production usually takes place over the weekends, hence the name.\n\nTheir studio is nothing fancy, save for three throwing wheels and an electric kiln for production and firing. \"Ceramics was the medium which brought the three of us together. It is a therapeutic routine which we enjoy - finding inspirations from daily objects and applying them onto our craft process and pieces,\" says Ms Tan.\n\nEach of them come up with their own creations, which are mostly cups and bowls. \"The pieces are all functional ware, because this is what we like to do, and along the way, we can use them ourselves too,\" says Ms Tan.\n\nFor example, Mr Lee once made an unusually large bowl that could hold two packets of instant noodles because there was not a bowl big enough in the market.\n\nMaking ceramics is not something that gives instant gratification, as after moulding the clay, the piece has to be left for almost two weeks to dry completely.\n\nOnce it has reached the bone dry state, it is then fired in the kiln, before a glaze is applied.\n\n\"The beauty of a handmade product is such that each product has a thought process, idea and story behind them,\" says Ms Tan. \"With the rise in popularity of locally designed and made products, we believe that the market for handmade products in Singapore is growing.\"\n\nWeekend Workers pieces retail at pop-up cafe, Compl(e)ments Of at Dunlop Street till March 28, and at Necessary Provision cafe at Eng Kong Terrace.\n\nMr Ong also has some pieces that he created on sale at online store, Haystakt. A textured bowl costs $70, while a marbled vase retails for $180.\n\nRefined craft\n\nThe J.Myers Company\n\nwww.jmyersco.com\n\nWITH its fancy sounding name, The J.Myers Company could easily be assumed to be an American brand, but it's really the name of a leather goods maker located in the heart of Chinatown.\n\n\"The name J.Myers is a pun on my name,\" says Jeremiah Ang, 30, who started the company about four years ago.\n\nIt was the hunt for a belt that led the former photographer's assistant to start the company. \"I wanted to buy a belt from an online shop, but shipping it here would cost me $300,\" recalls Mr Ang, who says that since his younger days, he was always trying to make things on his own.\n\nHe read up on leather crafting, bought himself some equipment, such as pliers, knives, stitching oil and leather hides, and made his first belt.\n\nBut that was not enough. \"The books only taught a rugged style of leather crafting,\" says Mr Ang. \"I'm more keen on the kind of leathercrafting that the luxury houses do.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Mr Ang found little resources in this area, and there was no craftsman that he could learn from. But he was undeterred. \"I would try different styles of stitching the leather, and then stand outside the Hermes shop window to compare my stitching with theirs,\" he says.\n\nThe self-taught leathergoods maker would also take apart old wallets to study how they were put together. For example, a bifold wallet could have 20 to 30 pieces of leather to put together. \"I had to learn how to fit all the pieces together to form a wallet. For example, the outer piece must be longer than an inner piece,\" says Mr Ang, who adds that even the thickness of the leather hide can make or break a piece.\n\nUsing the 'dissected' pieces of the wallet, he would draw up patterns, much like what a tailor does.\n\n\"Without a good pattern, the final result would not look right,\" he says.\n\nHe used to accept customised orders for leather bags from private clients, but no longer does that.\n\nThese days, he works with companies to create bespoke leather goods for their customers. His clients include Bentley, Lexus, and the Singapore Stock Exchange, for which he has designed and produced small leather goods such as cardholders, wallets and luggage tags.\n\nFor private clients, Mr Ang creates bespoke watch straps. \"Most watch dealers only have a small selection of straps. But I can customise one for them,\" he says. Wrist measurements are taken and Mr Ang creates straps patterns that are unique to each client.\n\nWhen it comes to choice of hides, Mr Ang uses calf and alligator, sourced from a local tannery. Clients can pick their choice of grain as well. Each watch strap takes about four to six weeks to complete, and costs from $160 for a calf hide strap and from $280 for an alligator one.\n\n\"I like working with leather, because the material has value,\" says Mr Ang. \"You can create leather pieces that have a heirloom quality.\"\n\nHis monthly paycheck goes towards new tools and leather hides. \"The business doesn't really pay well, but I do it because of passion.\"\n\nHome brew\n\nJungle Beer\n\nwww.junglebeer.com\n\nSEMBAWANG may be the last place you would expect to have a microbrewery, but it is home to Jungle Beer, which began selling craft beer in 2011.\n\nThe company was started by Adi Challa, 32, together with three college friends. \"I lived in the US and the UK and was interested in beers besides lagers,\" says the South Indian national.\n\nWith an interest in brewing his own beer, Mr Challa packed his bags, and headed to Edinburgh to study brewing, later working at a microbrewery there.\n\nThe four decided on Singapore as their location of choice to start a microbrewery. \"Back in 2009, the craft beer scene was just starting and we saw the potential of its rapid growth, and it also helped that we could find support from the government,\" says Mr Challa.\n\nThey spent 2010 looking for equipment and developing the business model, and by July 2011, they began retailing beer.\n\nToday, Jungle Beer offers six types of beers, each with a local sounding name, including Siloso Beach, Kiasu Stout, Quayside Coolie and Uncle Sam. Its two most popular beers are Singlish Ale, a strong English ale with caramel, and Orchard Road, which has hints of mango and orange with the sharpness of wheat beer.\n\nThe beer is brewed entirely in Singapore, using malt that is mostly imported from the UK, hops from the US and Britain, yeast from France, and good ole' tap water from Singapore.\n\nThe microbrewery produces 5,000 litres of beer a month, and Mr Challah says it can produce 12,000 litres if needed to.\n\nWhile some other microbreweries operate a bar on the premises, Mr Challa says Jungle Beer is solely a production brewery. \"We are not really into running a pub, and we have more confidence in the brewing business,\" he says.\n\nThe beer is sold in draught form and in bottles. Mr Challa also works with restaurants to produce bespoke beers.\n\nSlightly more than two years since running the microbrewery, the group realised that \"it is expensive to brew beer in Singapore\", says Mr Challa. The craft beer scene has also become more competitive with more imported beers being sold here. He hopes to find a location outside Singapore to start another microbrewery.\n\nBut passion keeps him in Singapore for now. Mr Challa, who was previously working in the service line, says that while he enjoyed his old job, it had \"intangible value\". But with beer brewing, it is a different story. \"I am creating a product, something that is tangible, and I know that people enjoy it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

BT's goal is to give BTInvest users a new way to not only view market data, but interact with it in a collaborative, immersive and risk-free way.\n\n\"The best way to learn how to invest is with real stocks, at real prices, in real time - but not with real money,\" said BT associate editor Vikram Khanna.\n\nThe TrakInvest platform also has a social element: Users can track and follow other successful traders and, if they wish, emulate their moves.

At night, it morphed into Afterglow, a bar serving alcohol and raw bites as well. But with its official opening this month and the widening of its business to include retailing toiletries and tie-ups with other health-related entities, the two partners decided to rebrand and just use the name Afterglow.\n\nThe first tie-up was with Thai organic toiletries company Urban Tree, which makes paraben and sulfate-free toiletries such as soap and shampoo, which Ms Low and Mr Ang sell at the deli. \"We believe that the stuff you put into your body and what you use externally does affect you,\" explains Ms Low.\n\nThe duo are constantly looking for partnerships that would complement the Afterglow philosophy. \"We look for like-minded people,\" adds Mr Ang.\n\nThey have also hooked up with yoga apparel brand lululemon athletica and organic farmers Quan Fa for yoga farm tours. The first tour on March 16 kicks off with a one-hour session of yoga by lululemon volunteer teachers on Quan Fa's farm located at Woodlands, followed by a tour of the farm grounds and a lesson on how to grow sunflower sprouts. Finally, Ms Low and Mr Ang will conduct a class on how to use the sprouts in salads. Depending on the success of this inaugural tour, the partners will decide whether to carry out more tours in the future.\n\nValenssa Lee, showroom manager for lululemon, is enthusiastic about working with Afterglow and Quan Fa on the tour. She says: \"We love to work with local businesses and support them. We are also trying to promote yoga as part of a healthy lifestyle.\"\n\nJun Jie, the business development manager of Quan Fa Organic Farm, explains: \"We supply Afterglow with fresh produce that they use at their deli.

We're happy to make a meaningful contribution to that. Measured by the protection value or sum assured, we have close to a quarter of the business.\n\n\"Growth in the protection business pretty much cuts across the board, from the mass market covering premature death, critical illness and medical insurance to the higher end of the market such as jumbo universal life . . . business.\"\n\nAIA Group, which released its annual results yesterday, reported that group operating profit after tax rose 16 per cent to US$2.5 billion.\n\nNet profits, which include marked-to-market movements from the equity portfolio, fell 7 per cent to US$2.8 billion, reflecting a decline in equity markets in the second half.\n\nThe group achieved a 25 per cent rise in VONB to US$1.49 billion; its VONB margin rose 0.5 of a percentage point to 44 per cent.\n\nOperating earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 20.91 US cents.\n\nThe board recommended a final dividend of 28.62 Hong Kong cents per share, subject to shareholders' approval; this takes the total dividend for 2013 to 42.55 Hong Kong cents per share, a 15 per cent increase over 2012.\n\nIn a statement, AIA group chief executive and president Mark Tucker said: \"Asia continues to provide one of the most attractive and resilient life insurance markets in the world. The demographic drivers in the region, coupled with low levels of social welfare provision and the rapid expansion in the numbers of middle and high-income households, provide enormous growth opportunities and all of this is happening at an unprecedented scale.\n\n\"AIA is exceptionally well positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, given the quality and scale of our distribution platform, our depth of experience . . . and our unrivalled financial strength.\"\n\nIn Singapore, Mr Tan said, the agency's force remains the main channel of distribution. The company now has some 4,000 agents, up from about 3,500 two years ago. Its recruitment programmes delivered a 44 per cent rise in the number of active new agents over that in 2012.\n\nLast year, when HSBC Insurance announced that it would cease selling products through tied agents, it was reported that AIA Singapore would offer jobs to about 400 HSBC agents.\n\nStandard & Poor's yesterday said its rating on the holding company AIA Group and its subsidiaries were unaffected by the group's results.\n\n\"We consider the group's financial flexibility to be strong, and believe that its capitalisation will remain supportive of the rating for the next two years.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This growth, however, was supported mainly by temporal cyclical factors. In view of this and the uncertain global outlook for 2014, the real GDP forecast range for the Singapore economy for 2014 is 2-4 per cent.\n\nThe tax changes announced in Budget 2014 fortify the efforts of businesses in their pursuit of increased productivity, which Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam described as core to quality growth.\n\nThe headline business tax change was in the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme, first introduced in the 2010 Budget.

Basel III requirements kicked in here last year, two years ahead of the international deadline of Jan 1, 2015.\n\nUOB's managing director and head of investor relations Jimmy Koh said: \"We welcome the government's efforts to provide certainty on the tax treatment of Basel III Additional Tier 1 instruments. With this certainty, we are likely to see more Basel III instruments issued in the market; investors will benefit from having more options to choose from.\"\n\nA DBS spokeswoman commented that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has always adopted a prudent, disciplined approach in supervising financial institutions, while preserving the industry's high level of competitiveness. Noting that Singapore banks are being required to comply with Basel III earlier and at higher standards than in other jurisdictions, she added: \"The tax deductibility for issuers of Basel III additional Tier 1 instruments is encouraging, as banks here (make the) transition to a Basel III regime.\"\n\nConsultants also agreed that the change removes uncertainty for tax purposes.\n\nAmy Ang, a financial services tax partner in Ernst & Young, said: \"For accounting, it remains equity, based on features of Basel III, but it is debt for tax purposes.\"\n\nPaul Lau, a financial services tax partner in PwC Singapore, said: \"It's good for the local banks, giving additional clarity in terms of treatment and it makes issuance of such instruments more efficient.\"\n\nOther changes for the sector were the rationalising of tax concessions and extending them for the fund-management industry for another five years.\n\nThe 2012 Singapore Asset Management Industry Survey by MAS noted that Singapore-based managers were managing $1.62 trillion in assets.\n\nLim Maan Huey, a PwC Singapore financial services tax partner, expressed hope that the extension and the enhancements would enable the $1.62 trillion figure to be breached quickly and establish for Singapore a greater market share in the global asset management arena.\n\nTo boost Singapore as an infrastructure business trust-listing destination, the tax-exemption for foreign-sourced interest for these listed entities has been expanded.\n\nMs Lim said: \"Singapore already has good treatment for business trusts; the issue was that it had conditions attached... This makes the listing process easier.\"\n\nThe Budget also extended the waiving of withholding tax requirements to non-banks - as has been done for banks since February 2012.\n\nTo reduce compliance costs for businesses, payers will no longer need to withhold tax on payments such as royalties and interest paid to the Singapore branches of non-resident companies.\n\nAlan Lau, a KPMG partner and head of financial services tax, said: \"It's win-win, the reduction of compliance costs is for the payer, while for the recipient, they don't have to face a cash-flow crunch.\"\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They will not last, and we should see a tighter Budget position in the coming years,\" said Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his annual Budget speech yesterday.\n\nPrivate sector economists were expecting a far fatter surplus, with predictions reaching up to $7 billion. But they did not foresee the larger-than-projected spending on special transfers that happened in FY2013.\n\nSpecial transfers, excluding top-ups to endowment and trust funds, swelled to $3.22 billion, almost two-and-a-half times the $1.3 billion estimated a year before. This was due to higher Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) Bonus and PIC cash payouts, as well as the bringing forward of the first tranche of the Wage Credit Scheme payout to FY2013.\n\nRevised figures for FY2013 show that operating revenue hit $57.15 billion - 3.9 per cent or $2.12 billion more than estimated - with stamp duties and vehicle quota premiums as the main drivers behind the increase.\n\nDespite several rounds of cooling measures which have reduced overall demand somewhat, the property market remained firmer than the government had expected. As a result, stamp duty collections exceeded estimates by 31.5 per cent, or $1 billion, to reach $4.05 billion in FY2013.\n\nRevenue from vehicle quota premiums, too, came in higher by 13.2 per cent, or $0.32 billion, to total $2.76 billion. Motor vehicle taxes grew 8.7 per cent, or $0.14 billion, to $1.69 billion.\n\nA higher-than-expected number of vehicle deregistrations (which in turn led to higher quotas of certificates of entitlement issued in FY2013), as well as more commercial vehicles being renewed helped to bolster these increases.\n\nCorporate income taxes, however, was one of the few line items which came below expectations. At $12.55 billion, corporate income taxes were 3 per cent or $0.39 billion lower than estimated, because of higher claims for capital allowances.\n\nThe revised total expenditure for FY2013 was $52.34 billion - 2 per cent less than the previous estimate of $53.41 billion - mainly due to lower spending by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Ministry of National Development (MND).\n\nAt MOT, the insolvency of one of the Downtown Line Stage 2 contractors meant delays in progress; at MND, there was lower spending for public housing upgrading programmes, due to the slow progress and deferment of some initiatives.\n\nTop-ups to endowment and trust funds were unchanged at $5.59 billion. Net investment returns contribution (NIRC) was $7.94 billion, 3 per cent or $0.24 billion higher than the $7.7 billion earlier estimated.\n\nSeparately, actual figures for FY2012 also yielded positive surprises. Operating revenue was $55.81 billion, surpassing the $55.18 billion published last year.\n\nTotal expenditure was $49 billion, below the projected $50.11 billion.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But even though this is a good start, I believe the government can still do more, as SMEs are often faced with pressure margins and rising costs,\" said Yong Yean Chau, CEO of Parkway Trust Management.\n\n\"There are good things in the Budget to push through the economic transformation. In order to gain productivity, companies will need to look at technology and automation, but there is a limit to how much of that we can do,\" added Douglas Foo, chairman of Sakae Holdings.\n\nOng Jun Quan, executive director of Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering, said that he had hoped that the Budget would provide some cash grants to SMEs to help them with their cash flow problems.\n\nGiven the Budget's emphasis on restructuring, firms said that they will leverage on the productivity measures to reduce manpower costs. \"The Productivity and Innovation Credits (PIC) scheme is a major point in the Budget, and it is beneficial to SMEs. But as costs continue to rise, we will have to do with lesser manpower and more efficiency. Through the PIC, the government is helping us to do that,\" said Arun Narula, chairman of Mercantile Pacific Asia. His company aims to be more efficient in two years' time by tapping the extended PIC scheme and introducing new technology and automation.\n\nSakae Holding's Mr Foo acknowledged that the enhancement of the Continuing Education and Training (CET) system through a $500 million increase of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund (LLEF) will help people to upgrade their skills and be more mobile. He explained that with gains in productivity, if companies needed fewer man-hours for projects, then \"they do not need full-time employees to be there all the time\". This frees up employees to work freelance or part-time for a few employers in the industry, he said. Under such a shared-labour resources model, companies can become more nimble with a leaner workforce.\n\nMr Foo noted that since there are limits to how much productivity certain sectors can gain through technology and automation alone, the Budget could have introduced measures to help companies relook their business models and address their cost problems. \"The Budget contained measures to help start-ups, but I feel that there is already enough help for start-ups out there. Instead, there should have been a focus on helping SMEs with business model innovation through grants to engage consultants, for example, so that they can review their business models to remain more competitive,\" he said.\n\nThe Budget was also concerned with improving productivity in the construction sector through raising levies for lower-skilled foreign labour, a skills upgrading scheme for these workers, the use of more productive materials and extended employment stay in Singapore for higher-skilled labourers.\n\nSoon Li Heng's Mr Ong said that these measures were designed to help construction firms reduce their reliance on manpower, particularly low-skilled foreign labour. For instance, the push for more productive materials such as prefabrication units would cut down on the amount of manpower needed.\n\nWhile he welcomed the skills upgrading scheme, Mr Ong felt that this was bitter-sweet for him. \"As for the skills upgrading course, some of my workers are really good in some skills but they are generally not good in English or languages in general. Therefore they will fall through the cracks because they may not be able to pass the course and upgrade even though they are really good in their work,\" he said.\n\nAs for the extension of period of employment for higher-skilled workers, he pointed out that this only applied to workers from non-traditional sources (NTS) and China, but the bulk of his workers came from traditional sources, particularly India. \"So for me, this measure does not change my situation. Again, they are on the same shorter work permit stays as before, unless I now go and replace them with NTS workers.\"\n\nInterestingly, the companies that BT spoke to seemed unfazed by the the increase in employer's contribution to CPF, saying that this was likely to have a minimum impact on them.\n\nSome firms welcomed the measures to boost the internationalisation of local companies. \"With the simplification of programmes such as the Market Readiness Assistance and Global Company Partnerships, SMEs are a step closer to having the support needed for their plans to succeed internationally,\" said Ingrid Sidiadinoto, managing director of UPS Singapore.\n\nMr Narula added that these measures are positive as they will help increase Singapore brands globally. \"From our perspective, we welcome these timely measures as we are preparing to expand our brand globally in the next few years.\"\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was attributed mostly to a one-time gain of $7.09 million from the disposal of a stake in a subsidiary.\n\nTing Teck Jin, executive chairman and chief executive officer, told The Business Times that this was to allow the company to focus on its core business.\n\nAdministrative expenses more than halved to $9.26 million from FY2012's $19.36 million, which included a goodwill impairment of $10.22 million for discontinued operations.\n\nFY2013 earnings per share from continuing operations came to 0.48 cent, against the previous year's loss per share of 3.48 cents.\n\nEMS said yesterday that it has entered into an agreement to lease from JTC a 23,237.88 square metre parcel of land in Tuas for 16 years and eight months, commencing May 1 this year. EMS will be constructing a new facility for its offshore and marine activities that will be five times bigger than its current premises.\n\nThe company will pay JTC annual rent and annual water frontage fees of about $360,000 and $158,000, respectively.\n\nOn completion, the facility will replace the group's current premises, which has 13 years of remaining lease. The group expects to move into its new premises by FY2015.\n\nMr Ting said: \"Upon completion of the new waterfront facility in Tuas, the group is positioned to take on much larger projects especially with the major advantage of a waterfront boundary. It will also allow us to bring various services - currently outsourced - under one roof, leading to economies of scale and lower costs.\"\n\nThe group's order book to-date stood at about $55 million, mostly for delivery over the next 12 months.\n\nOn the business outlook, EMS is seeking to secure two repeat DES contracts from Koastal and a separate DES contract from another third-party in FY2014, each estimated to be worth US$36 million.\n\nEMS expects its revenue in FY2014 to exceed that of FY2013.\n\nThe counter closed trading 0.7 cent up at 7.6 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That was down sharply from the 3.2 per cent pace reported in January and the 4.1 per cent logged in the third quarter.\n\nIt is not unusual for the government to make sharp revisions to GDP numbers, as it does not have complete data when it makes its initial estimates. In fact, the latest figures will be subject to revisions next month as more information is received.\n\nThe revision left GDP just above the economy's potential growth trend, which analysts put somewhere between a 2 per cent and 2.3 per cent pace.\n\nConsumer spending accounted for a large chunk of the revision after retail sales in November and December came in weaker than assumed.\n\nConsumer spending was cut to a 2.6 per cent rate, still the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2012. It had previously been reported to have grown at a 3.3 per cent pace.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, contributed 1.73 percentage points to GDP growth, down from the previously reported 2.26 percentage points. As a result, final domestic demand was lowered two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2 per cent rate.\n\nThe loss of momentum appears to have spilled over into the first quarter of 2014, with an unusually cold winter weighing on retail sales, home building and sales, hiring and industrial production.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which has been cutting back on the amount of money it injects into the economy through monthly bond purchases, views the recent soft patch as temporary.\n\nFed chairman Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Thursday that the cold weather had played a role in the weakening data. She said, however, that it would take a \"significant change\" to the economy's prospects for the Fed to suspend its plans to wind down its bond buying.\n\nDespite the first quarter's weak start, economists remain optimistic that growth this year will be the strongest since the recession ended almost five years ago. For all of 2013, the economy grew 1.9 per cent.\n\nTrade also weighed on fourth-quarter revisions, after a fall in exports in December resulted in a bigger trade deficit in the fourth quarter than the government had initially assumed.\n\nTrade's contribution to growth was lowered to 0.99 percentage point from 1.33 percentage points. It was still the largest contribution to GDP growth since late 2010.\n\nInventories, previously reported to have risen by US$127.2 billion in the fourth quarter, were revised down to US$117.4 billion. The rise in the stocks of unsold goods was still the largest since early 1998 and followed a gain of US$115.7 billion in the third quarter of 2013.\n\nThe contribution to growth from inventories, which the government put at 0.42 percentage point a month ago, was revised down to only 0.14 percentage point. Excluding inventories, the economy grew at a 2.3 per cent rate, revised down from a 2.5 per cent pace.

Seen as gold's \"new rival\", the Bitcoin mining process mirrors that of gold mining.\n\nIntroduced in January 2009 by its developer Satoshi Nakamoto, the deregulated cryptocurrency has quickly caught the attention of entrepreneurs, investors, politicians and regulators. However, the wide fluctuations in Bitcoin's market value overshadow its protocol, which includes its mining component.\n\nBitcoin mining aims to prevent fraud and double-spending by verifying transactions between Bitcoin wallets, as well as introduce more people into the system when miners are rewarded with Bitcoins.\n\nAt first glance, Bitcoin mining seems to be easy money: The necessary software and hardware are easy enough to obtain and with quick installation, miners can start profiting from mining.\n\nThat said, Bitcoin mining consumes a good amount of energy and is unconducive to countries with high electrical costs such as Singapore. Also, as good mining hardware with high raw speed performance is highly sought after, they must often be pre-ordered months in advance and can easily cost a few thousand dollars. Those available second hand are usually older-generation models with lower processing power, and are uncompetitive in the crowded mining space.\n\nTo profit from Bitcoins, miners must ensure that the total value of Bitcoins mined is higher than the total cost incurred from mining activities. Costs include the purchase of mining hardware, energy costs incurred from mining and the market value of Bitcoins (characterised by high fluctuations).\n\nToday, there are about 12 million Bitcoins in circulation. With its total supply capped at 21 million, the system designed by Mr Nakamoto automatically adjusts to the difficulty of mining for Bitcoins, depending on how fast its algorithms are being solved.\n\nThis means that as Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly popular, it gets harder and harder to solve the algorithms and be rewarded with Bitcoins to ensure that the cryptocurrency is \"unearthed\" at a sustainable rate.\n\nThe remaining unmined currencies are released at a slower pace. And every few years, the creation rate of Bitcoins is halved and profitability squeezed further. It is not uncommon for miners to go into the red, as Singapore players are learning the hard way.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On any given weekend, the multiplexes sell out sessions hours ahead in advance, and an increasing number of cinema operators not only run midnight screenings on weekdays but even go to the extent of operating 24 hours on weekends to cope with the demand.\n\nCinephiles who want to go beyond mainstream releases are also getting their fix outside the multiplex with various independent outfits organising their own film events. These range from regular screenings at smaller venues in museums to larger outdoor festivals.\n\nFort Canning, which has hosted numerous \"live\" concerts, was transformed into an open air cinema last year for Films at the Fort. All 6,000 tickets for the four-day event were completely sold out, and it will be expanded to 10 days this year to feature a wider variety of films.\n\nPerfect weather\n\nBen Williams of Groundswell Events, the Films at the Fort organiser, says that the concept of open-air cinemas is popular in Europe, North America and Australia. In major cities such as Paris, New York and Sydney, it often heralds the arrival of summer.\n\nBarring rain, our tropical climate makes it suitable for holding such events all year round. \"Singapore has pleasant balmy evenings that are perfect for the outdoor cinema experience,\" says Mr Williams. \"(Open air cinemas) are a great place to relax with friends, watch a film under the stars and enjoy being in the outdoors.\"\n\nMovie fans do not even need to wait till August for the next Films at the Fort because a new outdoor film event will be held at the same venue next month.\n\nBilling itself as Singapore's first on-screen music festival, Encore will feature three nights of screenings plus themed after-parties with a \"live\" DJ that will kick off after the final credits roll.\n\n\"This is a new brand of movie festival for Singapore's entertainment scene,\" says Adela Teo of Sirens Network, the organisers of Encore. The 17-year-old company is a specialist in open-air cinema events, and incidentally handled the audio-visual equipment for Films at the Fort. It prides itself on challenging the conventional movie-going experience, and so far has organised screenings everywhere from beaches to rooftops.\n\nDifferent movie-going experience\n\nFestivals like Encore and Films at the Fort's aim is to provide movie-goers with a totally different experience from what they get at a multiplex. For instance, both offer gourmet food and drinks which one will not find at a typical cinema concession stand.\n\nThe beverage selection at Films at the Fort last year included Australian and New Zealand wines, French champagnes, boutique beers and ciders; while food came from Deliciae Hospitality Management, the owner of restaurants such as L'Entrecote and Sabio. This year, festival goers can pre-order picnic hampers if they want to skip the F&B queue. Encore has roped in a sponsor, Kronenbourg 1664, to run a full bar and will offer free-flow popcorn alongside a selection of other food and beverages.\n\nLike the after-party segment that Encore has added on, Films at the Fort also went beyond just screening the main feature every night - it added one short film by an emerging Singaporean filmmaker every evening in a show of support for the local arts scene. \"A short film about karung guni was a real hit with the audience,\" remarks Mr Williams.\n\nSouping up the classics\n\nWhile the line-up for these festivals usually feature titles that have already been cinematically released and are available to rent or buy on DVDs, Ms Teo feels confident of drawing a crowd because the three movies that Encore is running - The Beatles' 1964 black-and-white comedy A Hard Day's Night; John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John's 1978 high school musical Grease; and the 2008 big-screen adaptation of the ABBA juke-box West End hit Mamma Mia! - are \"timeless classics\".\n\n\"Even if you have seen them on your TV or cinema, the outdoor big screen is still a very much more organic and interactive experience compared to the solitary nature of watching a movie in a cinema,\" she says. \"Movies like A Hard Day's Night and Grease really have to be seen on the largest screen and in immersive surround-sound to really feel their impact.\"\n\nNot only that, Ms Teo adds that the older titles have been souped up from their original 35mm prints and mono sound to the latest 4k resolution and 5.1 digital sound. \"The experience of watching these classics on the big screen should be as good, if not better than when they were on screens the first time round,\" she notes.\n\nFilms at the Fort's Mr Williams adds that when the Tom Cruise fighter-pilot classic Top Gun was screened last year, the audio set-up made it feel like planes were flying over the audience's heads.\n\nDriven by passion\n\nWhile Encore and Films at the Fort are ticketed events, SCUM (Society for Cult & Underground Movies) is a local collective of three working professionals who share their passion for alternative cinema by running free screenings of anything from old school gongfu flicks to blaxploitation, anime and long-lost creature features.\n\nFormed in early 2007, it started as a one-man operation before manpower constraints took its toll and SCUM Cinema was suspended indefinitely, according to Herman Ho, who runs his own creative agency and is one-third of the collective.\n\nBut driven by their love of movies, SCUM decided to make a comeback last year with a new blog and a double bill of Shaw Brothers gongfu films held at its new home at The Arts House.\n\n\"Moving forward, we are aiming to hold a screening bi-monthly,\" says Mr Ho. \"Our goal is to have a SCUM Film Festival in the near future which we can tour around the region, and who knows, maybe even around the world . . . We are also hoping to work directly with more film distributors and directors to expand our repertoire of films.\"\n\nAs a fully independent outfit, SCUM still faces many challenges: On top of dedicating time and effort to maintaining the website, its Facebook page and organising screenings, the trio also have their own careers to juggle.\n\nIn addition, operational and licensing costs come directly out of their own pockets. To defray that, original limited edition prints and merchandise - produced specifically for each screening - are on sale at the venue.\n\nMr Ho adds that \"sheer passion\" is what drives SCUM on, and the memory of Singaporeans filling out venues where alternative titles were being screened at the Singapore International Film Festival during the 90s remains an inspiration for them to pursue this cause.\n\n\"Honestly, we hope to keep this going for as long as possible, and we strongly feel there is a market out there for such films,\" he says. \"With all the cineplexes offering more or less the same Hollywood blockbusters, we believe that smaller film societies like SCUM Cinema can fill the gap to provide more film choices (for local cinema-goers).\"\n\nOr as Encore's Ms Teo simply sums it up: \"We're just movie lovers who want to watch our favourite movies on the big screens the way we watched it when we were kids!\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Most employers were spared the pain of further levy hikes or quota cuts, though Mr Tharman did slap a $100 levy hike on the construction sector, which has been a laggard in productivity growth.\n\nReiterating that \"raising productivity is at the centre of our economic agenda\" because it is the only way to raise living standards in coming years, Mr Tharman also extended the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme - meant to lapse in YA2015 - by another three years.\n\nThis was something all the major business groups had asked for.\n\nWhile SMEs did not get the higher cash payout many had hoped for, the government did come up with PIC+ to help smaller enterprises make large investments to transform. PIC+ pushes up the expenditure cap for each qualifying activity by 50 per cent - so that SMEs can claim tax deductions of up to $1.8 million over three years, compared to $1.2 million before.\n\nTogether, the government's productivity support schemes will pump more funds back to businesses than the additional foreign worker levies collected in recent years, Mr Tharman said.\n\n\"However, we are not recycling monies indiscriminately, or seeking to benefit all firms equally. Our schemes will still favour the more dynamic and efficient players,\" he added.\n\nIncentives were also sharpened to \"enable innovation to pervade the economy\", he said. These include ones to encourage investment in innovation and skills, support the piloting and scaling up of infocomm technologies, catalyse financing for companies at various growth stages and help firms go abroad.\n\nThe one piece of news that dismayed some businesses was that employer CPF contribution rates will be hiked from January 2015.\n\n\"Increases in employers' CPF contributions will not help and will impact small businesses as they employ more older workers, proportionately,\" said SBF CEO Mr Ho.\n\nBut the Singapore National Employers' Federation sought comfort in the $360 million that the government has set aside for one-year employment credits to help employers adjust, as well as the government's assurance that it would not raise the rate beyond 17 per cent any time soon.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah said it can be viewed as an attempt to raise productivity - higher CPF contribution rates are more positive than raising foreign worker levies. \"The hikes in employers' CPF rate will benefit Singaporeans directly, whereas, previously the hikes in foreign workers' levy benefited only the official coffers,\" he said.\n\nBut funds and measures can only do so much in service of what is a \"major, multi-year undertaking\". Mr Tharman said: \"Transforming our economy is not just about technology and productivity is not ultimately about the dollars and cents of upgrading. It also means changing our social norms.\"\n\nIn his view, this ranges from creating a workplace culture that values employees' views, to a culture of job mastery, to changes in consumer habits - becoming at ease with self-service technologies, for instance. In fact, Mr Tharman's 90-minute speech outlined how the government, too, has changed its thinking.\n\nAs a country, Singapore has entered into a new phase: incomes are rising less quickly, the disparities between different groups are becoming more of a concern, and the population is ageing rapidly, often with fewer children to support older Singaporeans, he said.\n\n\"Our thinking has shifted in this new phase, and our initiatives are helping to level up our society and mitigate inequalities.\" Hence the raft of measures unveiled on the social front: higher healthcare subsidies, more assistance with pre-school fees for more families, higher bursaries for students in tertiary institutes and higher subsidies for children with special needs.\n\nIn addition, the government has set aside $360 million for utilities, rebates on Service and Conservancy Charges and cash grants (GST Voucher) to help older Singaporeans and lower and middle-income families hit by Singapore's rising cost of living.\n\nHowever, as Singapore strengthens its social support and safety nets, the \"whole approach must encourage a compact between personal and collective responsibility\", Mr Tharman said.\n\n\"What is critical is not just how much we spend and redistribute resources, but how we do so. Our approach to uplifting the poor and levelling up society can only succeed if it supports a culture of personal responsibility - the desire to learn a new skill and work for a better living, and to make the effort to look after our own families. We know this from the evidence of half a century of major social interventions around the world, such as in the US and the European countries.\"\n\nIncluding the hefty $8 billion set aside for the Pioneer Generation Fund, and factoring in a contribution from net investment returns on past reserves of $8.1 billion, the government is expecting an overall deficit of $1.2 billion, or 0.3 per cent of GDP. But the deficit - which if it materialises will be the first since the global financial crisis in 2009 - will not draw on past reserves, as there are sufficient surpluses from the last few years to balance this over the current electoral term.\n\n\"The relative absence of bad news and willingness to run a deficit invite speculation of early elections in 2015, with the bitter pill of higher taxes only likely thereafter,\" said Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This sum goes into two funds: the SME Co-Investment Fund II that makes direct equity investments, and the SME Mezzanine Growth Fund, a hybrid of debt and equity.\n\nFinance minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday said: \"(The Mezzanine Growth Fund) provides a more flexible financing option for SMEs that do not wish to dilute their equity, but face challenges in increasing their borrowings from traditional banking sources.\"\n\nIn another initiative, the Micro-Loan Programme, Spring Singapore will raise the government's share of risk on micro-loans to young SMEs - firms registered for fewer than three years - from 50 per cent to 70 per cent, in order to spur lending. This is expected to catalyse an additional $32 million in loans over FY2014 and FY2015.\n\nDBS Bank, which increased its number of micro-loans made to SMEs by a quarter last year, yesterday applauded this move and pledged to step up lending to these SMEs.\n\nThe bank's head of SME Banking, Lim Chu Chong, said: \"We encourage the government to also look at increasing the loan quantum and tenure and relaxing the employee cap, which will further help banks to lend to small and young companies.\"\n\nMicro-loan quantums are now capped at $100,000, and loan tenures, at four years. Firms need to have no more than 10 employees or no more than $1 million in annual sales to be eligible for such loans.\n\nThe government also announced that it will begin studying the potential for equity crowdfunding. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and Spring Singapore are looking into an appropriate regulatory framework for such new business models, Mr Tharman said.\n\nAndrew Tinney, a partner in Financial Services for KPMG Singapore, said: \"Crowd funding is an exciting innovation and will help smaller firms raise capital at a time when banks are capital-constrained. However, it must have appropriate safeguards for investors.\"\n\nIt was also announced yesterday that IE Singapore's Global Company Partnership programme will be beefed up on the market access and manpower-development fronts.\n\nFor market access, the support level for pilot and test-bedding projects will go up from 50 per cent to 70 per cent for two years; for manpower development, support for staff attachments in overseas markets will also be expanded to cover the acquisition of new business or technical capabilities.\n\nFirms looking to expand overseas by buying fixed assets or by investing in secured overseas projects will be able to draw on a higher maximum-loan quantum under the Internationalisation Finance Scheme. Doubled from $15 million to $30 million for two years, the higher ceiling is expected to trigger up to $500 million in loans in that timeframe.\n\nThese moves are expected to benefit some 200 firms over the next two years.\n\nTan Bin Eng, a partner in Business Incentives Advisory for Ernst & Young Solutions LLP, said that going forward, execution will be key: \"These measures will be specific to each SME in terms of their needs and will require a lot more customisation. While I think the increase in support levels is great, it is even more important to find the right parties that need help.\"\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nMeasures to boost SME growth:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But All is Lost also proves sometimes less can be more.\n\nRating: B+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/budget-must-focus-business-and-society", "site_title": "Budget must focus on business and society", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBudget must focus on business and society\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTODAY, much of the business community's attention will be focused on the Budget for FY2014/15, which is to be unveiled in Parliament by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Business leaders and tax experts have submitted their wish lists, but Mr Tharman will have to balance their concerns against the economic and social needs of Singaporeans at large and the economy as a whole. And there are some key themes that merit special attention.\n\nOne of the highlights of the last three Budgets was tighter policies on foreign workers, including through gradual increases in worker levies and more stringent criteria for the granting of employment passes. Companies are still having a tough time adjusting to these changes. Many, especially multinationals, have also called for more certainty in labour policy, rather than constant adjustments. Thus, business is crossing its fingers that at least there will be no new tightening.\n\nPart of the reason for tighter regulation of foreign workers was to boost productivity. But this remains a challenge and will be a long-haul battle, for which supportive policies will need to remain in place for a number of years. Thus, there is widespread support for extending the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme (which is due to expire in the current financial year). While the scheme is reported to have a decent adoption rate of around 70 per cent, there are ways to make it still more attractive. One is to extend for a longer period the 400 per cent deduction for qualifying R&D activities and to raise the expenditure cap of $400,000 per year. The scheme could also be made more flexible for SMEs by removing expenditure caps on the six individual qualifying activities against which they can claim credits. Expanding the number of activities to include other forms of innovation would also bring more companies - especially smaller SMEs - into the PIC net.\n\nTo ease business costs, a number of tax incentives can be fine-tuned, for instance by enhancing tax deductions for a number of qualifying activities that are already in place plus introducing reliefs for some new activities such as home offices and e-commerce, which are both cost-savers. There is also a case to incentivise activities that serve social needs, such as healthcare and eldercare - which need to grow with the help of the private sector and have not enjoyed incentives thus far.\n\nOn property, the big question is whether this Budget will roll back some of the many cooling measures that are in place. While this is controversial, a case can be made to at least start the process, given that monetary policy (while still lax) will get progressively tighter and property values, and transactions, are already falling.\n\nFinally and by no means least, the government must continue to focus on issues of social equity. Raising direct taxes can be problematic and compromise Singapore's tax competitiveness. The key to improving social equity will thus lie in boosting health and education subsidies and continuing to provide targeted income support programmes. In sum, the Budget will hopefully be both business-friendly and socially progressive.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The reality is that volume has been poor for several months now, dealers spend a large portion of each day either trading on their own or playing computer games and penny stock turnover has been declining.\n\nIn yesterday's session when the STI added 13.29 points, volume was two billion units worth $1.1 billion, of which $640 million or 58 per cent was done in the 30 index stocks.\n\nUnderpinning the index's recovery over the past fortnight is a rebound on Wall Street, a bounce that has come despite weak employment and housing numbers and has probably been driven by a belief that interest rates will remain depressed for at least another a year.\n\nAlthough trading conditions in Singapore are dire, investors might draw some consolation from the STI's performance. Since dropping to a 2014 low of 2,960 on Feb 5, the index has now risen 139 points or 4.7 per cent in 12 trading sessions, though it still is 68 points down for the year.\n\nApart from the banks and Jardine group which regularly play central roles in moving the index, a notable contribution this week came from Olam International, which gained 19 cents or 12 per cent over the week to $1.765.\n\nIn the penny segment, a popular theme has been China water treatment, a play which has brought HanKore, Memstar and various other low-priced water treatment counters into play. In HanKore's case, the stock is rated a \"buy\". However, the water treatment sector's leader, Hyflux, came under pressure after it reported a 28 per cent drop in net profit to $44 million for the year ended Dec 31, 2013.\n\nIn its \"sell\" on Hyflux, OCBC Investment Research described the results as \"very disappointing\" as core earnings were 15 per cent below forecast.\n\n\"Going forward, Hyflux also warns of a slower first half in 2014, citing the timing of its projects. Nevertheless, management remains upbeat about its prospects over the next 12 months, where it sees significant opportunities in its key markets with an estimated US$8 billion worth of projects made available for tender,\" said the broker.\n\n\"But we believe that investors may want to switch out of Hyflux first, hence we downgrade our rating from 'hold' to 'sell'. Our fair value also drops from $1.23 to 84 cents.\"\n\nHyflux's shares yesterday lost 4.5 cents to $1.195 with 2.5 million units traded.\n\nHanKore, in the meantime, was rated a \"buy\" by OSK DMG. The broker said that HanKore chairman David Chen and chief financial officer Felix Yau participated in OSK DMG's Feb 19 non-deal roadshow (NDR) in Singapore.\n\n\"Hankore's strong points include further progress in its merger with China Everbright International (CEI), potentially lower financing costs and solid asset quality . . . We believe that as HanKore draws closer to completing its merger with CEI, its valuations will re-rate. This process is already under way. At the current price of 12.3 cents, the stock is trading at a 19x FY15 P/E (incorporating CEI's asset injection), compared with the peer average of 30x. Maintain 'buy', with our 16.1 cents target based on a 25x FY15 P/E.\"\n\nIn its Q1 Asia Outlook yesterday, JP Morgan presented one top buy and one top sell idea from each country. For Singapore, it said that there was a clear change in leadership away from domestic demand towards external factors for the first time since 2010.\n\n\"Shorter term, the market is beginning to bounce off of oversold levels and shorting activity for the market is close to all-time high reported levels . . . we would be selectively adding exposure to the Singapore market in areas with very heavy outstanding short activity that are very oversold. These include banks, industrials and telcos.\" JPM's top buy is Singapore Airlines and top sell is Far East Hospitality Trust.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those who like a bit of heritage with their travels, may want to head back in time at these properties.\n\nThe Brown Palace\n\n321 17th Street Denver Colorado 80202\n\nwww.brownpalace.com\n\nSOME hotels lose their shine and look their age after a few decades of operations, but not the Brown Palace Hotel & Spa. Much of Denver has changed since the hotel's opening in August 1892, but The Brown Palace still retains its grandeur and grace.\n\nThe 241-room hotel is named after Henry C Brown, a real estate entrepreneur who came to Denver from Ohio.\n\nBack in the late 1800s, people from all across the United States were still flocking to the West, seeking their fortunes in gold and silver. Brown saw the opportunity to build a hotel in Denver: people would always stop in the city, regardless of whether they were settling down or passing through, and they would need a place to stay.\n\nBrown spared no expense building his hotel, spending US$2 million, a huge sum back then. It was designed in the Italian Renaissance style, using Colorado red granite and Arizona sandstone for the building's exterior.\n\nInside, there is an atrium lobby with balconies rising eight floors above ground, surrounded by cast iron railings with ornate grilles. Onyx was imported from Mexico for parts of the hotel, no wood was used for the floors and walls, and the hotel was hailed as the second fire-proof building in the United States.\n\nThe hotel's original artesian well still exists. Located 720 feet underground, it continues to provide water to every faucet in the hotel.\n\nSince 1905, nearly every US president has visited the hotel. While on their tour of the US in 1964, the Beatles stayed here too.\n\nAccording to hotel trivia, the Brown Palace saw a great surge in applications for housekeeping by young girls. One of its four suites is named after the band. The interiors of The Beatles Suite may not be overly posh, but there are hints of the Beatles presence including a jukebox in the living room, and Beatles memorabilia on the walls. It comes as no surprise to hear that the hotel has some special guests from days of long ago. Each October, the hotel's historian leads guests on tours through some of the hotel's more hair-raising hauntings.\n\nThe Broadmoor\n\n1 Lake Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO 80906\n\nwww.broadmoor.com\n\nTHERE are plenty of stories of people who made it big in the midwest in the late 1800s and early 1900s and one of them is Spencer Penrose, a Philadelphia entrepreneur who had made his fortune in gold and copper mining.\n\nPenrose had earlier bought The Broadmoor Casino and Hotel, and had ambitious plans for it. With the objective of creating the most beautiful resort in the world, he imported artisans from Italy and other European countries to create the ornate mouldings and paintings which adorn the interior of The Broadmoor as well as the elaborate exterior detailing.\n\nStepping into The Broadmoor is much like going to a resort in Tuscany, back then something that was seen in the US, but today, is still just as impressive.\n\nThe hotel's architectural and design features include a spectacular curved marble staircase, dramatic chandeliers, Della Robbia-styled tiles, handpainted beams and ceilings, a carved marble fountain, and a striking pink stucco facade.\n\nBesides US presidents, the hotel has also played host to numerous entertainment and sports personalities. In keeping with the times, amenities have been added on to the hotel, including a spa, golf course and convention facilities. Guests can choose to stay at one of its 756 guest rooms, 124 suites, 44 cottage bedrooms, or two brownstone apartments.\n\nBack in its early days, The Broadmoor was known as the \"European alternative\", and many visitors came for the clean, mountain air, said to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis and other bronchial maladies.\n\nThese days however, no one would bat an eyelid, if you choose not to stay at the hotel, but to have Sunday brunch at its Lake Terrace dining room. The old-fashioned buttermilk griddle cakes with melted butter and Vermont maple syrup are worth the ride there.\n\nThe Mining Exchange\n\n8 S Nevada Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO 80903\n\nwww.wyndham.com\n\nIT is not difficult to guess what this hotel building was used for previously. The Mining Exchange, was once home to the Colorado Springs Mining Exchange to promote regional mining companies and their stock, in the 1920s. According to archives, the Exchange trading room was two storeys high, with a brass railing that separated the public area from the trading floor.\n\nBut as mining ebbed in importance to the region, the building opened to other businesses including law, architectural and oil companies.\n\nThree years ago, American businessman Perry Sanders bought over the building, got rid of tenants, gutted the building to its core and restored it to its original grandeur. In 2012, The Mining Exchange opened, under the Wyndham Group.\n\nThe old trading room still exists, but part of it has been converted to form ballroom space. The Exchange's main vault still stands in the hotel lobby, becoming a photo spot for hotel guests.\n\nSmaller vaults are on the remaining floors, and they no longer keep money, but have been converted into storage space for the hotel's housekeeping department.\n\nOld\n\nbrick walls, much of them original, can still be seen in the hotel's 117 rooms.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 2013 film Captain Phillips is based on the incident.\n\nMaersk gave no details about how the two men had died. \"The cause of the death for both men is part of the ongoing investigation, but it was not related to vessel operations or their duties as security personnel,\" its statement said.\n\nLocal law enforcement agencies are investigating the deaths on the Maersk Alabama, which berthed in Port of Victoria around midday on Feb 17. The security contractors had boarded the vessel on Jan 29, Maersk said.\n\nMaersk Alabama is part of a US-flagged fleet controlled by Maersk Line Limited, a unit in AP Moller-Maersk, which performs military, government and humanitarian missions by transporting cargo on its container, tanker and multi-purpose ships, according to the company's website.\n\nMaersk's statement said Maersk Line Limited contracts vessel security services to Trident Group in accordance with US Coast Guard security directives.\n\nContracted security is part of anti-piracy protection plans to safeguard crews and vessels.\n\nIt said the Maersk Alabama is persistently in high-risk areas since it provides feeder service - calling at smaller ports to collect containers that are later loaded on bigger container vessels - to the east coast of Africa.\n\nCaptain Phillips, directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi, is based on the attack on the ship in 2009, when Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage by pirates led by Abduwali Muse in the Indian Ocean. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

We're talking mob scenes, panting female fans (channelling their inner teeny-bopper) and an Armani-suited approach to showbiz that resembles the old-school sophistication of the Rat Pack days.\n\nGranted, Marin and fellow Il Divo mates Urs Buhler, David Miller and Sebastien Izambard project a squeaky-clean image that the likes of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr could never be accused of. For the past decade, they have also been part of a polished stage act that is the elegant equivalent of, say, a PG-rated romance. It's a formulaic act that has its fair share of detractors, but you can't argue with mega-success: with a string of hit albums and sellout world tours to its credit, the group has been one of entertainment mogul Simon Cowell's biggest creations.\n\nEach of Il Divo's members has a distinct vocal persona - the opera-trained Marin possesses a powerful baritone that in pop-music terms might be compared to Tom Jones (a personal favourite of Marin's). The resulting blend has been described by critics as \"a huge explosion of vocals\" and a \"musical aphrodisiac\" that leaves audiences swooning.\n\nWith dark eyes, a hairstyle with a signature curl and smouldering good looks, the Germany-born, Madrid-raised Marin, 45, plays his Latin lover role to perfection. True to form, he proudly proclaims that he loves women.\n\n\"I'm an old-fashioned romantic,\" he says over the phone from a London hotel room, just before embarking on the Asian leg of a tour that starts in Seoul tomorrow. \"There's nothing more beautiful than to be with the woman you love, bring her flowers, go to a candlelit dinner and walk under the stars.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Young people are missing that. In clubs these days, you can't talk to women and say the things you need to.\"\n\nMarin, who is currently single (the only member of the group with that status), says he has \"many girlfriends - not just one. I love to flirt, even when I'm in a relationship. I love to go places and 'go fishing' - I'm a gentleman, of course, but now I'm only faithful to myself.\"\n\nIt's tough being popular and even harder to sing each hit song like it's the first time, but then the level of fan appreciation helps. Marin reveals that female audience members present him with impromptu gifts every night - typically underwear wrapped around their phone numbers, he says in a matter-of-fact manner. Tom Jones would approve.\n\nThere is an easy on-stage camaraderie among the singers and - backed by a full orchestra and supported at times by guest artistes - an Il Divo concert may be predictable but rarely dull.\n\n\"I've been singing on stage for 37 years and the thing with Il Divo is that there are still many things to achieve,\" says Marin, who was known as \"The Little Caruso\" when young. \"Our life has been like a movie - singing with Celine (Dion), Barbra (Streisand), Toni (Braxton) - but we're always trying to do something new to keep the audiences and fans awake.\"\n\nHe adds: \"There is a huge age range among our fans - from seven to 105 - and the good thing is our style of song (the pop style of music with a slow build-up to an operatic climax) has wide appeal. There is an understanding among the four of us and we have a unique sound. We have many imitators; they do okay but they don't reach the excitement level that we reach.\"\n\nThe success of Il Divo means the group is constantly on the go, with tour dates, special appearances and multiple sponsorship obligations. A new album is also due in the coming year. They managed to play Broadway for the first time late last year, and elements from that show, A Musical Affair, have been incorporated into the current tour - the Singapore audience at their show next month can expect to be entertained by a repertoire of classic Broadway standards and more recent musical theatre hits.\n\nAway from the madness, Marin says he enjoys being a music producer - he still works with ex-wife Geraldine Larrosa (stage name Innocence) - and will likely continue producing music for her and others when his singing career comes to an end.\n\nHis earlier career also spanned the world of opera but Marin says whereas an opera singer has to play a role, in pop music and musical theatre there is the opportunity to be more intimate with the audience. \"With opera you have to act but you cannot really whisper something beautiful,\" he says. \"I miss the opera, but I miss music more.\"\n\nMarin allows that being in Il Divo is \"a bit stressful. It's going to reach a point where we have a break, but it's beautiful to be in the group and also do solo stuff - I don't see ourselves not doing music.\" He adds: \"It's going to be finished when Il Divo says it's finished or the audience says it's finished.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the music plays on and the boys in the band keep on singing. Two years ago, Marin moved to Paraguay, where the weather is more agreeable and where the US is easily accessible. Most of his time, however, is spent in hotels and on the road. Marin says it's been a great ride so far and there's still a long way to go. \"I'm a man that never regrets anything,\" he says.\n\n'Il Divo: A Musical Affair' is on March 17 at 8.30pm at The Star Theatre at the Star Performing Arts Centre.

The preceding year recorded a forex loss of $1.5 million.\n\nRivalea also experienced margins squeeze from weaker-than-expected selling prices in the earlier part of 2013. Higher costs of animal feed and grain at Rivalea and increased ingredient costs at QAF's bakery operations mainly contributed to the 7 per cent rise in total costs of materials for the group at $558.5 million.\n\nProfit before tax for the year fell by $6.2 million to $42.05 million as a result.\n\nBut QAF said that selling prices at Rivalea showed \"encouraging signs of improvement\" in late 2013.\n\n\"The group's bakery operations maintained its level of profitability despite facing higher ingredient and raw material costs in FY2013 as compared to FY2012,\" QAF said in its financial statement yesterday.\n\nQAF said it is expecting less volatility in raw material and other operating costs for this financial year and expects to achieve \"an encouraging level of profitability in FY 2014\".\n\nThe group has proposed a final dividend of 4 cents per share, unchanged from a year ago.\n\nShares of QAF yesterday closed 0.5 cent higher at 82.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many SMEs continue to be hard-hit by high business costs and tight labour quotas.\n\nAgainst this background, there are more measures in Budget 2014 to help businesses - especially SMEs and micro SMEs - to stay on course.\n\nThe Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme - one of the key incentives to promote productivity - is due to end in 2015. Following calls from businesses, the PIC scheme will continue until Year of Assessment (YA) 2018.\n\nThere will also be a new PIC+ scheme for SMEs effective from the YA2015, increasing the spending cap for SMEs to $600,000 per year from YA2015 to 2018.\n\nThe IRAS will be announcing further details of the PIC+ scheme in March 2014 and it is hoped that the new scheme will simplify the criteria for SMEs.\n\nThere are also enhancements to various other existing tax incentives to boost productivity and innovation. To promote innovation through R&D, Singapore will extend a 50 per cent enhanced tax deduction for qualifying R&D spending until YA2025. This will help businesses to better plan and commit to R&D programmes which will take time to conceptualise, develop, test and commercialise into innovative products or processes.\n\nThe writing down allowances for capital expenditure incurred on Intellectual Property Rights, due to expire in YA2015, will continue for another five years until YA2020. Likewise, the Land Intensification Allowance will be extended until June 30, 2020, to maximise land use, and will be extended to the logistics sector which appears to be a key growth sector due to the increasing flow of goods via e-commerce.\n\nOne change that went against the overall theme of helping business is the proposed increase in employer's CPF contribution rate from Jan 1, 2015. Although the increase is only one percentage point, this was not widely expected. However, a Temporary Employment Credit (TEC), which will partly offset the increases in CPF contributions rates for one year, will help cushion the impact.\n\nManaging healthcare costs for older Singaporeans\n\nSingapore has one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world and maintaining this success is no mean feat. With a fast aging population and rising healthcare costs, the elderly are at risk of being left out.\n\nDuring the 2014 Budget, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam announced that Singapore would set aside an $8 billion fund to support the Pioneer Generation. Under the package, more than 450,000 older Singaporeans can get help to pay for their MediShield Life premiums. They can also expect subsidies for outpatient treatment and more top-ups into Medisave accounts.\n\nWhile the focus was on the Pioneer Generation, other groups were not left out. Other than the increase in CPF contributions, Singaporeans aged 55 and above and not in the Pioneer Generation group would be entitled to receive a Medisave top-up of $100-$200 annually for the next five years.\n\nNarrowing the income gap\n\nSingapore's income gap, measured by the Gini coefficient, is higher than many developed countries.\n\nBudget 2013 introduced various measures to help narrow the income gap with measures such as the Wage Credit Scheme put in place to help lower-income groups. Indeed, in Budget 2014, Mr Tharman noted that Singapore's Gini coefficient was lower in 2013 than it has been in over a decade.\n\nContinuing in the same vein, Budget 2014 offers more support to the lower-income groups and elderly to help ease the cost of living. This will include a variety of subsidies for medical, education and transport costs. There will be a one-off GST Seniors' Bonus of up to $250 for Singaporeans aged 55 and above in 2014. There will also be an increase in parent reliefs and personal tax reliefs for those with handicapped dependents.\n\nThere have been calls over the weeks leading to Budget 2014 to increase the marginal personal tax rates and/or introduce further measures to tax the wealthy, but this did not happen. Obviously, the better-than-expected surplus has helped and there is no need for the government to turn to these measures. We should, however, be seeing a tighter Budget position in years to come and it may be a matter of time before additional tax revenue sources may be required.\n\nConclusion Singapore is currently at an inflection point. Overall, the measures are in line with our expectations. Moving to 2014, we need to continue with the restructuring process to ensure that Singapore's economy remains competitive and vibrant. As Mr Tharman said: \"It is a major, multi-year undertaking\" for Singapore, but by undertaking this, there can be better jobs for Singaporeans and a brighter future for all.\n\nLow Hwee Chua is head of tax services and Yap Hsien Yew is senior manager at Deloitte Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Feb 11 this year, the group increased its shareholding in WBL to 67 per cent following the close of its exit offers to acquire all the stock units and outstanding convertible bonds of WBL.\n\nIts other segments also posted increases in revenue. Engineering and construction saw revenue increase marginally to $455.7 million in 2013 from $452.8 million. Revenue from property rental and services increased 14 per cent to $205.7 million. Revenue from property development was $39.9 million compared with $150,000 previously.\n\nNotably, other income increased to $184.8 million from $21.3 million due mainly to the divestment gain of about $115.9 million from the sale of UE Bizhub East, the deemed disposal gain of about $21.4 million from available-for-sale financial assets previously held directly and indirectly through associated company UE group, and a gain of about $12.3 million from the disposal of available-for-sale financial assets held by WBL Group.\n\nEarnings per share were 24.5 cents versus 20 cents (restated) previously. As at Dec 31, the group had cash and cash equivalents of $889 million, of which $291 million was contributed by WBL Group.\n\nA first and final dividend of five cents per ordinary stock, a special dividend of two cents per ordinary stock, and a preference dividend of 7.5 per cents per preference share have been proposed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Written as an absurdist piece of theatre influenced by Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett, Marco Polo is about two blind friends who meet up after death, and try to figure out if they ended up in heaven or hell. Amid the uncertainty, they begin to understand what it is to be lonesome, fearful and utterly lost, and try to recapture emotions they had when they were alive.\n\nThe Raffles Institution student had only written one play for school before, and likes writing poetry in his spare time. He adds: \"The plays that strike a chord with me are Singapore plays, that tell the Singapore story.\"\n\nHis play will be directed by veteran independent director Sean Tobin and performed by Bright Ong and Ebi Shankara. This is the first time that Tobin is working with TheatreWorks' 24-hour Playwriting Competition winners but says that it's the absurdist tone of the play that drew him in. \"I liked the idea, and found it challenging and imaginative,\" he shares. \"I was quite amazed that it was so polished and tight, as a first script.\"\n\nTan didn't have to finetune the play, although if he could, he says he would have made the language more precise and impactful and given the two characters more personality.\n\nThe challenge is presenting an absurdist play without dumbing it down, adds Tobin, but thinks there's a lot of scope to create that \"after world\". Tobin is no stranger to directing plays for the community however as he's long worked with The Necessary Stage.\n\nThe 30-minute play will be performed at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall and also at one of the domes at Gardens by the Bay, as part of TheatreWorks' Writing & Community programme started in 2008 when the Writers Lab first partnered the South East Community Development Council.\n\nThe whole idea is to identify potential playwrights, explains Tay Tong, the company's general manager, and then help them to develop their scripts into productions which are then staged outside the usual performance venues in the city.\n\n\"The performance series aims to bring works that resonate with the audiences who may not necessarily often go to the theatre,\" he adds.\n\nLife and death, passion and religious allegiances are certainly intriguing and thought-provoking enough to engage an audience, whose added advantage is to catch the first play by a young playwright with potential.\n\n'TheatreWorks Writers' Lab Writing & Community Programme: Performance Tour of Marco Polo' will be held from Feb 27-Mar 29, at various community venues.

The company said the Q4 results last year were primarily affected by a forex loss of US$4.8 million and the dry docking of vessels which were due for their five-year survey.\n\nFor the full year, Otto Marine made a net profit attributable to shareholders of US$14.08 million, compared with a loss of US$103 million in FY2012. Gross profit grew 450 per cent to US$46.5 million, led by higher profits from its chartering and shipbuilding business, while profit from leasing and subsea fell sharply.\n\nChartering gross profit doubled to US$31.3 million despite flat revenue of US$265.55 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 12 per cent compared with 6 per cent previously. The company said lower operating costs led to the higher profits. Chartering accounted for 67 per cent of group gross profit.\n\nOtto Marine owns and charters out a diversified fleet of 65 vessels ranging from ultra-large anchor handling tugs and supply vessels (AHTS) to crew transfer vessels, working with oil majors and offshore exploration and production companies.\n\nGross profit from the group's shipyard posted a turnaround to a profit of US$11.8 million compared with a loss of US$0.25 million previously. The group's shipbuilding, repair and conversion division was the second-largest contributor to gross profits.\n\nThe group also posted a gain of US$64 million on the deconsolidation of Reflect Geophysical, following a court order to wind up the company. This was offset by a doubtful debt provision of US$45.3 million for debts due from Reflect.\n\nThe group said it will continue to grow its chartering fleet and maximise utilisation rates and optimise efficiency in both the offshore services vessels (OSVs) and the subsea sectors.

Specifically, the levy for these workers (R2 work permit holders) employed within Man-Year Entitlement (MYE) will be increased from $600 to $700 while levies for higher-skilled workers will remain unchanged.\n\nDespite the fact that the levy hike will only take effect in two years, construction firms involved in larger projects which take a longer time to complete will still be affected, said Ho Nyok Yong, president of The Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL).\n\n\"Now he gives me the warning: 2016 is $700 (for R2 workers); it's 2014 now and before July, I was paying $450. If my project takes three years, I am still hit. Who compensates us? (If your pricing is) too competitive, you lose money; but if you price higher, you don't get the job,\" said Dr Ho.\n\nBut the writing has been on the wall for the construction industry for some time, said Selena Ling, head, treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank.\n\n\"Looking at construction productivity numbers, you can understand why they have to press on with the upgrading and restructuring process,\" she said. That being said, it is a bit of a \"double whammy\" for builders, she conceded.\n\n\"The government has said it is too early to do any unwinding of property measures which impacts demand side; and on the supply side, this levy hike won't help matters,\" Ms Ling said.\n\nBut measures aimed at helping construction firms were also rolled out.\n\nFor instance, firms looking to upgrade their R2 workers to R1 status will be provided with an additional avenue.\n\nThe Market-Based Skills Recognition Framework, which kicks in from Aug 1, will allow basic skilled workers who have worked in Singapore for at least six years and who earn a salary of at least $1,600 to upgrade to R1 status. Currently, work permit holders are required to pass a skills test and have at least four years' experience in Singapore before they are classified as higher skilled.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) estimates, some 17,000 existing R2 construction workers will be eligible for R1 status under the framework this year. As more work permit holders meet the salary and experience requirements over time, this figure is anticipated to grow.\n\nDr Ho lauded the move but stressed that the upgrading process would take time. At present, only about 10 per cent of the work permit holders are of R1 status, he said.\n\nAdditionally, to facilitate firms looking to retain experienced workers, the government will extend the maximum period of employment for R1 work permit holders from non-traditional sources and China from 18 to 22 years. This extension, which takes effect from May 1, will also apply to the marine and process sectors.\n\nThis measure is expected to help companies in these sectors retain 8,700 existing skilled workers for a longer period. These workers will have otherwise reached the maximum period of employment of 18 years within the next five years, said MOM in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe extension will not increase the number of work permit holders in Singapore as businesses are still required to keep within their dependency ratio ceilings, it added.\n\nThe measures introduced are part of a longer-term plan which will involve looking into mandating a minimum proportion of R1 work permit holders at the firm level to improve the skill profile of the foreign workforce, said Mr Tharman.\n\n\"We will continue to closely monitor the growth of foreign manpower in other sectors to ascertain whether further tightening measures, including levy increases, are needed for 2016 and beyond,\" he said.\n\nThat a carrot and stick approach was adopted should not surprise the construction industry, said Tan Tay Lek, partner at PwC Singapore.\n\n\"The tax benefit of the enhanced PIC (Productivity and Innovation Credit) incentive should go some way in relieving the industry of these transition pains although more sustained measures would be welcomed as this industry transformation process will not be achieved in the short term,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a range of upstream measures to tackle construction productivity were also introduced.\n\nFor selected government land sales (GLS) sites for instance, the use of productive technologies such as prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction and prefabricated bathroom units will be mandated in the tender conditions. JTC will also stipulate a minimum percentage level of prefabrication as part of the tender conditions for industrial government land sales (iGLS) sites.\n\nThe government will also continue to increase the legislated buildability scores and constructability scores for projects, said Mr Tharman.\n\nFrom September this year, private projects that are outside the GLS programme will need to meet the same higher standards as public sector projects and private sector projects on GLS/iGLS sites. This is expected to reap 9-14 per cent in manpower savings on such projects, he said.\n\nBut while such measures will reduce builders' reliance on manpower, views on the implementation remained mixed.\n\n\"The prefab units will be easier to use in projects where the designs are similar. If the designs are different, then using prefab will become a challenge,\" said Ong Jun Quan, executive director of Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering. \"The other downside to using prefab is that in terms of design and architecture, it may stifle creative designs and lead to boring architecture. But overall, it is a good thing for the industry to use as it will be cheaper and quicker.\"\n\nOther measures being rolled out include the requirement of standardised floor heights and building components such as drywalls for new projects, and encouraging developers to adopt productive technologies in developments on non-GLS sites.\n\n\"One of the complaints made previously by companies was that moves by the government were ad hoc. The announcements made in the Budget pull these measures together into a more complete approach which construction firms are likely to welcome,\" said Teo Han Jo, partner, building sector, at KPMG in Singapore.\n\n\"In addition, measures related to the upgrading of skilled workers to R1 or Higher Skilled status will contribute positively towards overall productivity and provide more certainty, and will be welcomed by the sector,\" he added.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But, do the measures announced go far enough to encourage more value-creation by businesses?\n\nWhile the government has heeded calls from the business community to encourage more innovation through investment in research and development (R&D), exploration of new markets, and building of new capabilities through adoption of information-communication technology (ICT), these measures are one step short of encouraging companies to focus more on the type of value-creation activities that can take Singapore on a path of sustainable long-term business performance.\n\nFirst, let us focus on the good news.\n\nThe extension of the popular Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme for another three years until Year of Assessment (YA) 2018 is a move in the right direction. As we had pointed out in our Budget Wishlist, the productivity journey is a long and continuous one.\n\nWhat is even better is the PIC+, which increases the expenditure cap to $600,000 a year up to a maximum of $1.8 million over three years. It is a tailor-made tax incentive for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), providing them with the necessary support to encourage equipment and technology investments for longer term and more sustainable business performance.\n\nCombined with existing broad-based measures such as the $5,000 Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) and the Capability Development Grant (CDG) schemes, businesses will be given a leg up in value-creation activities.\n\nBusinesses should be especially cheered by the extension of the research and development (R&D) incentives for a further 10 years to 2025 as the government clearly recognised that such innovation activities have a longer time-frame to bear fruit than productivity investments. And these were exactly what we had called for in our Budget Wishlist.\n\nThe push to encourage SMEs to adopt ICT through the ICT for Productivity and Growth (IPG) programme will also provide funding for companies, especially SMEs, to tap on more innovative ICT solutions for growth, beyond merely purchasing computers and software.\n\nBut while these measures and others, like the financing provided to support internationalisation, will help more companies in their bid to innovate, the not-so-good news is that all these incentives may not go far enough to support cash-strapped companies.\n\nIn particular, companies are allowed only to receive up to $60,000 in cash grants per year under the PIC, but which will not cover the more significant investments, especially in R&D.\n\nOne area that businesses may be particularly disappointed in is how there isn't more support for branding initiatives.\n\nCurrent incentives do not recognise the tangible nature of efforts to create a strong brand. Heeding KPMG's call for a tax incentive by way of a tax allowance for internally generated brands would have signalled the government's commitment to encourage pervasive innovation.\n\nBranding helps to improve competiveness of businesses. This is especially so with the regional goal of having the single Association of South East Asian Nations Economic Community (AEC) come on line in 2015. Singapore may have lost an opportunity in this year's Budget to place the Republic's businesses in a position of strength to exploit the potential benefits of the AEC.\n\nThis, perhaps, is something the government can look into for future Budgets to encourage local companies to pursue originality and value creation.\n\nAs the late Steve Jobs who made Apple the household name it is today once said: \"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower\", so it is that only through greater innovation can Singapore companies leapfrog ahead of their competitors.\n\nTay Hong Beng is Head of Tax, and Harvey Koenig, Partner, KPMG in Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But under CEVS, diesel cars of similar capacity are more likely to qualify for a higher rebate.\n\nTurning to the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) for commercial vehicles, he said the bonus COE period will be enhanced to further incentivise owners to replace their goods vehicles early.\n\nThe scheme was introduced last year to encourage the replacement of old commercial diesel vehicles to meet the new Euro V emissions standards. Owners who de-register their pre-Euro and Euro I vehicles before the end of statutory life pay lower, pro-rated COE premiums for their replacement vehicle, with the unused COE period and bonus COE period used to offset the Prevailing Quota Premium or PQP payable.\n\nMore details of the enhancement will be announced by the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources during the Committee of Supply debate.\n\nOne commercial vehicle dealer welcomed the news, saying the current discounted PQP is not attractive enough to encourage most owners to switch over to Euro V.\n\n\"(About) 38,000 old vehicles qualify under the scheme but, so far, fewer than 1,000 new units have been registered,\" he added, referring to the 614 commercial vehicles registered under ETS up until last month.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those immortal lines from the musical My Fair Lady came to mind one Sunday in January, when not rain, but wine came down on us from Spain, thanks to three of the country's most famous producers:\n\nDOMINIO DE PINGUS\n\nFlor de Pingus 2010 and 2009\n\nBoth Dominio de Pingus and Vega Sicilia sit on a plateau 600 metres above sea-level, thus experiencing a refined continental climate, with wide diurnal temperature differences especially in the summer.\n\nBoth vintages are very black red, 2009 darker than 2010. Rich aroma of very ripe fruit and liquorice. Stronger in 2009 with a touch of mint. Dense big wines, very ripe fruit, with taste of liquorice, caramel, mint, dried fruits especially prunes and plums. 2009 is denser.\n\nPingus 2010 and 2009\n\nBoth intensely almost black-red, with 2009 darker. Aromas of very ripe sweet fruit, lots of caramel, liquorice, coffee and good minerality. 2010 is more elegant and super-concentrated, while 2009 is perhaps a touch better balanced.\n\nALVARO PALACIOS, PRIORAT\n\nAlvaro's original winery which he started in Gratallops in the Priorato region, as a member of the Gratallops group led by Rene Barbier.\n\nGratallops 2011\n\nEighty per cent Garnacha (Grenache), 20 per cent Carinena (Carignan)\n\nBlack-red, lovely but with a faint nose of very ripe fruit; attractive palate of sweet ripe fruit, coffee, pears, soft tannins and good length. A very pleasing wine.\n\nFinca Dofi 2011\n\nHundred per cent Garnacha.\n\nA more serious wine, from very old vines. Black-red, with a sweet ripe fruit nose, palate of very ripe black berry fruit, chocolate, orange peel, touch of mint, and a long finish with citrusy notes. Very complex.\n\nL'Ermita 2011\n\nAlvaro's flagship wine. Ninety per cent Garnacha, 3 per cent Garnacha Blanca, 7 per cent Samso\n\nA huge wine, black-red, with the aroma of very sweet ripe berry fruit, a very dense concentrated wine with thick texture, touch of mint, and a long finish. Needs another decade!\n\nLa Montessa 2011, Palacios Remondo\n\nFrom the family winery in Alfaro, Rioja, which Alvaro took over on the death of his father a few years ago.\n\nEighty per cent Garnacha, 18 per cent Tempranillo, 2 per cent Mazuelo.\n\nA soft, very drinkable and likeable wine, good fruit, good length.\n\nPropriedad 2011, Palacios Remondo\n\nHundred per cent Garnacha.\n\nA more serious wine than Montessa. Darker red, with a light caramel-orange nose, good tannic structure, liquorice and black coffee on the palate. Needs ageing.\n\nBODEGAS DESCENDIENTES DE J PALACIOS, BIERZO\n\nVilla de Corullon 2011\n\nNinety per cent Mencia, 5 per cent white grapes.\n\nGood dense black-red, with a very sweet, ripe berry fruit aroma, coupled with a palate of liquorice and very ripe raisins; very big wine. Good introduction to Alvaro's Bierzo wines!\n\nLas Lamas 2011\n\nA single vineyard wine.\n\nA huge wine that's black-red, with a sweet citrusy and caramel bouquet. Very concentrated, with a very dense sweet palate, liquorice, lightly minty, lightly tannic long finish.\n\nLa Faraona 2011\n\nAlvaro's most exclusive wine from Bierzo, which comes from a small plot of vines in the middle of a very steep hill slope of 800 metres elevation.\n\nBlack-red with a faint aroma, dense, minerally, very ripe fruit, very precisely defined, a bit of an aristocrat, very long lightly tannic finish. Needs another 10 years.\n\nPABLO ALVAREZ\n\nPintia 2010, Bodega Pintia, Toro\n\nPintia is always a most enjoyable and drinkable wine from Vega's Pintia estate in Toro, to the west of the Ribera. Fruity and characterised by good balance and complexity, the 2010 is a worthy example. It has a lovely luscious seductive nose, with a very sweet thick-textured entry, thickly liquorous, but good minerality, with a long smooth finish. An excellent, well-priced easy-drinking wine.\n\nAlion 2010, Bodega Alion, Ribera del Duero\n\nAlion was acquired by the Alvarez family to produce a Ribera wine more in tune with contemporary wine tastes in contrast to the Vega, which continues serenely on the same course it has done since its inception.\n\nThis is like the Pintia, very likeable and very drinkable. Black purple, with a caramel butterscotch nose, big wine, cedar and coffee, and liquorice on the palate. Very long and quite aristocratic in style.\n\nMacan 2010, Bodegas Benjamin Rothschild & Vega Sicilia\n\nHundred per cent Tempranillo.\n\nVery black red, with a very dense black coffee on the palate with a touch of liquorice, cedar and mint. Long smooth finish. A medium-priced wine which should gain many followers. The problem is one would have to wait years for it to be ready to drink.\n\nValbuena 2010, Vega Sicilia\n\nNinety per cent Tinto Fino, 10 per cent Merlot.\n\nThis is always a most attractive wine, a junior edition of Vega's main wine, the Unico. Black-crimson, with vanilla, tangerine on a seductive bouquet; creamy texture, with orange, caramel and coffee on the palate, and very very long. A beauty.\n\nUnico Gran Reserva 2004, Vega Sicilia\n\nHundred per cent Tempranillo.\n\nPablo Alvarez believes this to be the successor to the famous 1970 Unico.\n\nImpenetrably black, with a lovely, seductive and elusive nose, touch of aniseed; concentrated sweet ripe fruit, slightly minty, goes on forever. Unico has never been a block-buster wine. Its hallmark is the suggestion of aristocracy in its bouquet and taste, a reserved nature and complexity being its strengths. This is very young, just been released, and will need another good five or more years to reach full maturity.\n\nUnico Gran Reserva 1994, Vega Sicilia\n\nA great vintage 10 years older than the preceding. A light orangey tint on the nose, a huge concentrated wine, refined and elegant, very complex, very long. Goes on and on. An aristocrat of a wine in its elegance and refinement.\n\nUnico Gran Reserva Especial, NV\n\n(Blend of 1990, 1994 & 1996 vintages of Unico Gran Reserva vintage.)\n\nBeginning to show brown tints in the otherwise deep red. A very very complex wine, with great class, refinement and elegance. A softish palate, very ripe fruit, very refined.\n\nAn appropriate finale to this near-monumental tasting of some of Spain's most iconic wines, entertainingly presented by Alvaro Palacios and studiously by Pablo Alvarez. Peter Sisseck unfortunately could not be present and his wines were presented by his great friend Alvaro Palacios.\n\nThis third session of the Paulee, which consists of Spanish wines, followed the Saturday's complete day of Burgundy wines. It was designed to act as a counterpoint to the extensive tasting of Burgundies, with the lighter-bodied Burgundies set off by the heavier-textured Spanish.

This was partially offset by the reduced fees from the Asia Dragon Fund as its investment assets are progressively divested.\n\nMeanwhile, the group's acquisition, divestment and performance fees grew 78 per cent year-on-year to $14.7 million. Excluding the unrealised marked-to-market gains/losses, the group would have achieved an adjusted net profit of $81.4 million for FY2013, 28 per cent higher year-on-year.\n\nAs at end-December, the group's asset under management (AUM) attained a new high of $25.5 billion.\n\n\"We are pleased to have achieved another year of strong results, particularly in the growth of our recurrent management fees and recurrent net profit by 11 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. Notwithstanding the persistent global economic uncertainties, we continued to grow our resilient earnings and increase our AUM,\" said John Lim, ARA Group chief executive officer.\n\nThe counter rose one cent to end trading at $1.735 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even when it comes to medical doctors. \"We had read up so much that we could tell what rubbish a lot of the GPs were telling us,\" says Mr Tan, 27, who is also the gym's programme director. Ritual offers a 30-minute workout session, comprising an intense 20-minute session that allows users to get in and out quickly.\n\nIt took over a year of consulting several GPs before they finally found Tucker Medical, which practises \"functional medicine\". Mr Robinson explains: \"If you have a lower back problem, most doctors will recommend surgery, or painkillers. But the problem is often in your ankle or knee, which is what this guy will try to find out.\"\n\nDr Steven Tucker of Tucker Medical says he joined forces with Ritual because the synergy is more effective in encouraging people to stay healthy. He says: \"People, not just 'patients', need regular feedback and counselling on lifestyle issues; the tie-ups help because now you have a team dedicated to improving your health.\"\n\nRitual also works with In Touch Physiotherapy which specialises in injury rehabilitation, and American family-owned shoe company Lems Shoes which sells minimalist shoes - lightweight footwear designed to minimise strain on the feet.\n\nFood-wise, eateries like Shoebox Canteen, Muchachos and Platypus Gourmet2Go have developed \"Ritual-style\" meals, usually comprising a main protein like chicken or fish, with extra vegetables and less carbohydrates. \"They're places that Brad and I eat at,\" says Mr Tan. \"We're not trying to advocate a super strict pro-athlete type of eating, we just want to give people good food choices.\"\n\nThe restaurants benefit as well, as they get customers directed their way. Shoebox Canteen's co-owner Beverly Yeoh observes: \"Increasingly we have more customers asking for non-carbohydrate meals so we recommend the Ritual-style meal we modified for them - by substituting the carbohydrates with more fresh vegetables.\" For example, their \"Ritual-style\" baked snapper ($18) is served with seasonal greens and fennel foam instead of couscous.\n\nNot just any eatery or service can be part of the Ritual style network - there is one important trait that they all must have. That is, they have to care about what they're doing, says Mr Tan. \"Our philosophy here is giving the best product and customer experience possible. I want my clients' 30 minutes at Ritual to be the best part of their day,\" adds Mr Robinson. \"We want to work with businesses that have the same idea - to go out of their way and make that extra effort.\"\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was despite higher interest expense and depreciation costs.\n\nGroup revenue increased by 77.7 per cent year-on-year to US$281.9 million for the year, while gross profit increased 88 per cent to US$133.2 million, with gross profit margins at 47 per cent, compared with 45 per cent previously.\n\nFinance costs for the year increased 57.4 per cent to US$12.2 million, largely because of the issue of S$270 million in notes under a Multicurrency Debt Issuance programme and higher bank loans to fund new service rigs and vessels.\n\nThe group had total financial liabilities of US$1.09 billion as at Dec 31, including the notes issue.\n\nDespite a 97 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to US$162.9 million, Ezion's tax bill decreased 32.8 per cent to US$2.6 million, helped by the tax exemption on charter income derived from Singapore flagged vessels under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act of Singapore.\n\nManagement said the group has seen \"an increased focus on platform- and well-related work by the oil majors in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and West Africa\".\n\nAs a result, the group expects to continue to invest in service rigs to meet the strong demand and to explore new ways to restructure its port and marine based business to allow the group to concentrate on its current key businesses.\n\nThe group announced on Feb 12 that it had terminated its bid to acquire a 45.15 per cent stake in mainboard-listed Ocean Sky.\n\nThe failed bid involved a reverse takeover plan by Ezion, which wanted to inject its marine supply base business in Australia, Ezion Offshore Logistics Hub, into Ocean Sky. Ocean Sky has interests ranging from construction and civil engineering to property management.\n\nIn its statement last week, Ezion said the reverse takeover would have resulted in \"protracted timings\" and all sides had agreed to terminate discussions relating to the plan. It added that because of conditions pertaining to the share subscription not having been met, the deal had lapsed.\n\nAnalysts remained upbeat on the stock, with 14 out of 15 rating it a \"buy\", with an average 12-month price target at $2.95.\n\nConsensus estimates for Ezion's FY14 net profit stand at US$228 million, and for FY15, US$282 million.\n\nThis means an average annual growth of 33 per cent on the back of a continued growth in its fleet of offshore service vessels. Based on the profit estimates, the price-earnings ratio for FY14 is at 9.7 times and for FY15, 7.9 times.\n\nEzion closed down one cent at $2.30 yesterday, with 5.4 million shares traded following the early-morning results announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When she launched her green smoothie business four years ago, she focused solely on taste - through her healthy blended fruit and vegetable concoctions.\n\nNow, Ms Tan is expanding to include the other six senses by teaming up with a nutritionist and yoga instructor in her newly launched LINS Smoodees Energy Detox Series.\n\nShe explains: \"I find that there are a lot of people coming to me and asking me: 'Where can I get this done?' and 'Where can I get that done?' Furthermore, since setting up LINS Smoodees, I have met so many healers and therapists. I was motivated to create a space for everybody to come to.\"\n\nOne of her partners is Biotailor, a nutrition consulting company run by Sujvot Sakhrani, senior nutritional consultant.\n\nMs Sakhrani conducts the clinical and holistic rejuvenator plan where, over two sessions, an analysis of the client's lifestyle and diet is carried out. This costs $400 (without blood test) and $480 (with blood test). According to Ms Sakhrani, a blood test which can be done at Huang Surgery at Valley Point, where LINS Smoodees is located, will provide a more accurate analysis. At the end of the sessions, a lifestyle management programme and diet plan, which may include Smoodees from LINS, is created for the client.\n\nMs Sakhrani believes that she and Ms Tan share a similar vision. She says: \"LINS Smoodees and Biotailor are both committed to enhancing the health of our clients through nutrition and lifestyle balancing. Supporting our clients and understanding what works for their unique bodies is the focal point of our services.\"\n\nAdds Ms Tan: \"We will work with you one-on-one and at your comfort level. We will then determine if you're ready to push the boundaries or if it is even necessary at all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, yoga instructor Johnson Anand Saurabh offers healing through mind and movement with a Mind, Body and Soul workshop scheduled for the middle of the year. The first workshop was conducted earlier in January and Ms Tan hopes that they can conduct a third one at the end of 2014. The workshop is helmed by Mr Saurabh while LINS Smoodees provides the food and drink.\n\nAccording to Mr Saurabh, the workshop's emphasis on meditation and yoga complements the LINS Smoodees detox. \"Adeline's liquid detox and raw food lightens up the body, allowing the person to more easily enter a state of peace,\" he explains.\n\nAside from the Energy Detox Series, Ms Tan also plans an April launch for The Healing Concierge which will oversee programmes such as the Energy Detox. This service will provide clients with referrals whenever they are in need of a health-related service. She adds: \"If clients come to me and I do not have ready contacts for what they want, I will source for them. If there are other detox programmes out there and I find that they are suitable for the client, I will refer them.\"\n\nBy Chew Hui-Yan\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, (those) who are less well-off will benefit more where there are higher underlying subsidies for all lower-income Singaporeans,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it was \"right and prudent\" to set aside money now to pay for the package while the country has sufficient resources to do so.\n\n\"With this fund, we assure the pioneer generation that Singapore will honour our commitment to them, regardless of future economic circumstances. The fund also ensures that Budgets in subsequent years can focus on the needs and challenges of the future, for all Singaporeans,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe explained that the $8 billion in the fund was not meant to cover the underlying healthcare subsidies that the pioneers receive together with all other Singaporeans. These, he said, would continue to be funded from future annual budgets.\n\nAs he outlined the different components of the package, Mr Tharman revealed that all pioneers would get annual top-ups of between $200 and $800 in their Medisave accounts, depending on their age group.\n\nHe assured the pioneer group that they will get subsidies to pay for their premiums under the new MediShield Life, the universal health insurance scheme that will cover all Singaporeans for life.\n\nOlder people will get more subsidies. Those aged 65 will get a 40 per cent cut, and this rate will go up to 60 per cent for those aged 90 and above.\n\nWith this combination of subsidies and Medisave top-ups, a person aged 80 or older will have his or her MediShield Life premiums fully covered. Those who are younger, around 70 years old this year, will pay about half of their current premiums.\n\nThe MediShield Life Review Committee is currently reviewing the benefits and premiums, which will be ready later this year. The subsidies will be implemented at the end of 2015, when the scheme is eventually rolled out.\n\nPioneers will get a 50 per cent discount off their bills at specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics, which will bring their total subsidies to 75-85 per cent of their bills. This, said Mr Tharman, is on top of the underlying subsidies that are means-tested.\n\nThose with moderate to severe disabilities will get an extra cash boost of $1,200 a year under a new Disability Assistance Scheme.\n\nAll pioneers will also be automatically included in the government's Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), which subsidises the cost of their visits to private general practitioners and dentists. In the past, only the lower and middle-income groups could qualify for this programme.\n\nMr Tharman recognised that there could be some who may have just missed out on the qualifying criteria for the Pioneer Generation Package but have \"good claims\" to be included. The government will set up a panel to assess these appeals on a case-by- case basis.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That included a gain of 22 per cent to 249 for the bigger models while mid-size and smaller planes fell 8.3 per cent to 429.\n\n\"We're heading in the right direction but we're definitely not out of the woods yet,\" Pete Bunce, the trade group's president, said in an interview. \"If you peel back the onion and parse the numbers a little bit, there are still significant problems in the light-to-mid area.\"\n\nChief executive officers from large companies are flying farther as international business expands, spurring demand for the biggest jets from makers such as Gulfstream Aerospace Corp and Dassault Aviation SA.\n\nManufacturers such as Textron Inc's Cessna that make smaller models still face a slow economic recovery, sparse financing and cheap used planes, Mr Bunce said.\n\nGulfstream, a unit of Falls Church, Virginia- based General Dynamics Corp, reported a shipment increase to 121 large-cabin planes from 83 in 2012, driven by the G650, its newest and biggest aircraft.\n\nDassault, based in Paris, delivered 43 of the Falcon 7X, its largest business jet, up from 37.\n\nProfits for members of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 19 per cent to a record US$981 billion last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's normally a good indicator for jet demand, Mr Bunce said.\n\nSales of smaller jets have been held back by sub-par economic growth in North America and Europe, which together accounted for 68 per cent of deliveries.\n\nBusiness-jet deliveries are expected to rise 10 per cent this year as the inventory of used planes falls and flight hours increase, Joseph Nadol, a JPMorgan Chase & Co analyst, said in a Feb 12 note. Mr Bunce declined to forecast 2014 shipments.\n\n\"New demand remains tentative for now and any recovery should be gradual,\" Mr Nadol wrote.\n\nAmong other general- aviation aircraft, shipments of turboprops rose 10 per cent last year from 2012, as a drilling boom in the US increased the need for planes that can land at small airports near oil and gas fields in shale formations, Mr Bunce said.\n\nDeliveries of even-smaller piston airplanes were up 2.7 per cent.\n\nShipments for all general-aviation aircraft, including business jets, turboprops and piston planes, climbed 4.3 per cent to 2,256. The value jumped 24 per cent to US$23.4 billion because of more large, expensive jets, Mr Bunce said. In 2008, 3,969 planes were shipped, with a value of US$24.8 billion.\n\nThis year, small and mid-sized jets will get a boost from new products that have begun or are about to start deliveries, including Cessna's Citation M2, Embraer SA's Legacy 500, Bombardier Inc's Learjet 75 and Honda Motor Co's first aircraft.\n\nAlmost all jet makers kept investing in new models even as sales lagged, Mr Bunce said.\n\nDuring the next few years, business-jet growth will depend mostly on the pace of the North American and European economies, he said. In the long run, demand from emerging markets will rise as new airports in countries such as China, Brazil and Indonesia allow more general-aviation flights, Mr Bunce said.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The TEC, which also commences in January next year, will cost the government $330 million.\n\nThe higher employer contribution rate will \"result in increased costs (for companies), somewhat cushioned in the first year,\" noted Grahame Wright, partner (human capital) at EY, adding that firms will have to bear the full amount once the TEC ends.\n\nHowever, Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) president Kurt Wee expects that the business community will be able to handle the higher costs, as firms would have been given around 10 months' notice before the scheme kicks in.\n\n\"We do not expect to make further changes soon to total CPF contribution rates beyond this one percentage point increase,\" said Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday. \"In the longer term, any further changes will have to be carefully considered by the tripartite partners, taking into account economic conditions, business costs and competitiveness.\"\n\nWith the higher Medisave contributions, elderly Singaporeans will also be able to use a portion of their Medisave more flexibly for outpatient treatments, Mr Tharman added. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong is expected to elaborate on this during the Committee of Supply (COS) debate.\n\nWith respect to MediShield Life, Mr Tharman said premiums would stay affordable for the lower- and middle-income groups, and the the government will provide \"significant permanent subsidies\" so MediShield Life premiums can be paid through Medisave, plus further assistance for those with financial difficulties. To help smoothen the transition for the first few years, another subsidy will help offset the expected increase in premium, with this being extended to the higher-income group as well.\n\nThe revised health insurance plan will cover all Singaporeans for life - including those with pre-existing medical conditions - and will aim to provide better benefits. An 11-member review committee, tasked with studying how best to frame MediShield Life, is due to submit its recommendations to the government in May.\n\nTo keep outpatient care more affordable, subsidies for the lower- and middle-income groups will be raised for specialist outpatient clinic (SOC) services from the current 50 per cent subsidy. From September, the subsidy will be bumped up to 70 per cent for the lower-income group and to 60 per cent for the middle-income earners. Enhanced subsidies are also expected down the line for medication.\n\nMr Tharman also threw in a sweetener for those who do not qualify for the Pioneer Generation package in order to help this segment of the population cope with healthcare expenses.\n\nSingaporeans aged 55 and above as at this year will receive an annual Medisave top-up of $100-$200 over the next five years, costing the government a total of $440 million. Those with an annual home value (as at Dec 31, 2013) of up to $13,000 will get a $200 Medisave top-up per year, while those with a value exceeding $13,000 or owning more than one property will get $100 a year.\n\nThe various initiatives are aimed at helping Singaporeans cope with higher healthcare costs as the nation grapples with an ageing population and healthcare cost inflation. As demand for healthcare continues to rise, Singapore will need to develop a quality talent pool for the social sector, including nurses, doctors, social workers and counsellors.\n\n\"In the coming years, we will be investing more in our people in the social sector,\" Mr Tharman said.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Coeur holds mining rights in Armenia.\n\nAdd an estimated $30 million to $50 million for the shell company and AP Strat could be worth more than $500 million after the deal is completed. Current AP Strat shareholders are expected to hold around 10 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the company. AP Strat had around $23 million of net assets as at end-2013, along with 134 million in share capital and 74 million outstanding warrants.\n\nThe book value of the target group that is being acquired as at Nov 30, 2013 is a net tangible liability of around \u00a3247,000 (S$520,000). The total value arrived at for AP Strat post-RTO is somewhat lower than an estimate of $667 million originally made last September, when China Global was going to buy 30 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the AP Strat for $200 million. \"Last time the number was just preliminary. But when China Global decided to set up a joint venture to hold (Coeur) with George, they started to negotiate, then had another set of (numbers),\" AP Strat chief financial officer Lee Keng Mun told The Business Times.\n\nIn the RTO transaction, 1.35 billion new shares in AP Strat will be issued (to GR Business) at a price of 37.1 cents a share - $500 million - after taking into account a preliminary financial appraisal of deposits done in end-2007, the current market price of gold and other metals, and the future business potential of the company.\n\nSeparately, AP Strat said that it will issue an additional 16.5 million non-listed transferable warrants to deal introducer Sim Chek Tong, who was previously issued 11 million warrants last December and currently holds 5.5 million warrants. Each additional warrant will carry the right to subscribe for a new share at 42.3 cents a share, and will raise an additional $7 million if all are exercised.\n\nAP Strat said it planned to dispose of its existing loss-making bereavement care services business. AP Strat resumed trading at 4pm yesterday. Its shares ended 2.5 cents lower at 45 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He now has 14 days to decide if he wants to appeal the sentence.\n\nLim's lawyer, Philip Fong of Harry Elias Partnership, said that his client will be taking the time to consider his options, though he added that Lim would \"like to put this behind him as soon as possible\".\n\nIt is understood that the prosecution, which had on Monday asked for a jail term of 18 months, will also be considering whether to appeal.\n\nDistrict Judge Eddy Tham, in pronouncing the sentence yesterday, agreed with the prosecution's submissions that Lim's actions had generated public disquiet and hurt confidence in the public service, \"as it involved a high ranking public officer who had deceitfully obtained public funds by virtue of his position and the trust reposed in him\".\n\nHe also agreed that Lim's actions were \"deliberate and conscious conduct with planning and premeditation . . . emboldened presumably by the ease to commit the acts multiple times until he was found out\".\n\nLim had served as the highest-ranking protocol officer at MFA before he was charged in October last year. The civil servant was then in charge of the MFA directorate responsible for organising ministerial and presidential visits, and oversaw policies on diplomatic privileges and immunities.\n\nHe was accused of cheating the ministry of almost $90,000, between February 2008 and May 2012, by inflating the claims he made on thousands of boxes of pineapple tarts and hundreds of bottles of wine supposedly bought for official ministerial trips. Lim either did not use any or all of the tarts and wine he claimed for, and submitted false receipts to support his fictitious claims.\n\nHe admitted on Monday to 10 charges of cheating, amounting to $35,160 worth of inflated claims. The remaining 50 charges against him were taken into consideration for his sentencing.\n\nEach charge, under Section 420 of the Penal Code, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' jail and a fine.\n\nIn arguing for a lesser sentence, Mr Fong had said on Monday that there were extenuating circumstances surrounding his client's actions. He said that Lim inflated the claims only to make up for the expenses he had incurred in buying gifts for foreign diplomats whenever they hosted events in Singapore.\n\nMr Fong said Lim told him that it is not MFA's official policy to give gifts at such local functions, therefore, any MFA officials who gave gifts to these Singapore-based foreign diplomats would not be reimbursed for what they had spent.\n\nSo, in his attempt to overcome what he felt was \"bureaucratic red tape\", Lim overstated his claims to make up for these expenses.\n\nJudge Tham, however, disagreed with this argument, pointing out that Lim clearly knew the rules and that he was \"in blatant breach of policy\". He also noted that Lim did not produce any evidence supporting this argument.\n\nJudge Tham added: \"It is tragic that a person who had risen through the ranks to attain a high position and who has stated in his mitigation plea that he possesses a 'strong sense of public duty' could so tarnish all the accolades he had received and betray the trust reposed in him. He did not have sense to know that he had crossed the line when he first manufactured false receipts and inflated claims to deceive his employer and continued to do so repeatedly.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last August, it partnered Mubadala for the Nong Yao oil development in the G11/48 contract area, also in the Gulf of Thailand and of which it has a one-quarter stake.\n\nKrisEnergy's shares fell one cent to end trading at $0.755 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But that figure includes previously announced plans to sell its US retail business Citizens, which accounts for 18,300 jobs, and a UK retail business, Williams & Glyn, which employs 4,500.\n\nRBS was rescued by a \u00a345.5 billion (S$96.1 billion) government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, the future of its investment bank and Citizens has been a source of friction between RBS's management and Britain's finance ministry.\n\nFinance Minister George Osborne wants RBS to be more like state-backed rival Lloyds Banking Group, which has minimal investment banking operations and concentrates on domestic lending. Lloyds is expected to return fully to private ownership in the next 12 months while RBS is three to five years away.\n\nFormer RBS CEO Stephen Hester clashed with politicians over their desire to see RBS's investment bank scaled back, and this contributed to his departure last year. Ross McEwan, who replaced him, will unveil the outcome of a strategic review of the business alongside the bank's full-year results next Thursday.\n\nNumis analyst Mike Trippitt said that the plans were a positive development subject to restructuring costs and the impact on the bank's capital position. \"It has been clear for some time that the government has wanted RBS to retrench to a UK focused retail and commercial bank,\" he said.\n\nRBS said last November that it would create an internal \"bad bank\" to fence off its riskiest assets, part of measures to repair its strained relationship with the government and prepare the bank for privatisation.\n\nAnalysts at Citi yesterday said that RBS had yet to provide a credible business plan on the future direction and strategy of the remaining \"good bank\". \"In the near term, we expect it will be extremely difficult for new CEO McEwan to turn around the profitability of the bank,\" they said in a research note.\n\nOne source familiar with the matter said that RBS's remaining investment banking activities could be incorporated into its corporate business.

By taking more than 50 per cent control, OSIM has to consolidate the company's financial statements onto its books. That a gain was recorded after consolidation means TWG Tea had gone up in market value since the time it was first recorded on OSIM's books at cost.\n\nTWG Tea was valued at around $90 million when OSIM first bought its 35 per cent equity stake for $31.4 million. The $42 million gain for OSIM's 53.7 per cent stake suggests that TWG Tea itself had gained $78 million in market value (before accounting adjustments) since the time OSIM first bought into it three years ago. This works out roughly to a compounded gain of more than 20 per cent a year.\n\nHaving become profitable in 2013, TWG Tea is likely to boost OSIM's bottom line in no small way. A future initial public offering (IPO) could unlock further value for TWG Tea's shareholders.\n\nAt the same time, it is not clear if OSIM is free to enjoy its nice cup of tea.\n\nOSIM's founder Ron Sim, chief financial officer Peter Lee, independent non-executive director Khor Peng Soon, together with TWG Tea, its co-founder Taha Bouqdib, and a former vehicle of Mr Bouqdib that is now an OSIM subsidiary, are now being sued by former TWG Tea CEO and co-founder Manoj Murjani and the company he chairs, The Wellness Group, for \"minority oppression\".\n\nThe Wellness Group now holds 30 per cent of TWG Tea, down from 54.7 per cent originally after OSIM first bought into it. OSIM had increased its stake to 70 per cent over three developments: after founding members failed to meet performance targets as announced in an OSIM press release last July, after a share purchase last October from a vehicle formerly majority owned by Mr Bouqdib, and after a rights issue last month.\n\nMr Murjani is alleging, among other things, that his fellow shareholders have conspired to damage the profitability of TWG Tea and enabled OSIM to take control of the company. He had resigned from TWG Tea in September 2012.\n\nOSIM has said that the allegations were \"unmeritorious and groundless\". It and TWG Tea will be filing their defence and counterclaim, and court proceedings will take their course.\n\nIt is unfortunate that a fast-rising, made-in-Singapore star is now embroiled in legal issues. Whether OSIM might have got more trouble than it bargained for remains to be seen.\n\nBut TWG Tea, which is expanding to North Asia and the region, and plans to hit 50 outlets at the end of this year from just 16 at end-2012 and 26 at end-2013, has certainly come a long way.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Costs and manpower are the very issues businesses seem most anxious to hear about from Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam when he delivers the Budget speech today.\n\nSingapore's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.5 per cent in Q4 from a year ago, shooting past the flash estimate of 4.4 per cent to beat the market consensus forecast of 5.2 per cent growth as well. This meant a quarter-on-quarter annualised rate of 6.1 per cent growth - far better than the government's advance estimate of a 2.7 per cent contraction.\n\nThese unusually large upward revisions were in part due to statistical adjustments to 2012's figures. Singapore grew 1.9 per cent in 2012, not 1.3 per cent as reported earlier, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said yesterday.\n\nBut the revisions also came from better-than-expected industrial production in December. Manufacturing grew 7 per cent year-on-year in Q4, up from a 3.5 per cent flash estimate, driven by \"simultaneous spikes in output from the biomedical and electronics sectors\", said DBS economist Irvin Seah.\n\nThe services and construction sectors' growth rates for Q4 were also revised up to 5.9 per cent and 4.8 per cent year-on-year respectively, though both eased from Q3's pace. High labour costs may have compressed the margins of construction firms despite a healthy pipeline of projects, said Mr Seah. He thinks wage costs weighed services' growth down too, though stronger regional growth boosted the trade- related, tourism and financial services segments.\n\nSingapore's full-year growth was revised to 4.1 per cent, up from the 3.7 per cent Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced in his new year message.\n\nThis was despite a 6 per cent contraction in Singapore's key non-oil domestic exports for the full-year - a worse performance than the 4-5 per cent drop International Enterprise (IE) Singapore had forecast.\n\nAs manufacturing began to recover its rhythm only in the second half of 2013, the financial services and the wholesale trade sectors clocked the strongest contribution to growth last year.\n\nMTI permanent secretary Ow Foong Pheng said the official growth forecast for 2014, which remains at 2-4 per cent growth, takes into account that the global economy will \"improve modestly\". The US economy is slated to improve as fiscal cutbacks ease, and private consumption and investments rise; and the eurozone recovery is set to gain traction. Nearer home, China's growth will moderate as Beijing pushes out reforms to drive the economy towards consumption-driven growth, but Asean economies are expected to stay resilient, Mrs Ow said.\n\nThe global recovery will benefit Singapore's external-facing sectors, but MTI cautioned that the things to watch for include how the lack of certainty over the pace of the US quantitative easing (QE) tapering weighs on financial markets and business sentiment, and the potential unintended consequences of China's policy adjustments.\n\nAlso, growth for labour- intensive, domestic-facing sectors may be constrained by tight labour market conditions - set to get even tighter as foreign levies rise another notch in July. Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan thinks that more foreign labour curbs may be unveiled in today's Budget statement.\n\nLabour, rental and utilities costs account for 78 per cent of manufacturing SMEs' total business costs and 85 per cent of large manufacturers', an MTI study found.\n\nUpward pressure on rents is slated to ease with the strong supply of industrial and commercial space in the pipeline; and utilities cost increases may ease as global oil prices moderate. But the tight labour market will continue to feed higher wage costs into unit labour cost (ULC) increases this year, said MTI's economics division director Yong Yik Wei.\n\nThe ULC rise moderated from 5.3 per cent in 2012 to 3.1 per cent in 2013, but Citi economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan noted that ULC growth picked up in Q4. This points to cost pressures and reinforces the need for an enhanced Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) to bolster the cashflow of SMEs in domestically oriented sectors, they said.\n\nMs Yong said: \"ULC is also a function of productivity; if productivity gains traction and improves, that should improve.\" Unfortunately, labour productivity growth was flat last year, though it did not fall as it had in 2012, by 2 per cent.\n\nBut Mrs Ow said SMEs' take-up rate of productivity initiatives launched by the government has been encouraging, and expects productivity - especially for the manufacturing sector - to improve. \"Productivity is driven, of course, not only by the bottom line but also the topline, as we grow and expand into new markets,\" she added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The firms are Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Latham & Watkins and Norton Rose Fulbright.\n\nAnother firm awarded the licence in 2008, White & Case, has been given a one-year conditional licence, which could be extended by four years if the firm meets \"certain quantitative targets\" set by MinLaw.\n\nThe ministry did not elaborate.\n\nThe QFLP licensing scheme allows foreign law firms granted such a licence to practise Singapore law in \"permitted areas of legal practice\", mainly in commercial areas of law; they are barred from areas such as constitutional and administrative law, conveyancing, criminal law, family law, succession law and conduct of litigation.\n\nWithout the licence, Herbert Smith Freehills will cease practice as a QFLP.\n\nThe firm's South-east Asia managing partner Michael Walter said the firm has other strategic initiatives in mind, even though it remains strongly committed to Singapore after 25 years here. \"Our practice in Singapore is primarily international, working with our clients on significant cross-border matters. We do not believe that operating under our own licence is the only way to service our clients' Singapore law requirements.\"\n\nMinLaw will, however, give the firm a six-month extension of its licence beyond April 30, the expiry date, so the firm has until Oct 31 to make a smooth transition out of the QFLP scheme.\n\nMr Walter said that after October, the firm \"will have new arrangements in place to support our ambitions and those of our clients in Singapore and the wider region\".\n\nLatham & Watkins' chair and managing partner Robert Dell said of the renewal of the firm's QFLP status here: \"Singapore is a great success story, and it has shown both extraordinary vision and resourcefulness to strengthen its role as one of the leading financial and legal centres of the world. Singapore is an economic powerhouse and it is a major regional business and legal hub. It remains a strategically important market for our growth plans in the region and globally.\"\n\nMinLaw said that, in determining whether a foreign firm's licence is renewed, it takes into account the firm's quantitative and qualitative performance in the preceding five years; it also considers the firm's renewal proposals for the next five years in terms of the value of work the firm's Singapore office will generate, the number of lawyers based in the firm's Singapore office, the strength of the practice areas of its Singapore office and the extent to which the office will function as the firm's headquarters for the region.\n\nHerbert Smith, a member of the Silver Circle of leading law firms in the United Kingdom, merged with Freehills, one of the Big Six law firms in Australia, in October 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

About one-third of heart attacks are silent\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBOTH men had silent heart artery disease but only one escaped the clutches of death. Mr A , head of a public-listed company, was in his 60s, was careful with his diet and exercised regularly. His doctors had not mentioned the presence of heart artery disease and hence, he never had a scan of his heart arteries.\n\nOn that fateful day, he had just finished his daily routine but somehow felt more tired than usual. He went to bed and never woke up. The autopsy confirmed significant heart artery disease as the cause of his sudden death.\n\nA different fate\n\nMr B was in his late 40s and had undergone a treadmill test the previous year which was reported as normal. He had no chest pain but his bad cholesterol level was highly elevated. His doctor had advised him to do vigorous exercise in the mistaken notion that exercise will burn off the bad cholesterol. The reality is that research studies have shown that vigorous exercise not only does not lower bad cholesterol but can also increase the likelihood of sudden death in those at risk.\n\nHis family advised him to seek further evaluation as he was in the high risk category. An outpatient scan of the heart arteries, which was completed in a few seconds, confirmed the presence of extensive and severe narrowing of his major heart arteries.\n\nThis week, Mr B underwent opening of his heart arteries through a small 2mm access site in his leg artery under local anaesthesia. New generation absorbable cylindrical polymer meshes were expanded by tubings with balloons and placed in the narrowed segments of the heart arteries to fully open the arterial lumen. By the next day, Mr B was given a new lease of life and was ready to go back to his usual routine without fear of sudden death from heart disease. In three years' time, the polymer meshes in his heart arteries will be absorbed by the body and his heart arteries will have been restored to their natural state.\n\nNo chest pain\n\nMost people make the assumption that if they do not have chest pain, even while exercising, they do not have any underlying heart problems. However, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, USA, states that about one-third of heart attacks are silent.\n\nThese silent heart attacks tend to affect the old, elderly and the diabetic.\n\nAs in the case of Mr A and Mr B, men can have severe underlying heart disease without the presence of any symptoms. While left-sided chest discomfort is the most typical symptom, it can also present as upper body discomfort involving one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the abdomen.\n\nSometimes, the only symptom is shortness of breath. Other less common symptoms of a heart attack include cold sweats, a sensation of being unusually fatigued without any obvious reason, nausea and vomiting or sudden dizzy spells.\n\nTherefore, while chest discomfort is the most commonly recognised symptom, the presence of these other less common symptoms in high-risk individuals should alert one to the possibility of an impending heart attack or underlying heart disease.\n\nFalse confidence\n\nTreadmill stress testing has been used for decades to assess the presence of underlying blockage of the heart arteries. One should be aware that a normal treadmill stress test result does not mean that there is no severe narrowing of a major heart artery.\n\nThe worst thing that can happen is when an individual with severely diseased heart arteries who has had a normal treadmill test result, believes that he has no underlying heart disease and embarks on vigorous physical exercise.\n\nIn a publication in Circulation journal in 1980 by Silverberg, treadmill testing in patients with significant heart artery disease showed a sensitivity of 59 per cent and a specificity of 69 per cent. What this means is that if a hundred individuals with severe heart artery disease were to undergo treadmill stress testing, 41 per cent will have a normal treadmill stress test result.\n\nIt also means that in that published study, among those without underlying heart artery disease, 69 per cent were correctly identified as having no underlying heart disease and 31 per cent had an abnormal treadmill stress test result despite being healthy.\n\nChoice between life and death\n\nIf you have symptoms suggestive of heart disease or you have multiple risk factors for heart disease, even if the treadmill stress test result is normal, advice should be sought from your doctor as to whether you will benefit from more accurate assessment. Non-invasive tests for heart artery disease can be divided into two broad categories.\n\nThe first category of tests assesses the adequacy of blood flow to the heart muscle when the heart is put under stress.\n\nThe underlying rationale is that if there is severe narrowing of the heart artery, the blood flow may not be sufficient to meet the increased demand when the heart is stressed and this will be manifested as reduced heart muscle function on ultrasound (stress echocardiography) or decreased distribution of radioactive isotopes in the areas of heart muscle with decreased blood flow (myocardial nuclear perfusion scan or PET scan).\n\nThe main drawback of these tests is that by attempting to assess the blood flow, they are an indirect means of assessing heart artery disease and do not provide any direct images on the status of the heart arteries. Hence, the tests can be normal even if there is complete occlusion of a major heart artery as long as there is adequate cross supply from other arteries in the heart.\n\nThe second category of tests allows direct visualisation of the heart arteries and the tests available currently include Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart arteries or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the heart arteries.\n\nCT scan of the heart arteries can be completed in seconds and involves the use of special X-ray machines and the injection of iodine-based contrast media. The radiation dose and the accuracy varies from centre to centre.\n\nIn a USA study on 50 hospitals using similar 64-slice CT scanners to scan the heart arteries, the radiation dose in the hospital with the highest radiation dose was six times higher than the hospital with the lowest radiation dose.\n\nIn a highly experienced centre, CT scan of the heart arteries can be both accurate and safe. MRI scan of the heart arteries is a relatively newer modality and can be performed without any X-ray radiation or any contrast injection. The major limitations of this technique are that it is not widely available and may not be suitable for some patients who have metal implants.\n\nUnderstanding the options available may help patients make an informed choice. For patients who are at high risk of heart disease, knowing whether their heart arteries are severely blocked or not can make a big difference between life or death.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

The store is the brainchild of Rosalind Lim, who runs a luxury jewellery business. inRoads is her \"hobby\", she says.\n\nNoticing how her friends were constantly travelling, or in some cases moving from one country to another, Ms Lim got the idea to retail furniture that could be considered keepsake pieces, but which its owners could also take with them on their travels.\n\nThe store carries pieces by Prizmic and Brill, founded in 1986 by Matthew Sven Brill and Vinko Mario Prizmic. Based in the Philippines, the brand solely makes furniture pieces that have a travel or safari theme to them.\n\n\"All the pieces are made to be mobile, just like how things are when one is travelling,\" says Ms Lim. Many of the pieces look like conventional trunks, but turn out to be much more.\n\nOne example is a bed trunk, which retails for $5,990. It looks like a conventional trunk but turns into a coffee table when shut. Undo its catch, and the trunk can become a single bed, or when folded in half, can be used as a two-seater sofa. Elsewhere in the showroom, is a TV console, complete with drawers on the side, which again, when shut, looks like a trunk, albeit a massive one.\n\nThere are also chests of drawers that look like trunks, coffee tables with the same look and even a desk, which can be packed away into a compact trunk. Most of the trunks come in a variety of finishings, such as canvas, wicker, or in mock crocodile or snake-embossed leather. \"The pieces have a masculine look, so even if they don't work in the living room, they can work well in the den,\" says Ms Lim.\n\nPrizmic & Brill offers more than trunks, from foldable chairs, to modular sofas and writing desks. There is even a safari tent for sale, should anyone fancy one. Its signature style combines hardwood, hand-forged brass, nickel and leather hides for its pieces.\n\nMs Lim says that most of the customers are local working professionals in their 30s. \"But we get more men than women who are excited about the range,\" she says. In Asia, Prizmic & Brill pieces can be found in hotels such as The Peninsula in Hong Kong and the Soneva Kiri Six Senses resort in Thailand.\n\nMs Lim says she came to know of the brand after a friend introduced her to Mr Brill. \"I liked the vintage look of the pieces and yet they are still very functional. I'm sure customers do not want white elephants in their home,\" she says.\n\nWith most of the pieces in the form of trunks, Ms Lim adds that when it comes to moving house, it will be a breeze to take the furniture along. \"You can tell the movers to just collect the trunks,\" she quips.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net profit rose 23 per cent to $67.55 million.\n\nAspial attributed its better performance to an improvement in all its businesses.\n\nRevenue from the property business grew 23.2 per cent, from $196.2 million to $241.8 million. The growth was contributed by the recognition of sales from Urban Vista, East Village, Cardiff Residence and 8 Bassein.\n\nThe jewellery business continued to consolidate its retail stores in 2013, leading to the closure of 11 retail stores and the opening of 10 new ones, mostly in new shopping malls. Despite the fewer number of retail stores, the business achieved higher revenue in 2013. This was mainly contributed by improved sales from existing retail stores. Revenue rose 4.2 per cent to $170.1 million.\n\nEarnings per share were 0.54 cent and 4.06 cents for Q4 and the full year, respectively. A two cent per share final dividend has been proposed.\n\nMeanwhile, Aspial added to its overseas property portfolio with a A$18.89 million (S$21.49 million) acquisition of vacant land in Cairns, Australia. The 24,109-square metre space in Cairns' central business district was acquired from Central Park Cairns by Aspial's subsidiary, WCL-Central Park (QLD).\n\nWCL intends to turn the property into a large integrated development with about 1.2 million square feet of offices, retail and residential units.\n\nAspial shares ended 2.5 cents higher at 46 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/whatsup-facebook", "site_title": "WhatsUp, Facebook?", "publish_date": null, "content": "WhatsUp, Facebook?\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Facebook has tightened the screws on telcos with a US$19 billion buyout of WhatsApp, becoming a tentacled triumvirate of InstaWhatFace following its Instagram acquisition in 2012.\n\nWhile the market reeled from sticker shock, the price tag makes sense in deranged Silicon Valley terms, analysts think. Its per-user valuation of US$42 is at home on the wildly varying spectrum of previous valuations.\n\nLarger numbers are at stake, like the US$120 billion from global SMS revenue. Now, WhatsApp - the world's most formidable app with more than 450 million monthly active users - will team up with Facebook in an all-out assault on communication.\n\nThis will happen on at least two fronts. Facebook's own app, Messenger, targets the \"informal email\" channel - the one we use when an instant reply is not expected.\n\nNow, Facebook will close the loop with Whats- App, the SMS-substitute for when a swifter response is required. WhatsApp is a mobile play, and while Messenger is a mobile app, it is best used in its browser iteration. Both parties are coy about monetisation, insisting that growth takes priority. \"We don't expect (WhatsApp) to have a detailed plan for monetisation yet and we're not in a hurry,\" Facebook told The Business Times yesterday.\n\nStill, advertising and frivolous add-ons can be ruled out in the short term.\n\n\"You can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication,\" a blog post by WhatsApp founder Jan Koum said yesterday. Mr Koum, who was born in Ukraine and once stood in line for food stamps, is believed to be worth almost US$7 billion, thanks to the buyout.\n\nWhatsApp is also unlikely to hawk stickers and games, as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg told analysts that WhatsApp would not be \"adding lots of bloated features\".\n\nNow, WhatsApp's revenue comes from the 99 US cents that users pay annually after the first free year of usage. This is not expected to increase for now. \"It hasn't been, and won't be, the top priority to optimise revenue in the short term,\" said David Ebersman, Facebook's CFO, yesterday.\n\nWhat looms, however, is a relentless geographical and technological expansion for WhatsApp on Facebook's muscle. \"When (WhatsApp) goes into a country, they don't rest until their service is faster than SMS and as reliable,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn the coming months, WhatsApp will refine message delivery speed, application reliability and its impact on smartphone battery life, WhatsApp's Mr Koum said.\n\nIf this sounds unsexy and reminiscent of the telco sector, it is because Facebook is gunning for its market. WhatsApp handles 53 billion messages a day - almost the size of the world's SMS volume.\n\nNow, WhatsApp's next target is one billion users - not far off with its rate of one million new users a day. Once achieved, there will be \"clear ways that we can monetise\", Mr Zuckerberg said.\n\nThis will come at telcos' expense. SMSes might be under siege, but it still brought in US$120 billion in revenue last year which will be sorely missed if WhatsApp successfully monopolises global messaging.\n\nThis is not to say that a firm like SingTel will take it lying down. The telco, which quietly scrapped WhatsApp-challenger LoopMe last year, was working on what it swore was \"something that is just as good\", according to top executive Allen Lew last November.\n\n\"I think (SingTel) would like their own service to compete directly with WhatsApp, to address the fact that a service like that is piggybacking on its network,\" said Clive McDonnell, chief equity strategist for Standard Chartered Singapore.\n\nWith 501 million mobile customers across 25 countries, SingTel's scale makes the venture worthwhile. \"It makes excellent business sense, but the catch is, we don't know if it can take off . . . We don't even know what the service will look like,\" Mr McDonnell said.\n\nWith Facebook's weight behind WhatsApp, SingTel will have to squint extra hard at its own potential offering, whatever it may be.\n\nEven so, WhatsApp will be unable to recreate the fat margins of telco yesteryear on 99 US cents a year. Instead, the value will lie in data, analysts believe.\n\n\"There is . . . potential for Facebook to leverage WhatsApp data to help drive improved monetisation on other Facebook products,\" a Macquarie report said.\n\nThese are nebulous ideas, but few dare say that this deal makes no sense. The US$1 billion Instagram buyout now looks like a good deal, two years on.\n\nIn 2010, a Time magazine profile of Mr Zuckerberg noted his disconcerting tendency to stare elsewhere mid-conversation, looking \"off to one side as if he's hearing noises offstage\". Today, the market gives him much leeway, perhaps conceding that Mark Zuckerberg is indeed looking elsewhere - seeing possibilities that the rest of us can't.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The flash output index rose to 57.2 from 53.5. Job hiring trends continued to be positive, with the employment index rising to 54.0 from 53.2.\n\nMr Williamson noted that the backlog of work showed the largest rise since prior to the financial crisis as well as a steep fall in inventories. \"Both point to ongoing growth of production and hiring in March,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, the cost of living in the US rose at a slower pace in January, a sign that inflation was restrained in early 2014.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1 per cent after a 0.2 per cent gain the prior month, a Labor Department report showed yesterday. The median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.1 per cent rise. The CPI climbed 1.6 per cent from a year earlier.

He also suggests it could be a Holocaust museum.\n\nThe factory once belonged to Mr Schindler, a Czech-German industrialist, spy and a member of the Nazi party who sheltered about 1,200 Jews there in the final months of the Second World War. Their story was featured in Steven Spielberg's Academy award-winning 1993 film Schindler's List.\n\nThe complex \"has real potential\", Mr Kaspar said, looking at the cluster of abandoned buildings from the window of his second-floor office perched on a small hill above the factory. He does acknowledge that for now, \"it looks like Dresden after the bombing\". The complex has been the subject of almost 100 civil and criminal lawsuits since it went bankrupt 10 years ago. Mr Kaspar says that those disputes are close to being resolved, and says that the town would offer it for a symbolic sum to an investor with the resources to clean it up and create jobs in the town 190km east of Prague.\n\nIn November, a Prague court made a preliminary judgment that would allow the property to be sold, and Mr Kaspar expects a final ruling this spring. He says that he's in talks with an investment group with potential access to European Union funds for environmental remediation.\n\nMr Schindler, who ran a cookware factory in Krakow that had been converted to arms production, moved the plant and its Jewish workers to Brnenec in 1944 as the Soviet Red Army approached Poland. Originally a textile plant owned by a Jewish family, the Brnenec site was given to Schindler thanks to his ties to the Abwehr, or Nazi secret service. He managed to keep many of his employees out of Auschwitz by telling the German government that they were skilled labourers.\n\nAfter the war, Mr Schindler fled Czechoslovakia, where he was wanted as a war criminal because of his membership in the Abwehr. He went first to Germany and then South America, where he ran a string of unsuccessful businesses and ended up being supported by Jewish groups. In 1962, a tree was planted in his honour at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.\n\nThe Brnenec factory was nationalised after the Communists took over Czechoslovakia in 1948. The textile company, called Vitka, remained the region's main employer until the mid-1990s, when it stumbled on the Czech Republic's road to capitalism. The once-prosperous supplier of non-flammable seat covers to car maker Skoda and Czech Airlines changed owners several times in quick succession and went bankrupt in 2004.\n\nToday, the machinery has been stolen, windows broken, and the WWII-era heavy bolted doors dismantled and carted away. The crumbling roof tiles let snow and water seep inside. And textile dyes and other poisons dumped on the factory grounds - next to the Brnenec railway station and elementary school - will require remediation that Mr Kaspar estimates will cost some 40 million koruna (S$2.5 million).\n\nA sale of the property would open the door for Mr Kaspar's plan to create a memorial to Holocaust victims by turning some of the historical buildings into a museum. They include Schindler's house and the men's barracks that flank the Appell Platz, where workers lined up for daily roll calls.\n\nBrnenec \"is the right place to remember\", said Monika Bednarek, curator of the Schindler Factory Museum in Krakow. \"The most important part of the story happened there, not here in Krakow.\"\n\nTomas Kraus, the director of the Czech Federation of Jewish Communities, calls the museum a \"fantastic idea\". His group doesn't have enough money to fund the Brnenec project, but Mr Kraus says that he is confident he can find overseas backing for a museum if the property dispute is resolved. While the history of places such as Brnenec was largely ignored by the Czechoslovak Communist government, he says that it's important that Czechs not forget their country's Jewish heritage. \"The memorial should have been made right after the movie was released,\" he said. \"This is our last chance before it falls apart.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

As one of them said: \"If you come to our dealing room, you'll see most of us hunched over our computers - not trading or anything like that, but playing computer games.\"\n\nIn yesterday's session, when the advance-decline score excluding warrants was 197-222, some 1.7 billion units worth $1.2 billion were traded. Active punting of Thai Beverage helped add some spice to the session, the stock rising 5 cents to 56 cents on volume of 72 million done. The beer brewer reported a 33 per cent drop in net profit to 19.1 billion baht for the year ended Dec 31, 2013, but pointed out that reported profit for the year ended 2012 included a one-off gain from the company's acquisition of a 29 per cent stake in Fraser & Neave. Excluding that gain, the latest reported profit would have been 18 per cent higher.\n\nAmong shipyards, Yangzijiang's shares ended unchanged at $1.135 with 7.7 million done. The China firm's stock was the subject of several \"buy\" calls throughout the week - DBS, for example, set a $1.33 target, while Macquarie Equities Research's target is $1.45. OCBC Investment Research, on the other hand, issued a \"hold\" on the counter, saying results were within expectations and based on 9x FY14 earnings, its fair value for Yangzijiang has been reduced from $1.22 to $1.21.\n\nTranscu's shares, in the meantime, were heavily traded on news that it is to be the vehicle for a backdoor listing by contractor Straits Construction. The counter yesterday fell 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent with 45.3 million done.\n\nBlumont, one of the three stocks designated by SGX last October when its price fell 90 per cent in one day, saw its shares inch 0.1 cent up to 6.2 cents with 51.7 million shares traded after announcement of its takeover plan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

About 50,000 jobs in the nation's car and parts industry are in jeopardy after Toyota Motor Corp this month followed Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co in announcing plans to quit making cars in the country, while Alcoa Inc this week said that it will close an aluminium smelter and two mills with the loss of 980 jobs.\n\n\"We are in discussions with the Australian government in relation to whether or not work can be found that would secure the longer-term future of the Williamstown shipyard\" in Melbourne that employs about 1,000 workers, BAE Systems Australia spokesman Simon Latimer said. The company manufactures naval ships and submarines, and current production and design work ends in 2015.\n\nForgacs has held talks with state and federal governments over \"the imminent threat to jobs and the economic impact of interruptions to the naval manufacturing pipeline\", the New South Wales state-based company said yesterday in a statement. The company is part of a team building the A$8 billion (S$9 billion) Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyers for the Australian defence force, according to its website.\n\nAustralia has long-term plans to acquire about 80 ships, from submarines to an Antarctic icebreaker, at a cost of more than A$100 billion, according to the union.\n\nBringing forward the construction of at least two navy supply ships and setting out a timetable for the design and construction of patrol boats and warships would protect jobs, Mr Thompson said.

When George Clooney talks, studio bosses listen.\n\nThe film, directed by Clooney and based on a non-fiction book by Robert M Edsel titled The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, tells the little-known story of a unit of dedicated art professionals who worked to recover, protect and return the art to its rightful owners.\n\nConsidering the Nazis spirited away an estimated five million items of plundered art during their occupation of Western Europe, the job was a monumental recovery mission. Under direct orders from the German High Command, priceless artworks from churches, cultural institutions and private homes had been removed and stashed away in various locations - the Fuhrer apparently had big plans to build an eponymous museum complex to display works by Rembrandt, Vermeer and Michelangelo, among many others. When the tide of war turns against him, Hitler issues a directive to destroy all the art.\n\n\"The very foundation of modern society is at stake,\" intones Frank Stokes (Clooney), the art historian who outlines the gravity of the situation to his superiors and then proceeds to round up a kind of art world Dirty Dozen to help retrieve the stolen works. They go through basic training, wear military uniforms and have to fire their weapons on occasion, but they are not soldiers by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nIn real life, this special Allied unit, named the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, comprised about 345 men and women from 13 nations, but the film distils them into a few distinct personalities.\n\nWith Stokes acting as a narrator of sorts the story is told in episodic form, with each person or two-man team on the trail of specific artworks, primarily a Van Eyck altarpiece from the Ghent Cathedral and a Michelangelo statue from a church in Bruges.\n\nStokes' all-star team includes James Granger (Matt Damon), a conservator who encounters Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), a Paris-based museum employee who ostensibly collaborates with the Nazis but secretly works for the Resistance, keeping meticulous records of the artworks that pass through her office.\n\nOther integral members of the group are architect Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and fellow collector Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), a British curator given a second chance after an unspecified fall from grace, and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) as the obligatory Frenchman. Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas) is a young soldier who joins the group as a German-language interpreter.\n\nThe Monuments Men is a sleuthing mission filmed in the straightforward old-school style of war films like The Guns of Navarone (1961), but while entertaining in parts, it is not entirely convincing and strangely lacking in drama. There are moments of tension as the men race to recover the art ahead of the Russians, and not everyone makes it back alive but - perhaps because Clooney intended it as such - the film has the feel of a lightweight, resembling an Ocean's Eleven caper more than a serious war movie. Still, Clooney's considerable clout got The Monuments Men made - and for that art historians everywhere should be grateful.\n\nRating: B-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The estimated deficit - which works out to 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product - blew private sector economists' projections out of the water. While they had been expecting the surplus to narrow as a result of higher social spending, none had forecast a negative balance.\n\nThe overall budget deficit factors in the new $8 billion Pioneer Generation Fund, and includes an estimated net investment returns contribution of $8.1 billion.\n\n\"This is close to a balanced budget, and will not result in a draw on past reserves as we have sufficient surpluses from the last few years,\" said Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday.\n\nFY2014 could see operating revenue rise 4.1 per cent year on year to an estimated $59.51 billion, as personal income tax collections grow 14.9 per cent to $8.79 billion. More than half of the increase would be due to the expiry of a tax rebate, which amounted to $700 million in FY2013.\n\nCorporate income tax collections are expected to increase by 3.9 per cent to $13.03 billion, in line with economic growth. Goods and services tax collections - another revenue driver - could gain 6.1 per cent to $10.11 billion, in tandem with the expansion of private consumption expenditure.\n\nOther taxes could jump 10.5 per cent to $5.82 billion, mainly driven by higher foreign worker levy collections. But tax collections are unlikely to increase on all fronts. With expectations of further cooling in the property market, the government foresees a 30 per cent plunge in stamp duties to $2.84 billion.\n\nMotor vehicle taxes are estimated to drop by 19.5 per cent to $1.36 billion, due to more rebates arising from larger numbers of vehicle de-registrations.\n\nThe operating revenue would cover an estimated $56.66 billion in total expenditure, up 8.3 per cent from the previous year, as spending on health, culture, community & youth, and national development increases. Health expenditure could jump 22.5 per cent to $7.12 billion, mainly due to higher manpower costs, as well as more grants for healthcare institutions, to cater for growth in patient subsidies.\n\nSpending for culture, community & youth could also surge 44.5 per cent to $2 billion, for projects such as the development of Tampines Town Hub.\n\nWith higher housing grants and increased spending on the Home Improvement Programme and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, national development expenditure is slated to rise by 28.4 per cent to $2 billion.\n\nSpecial transfers, excluding top-ups to endowment and trust funds, will rise to $3.61 billion in FY2014. Of this, special transfers to businesses will amount to $2.8 billion, to help companies restructure.\n\nNotably, top-ups to endowment and trust funds will hit $8.5 billion in FY2014, far surpassing FY2013's $5.59 billion. The bulk of this increase is driven by the Pioneer Generation Fund; a further $0.5 billion top-up to the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will also be made.\n\nIn setting aside $8 billion in Budget 2014 to create the Pioneer Generation Fund, the government \"is (ensuring) that Budgets in subsequent years can focus on the needs and challenges of the future\", said Mr Tharman, citing future spending needs in infrastructure, healthcare and education.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government will continue to monitor the property market in the coming quarters and adjust our measures when necessary.\n\n\"We are not engineering a hard landing. But neither are we able to eliminate cycles in the property market, with upswings in prices in some years followed by corrections.\"\n\nProperty industry players had called for a scaleback of the seven rounds of property cooling since 2009, which rolled out measures such as the seller's stamp duty (to discourage short-term trading in property), additional buyer's stamp duty (targeting property investors and foreign buyers) and lower loan-to-value limits for those taking their second or subsequent home mortgages.\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Homes CEO Cheang Kok Kheong said last night: \"I guess they will let the measures run for a couple more quarters before deciding what to do. Right now, the market still has depth. People are still investing. The economy's doing well and there's liquidity.\"\n\nThe group has collected 585 cheques for its 495-unit Rivertrees Residences condo in Sengkang, where sales begin today. The average price is $1,050 psf, compared with slightly over $1,000 psf for the next-door Riverbank@Fernvale released last week.\n\nChesterton Singapore managing director Donald Han reckons it will take a few consecutive quarters of price contractions before the government scales back cooling measures. The official private home price index has posted only its first quarter-on-quarter drop, of 0.9 per cent, in Q4 2013 since Q1 2012.\n\nThe Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore said it \"noted that the government is not engineering a hard landing and will continue to monitor the property market and adjust the cooling measures when necessary\".\n\nAddressing the issue of rising rentals for businesses, Mr Tharman noted that \"a very large quantity of industrial and shop space is entering the market, and should have a moderating influence over the next few years\".\n\nNew industrial spaces clustering companies within the same industry will also help SMEs reduce costs through consolidating operations, pooling resources and aggregating demand for delivery and other services.\n\n\"For instance, JTC's Food Hub concept will feature an integrated cold room-warehouse shared facility operated by a third party provider who will also provide logistics services. This will not only lower the capital investments needed by SMEs - as they no longer need to invest in their own cold rooms - but also enable them to benefit from more efficient supply chains,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nSingapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry said: \"We are glad that government agencies like JTC and HDB are taking steps to create a pipeline of industrial/commercial space for business. We would hope that some of this space could be extended to SMEs at an affordable rate.\"\n\nTo encourage businesses to maximise land use, the Land Intensification Allowance (LIA), due to expire next year, will be renewed for five years to June 30, 2020. The scheme will also be extended to the logistics sector and businesses carrying out qualifying activities on airport and port land. \"When you look at these three new areas joining the LIA scheme, you can see the government's ambition to enhance Singapore's competitiveness as a regional transportation hub,\" said KPMG tax partner Gan Kwee Lian.\n\nIntroduced in Budget 2010 to promote industrial land productivity and higher value-added activities, it allows companies to claim for capital expenditure incurred to construct a qualifying building or structure over 15 years.\n\nFrom today, the government is streamlining the stamp duty rate structure. Tang Woon Ee, partner, Rodyk & Davidson, said this has only a marginal impact on the amount of stamp duty payable for property purchases, share transfers and mortgage instruments.\n\nAs for property leases, there are stamp duty savings for short-term leases of under a year. However, for leases that are over two years but not exceeding three years, there is a significant increase in stamp duty payable. For instance, a three-year lease for an apartment at $3,000 monthly rent attracts $432 stamp duty - 50 per cent more than the $288 under the old system. \"Leases beyond three years do not seem to have much difference in stamp duty payable,\" she added.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance noted that currently the stamp duty on a property lease is assessed on the annualised rental amount, regardless of the actual lease period. This means that a one-month lease will bear the same stamp duty amount as a one-year lease, where the monthly rent is the same for both leases. \"To ensure consistency in stamp duty treatment across leases of varying tenures\", leases up to four years will attract stamp duty of 0.4 per cent of the total rent for the entire lease period. For leases exceeding four years or for any indefinite term, the stamp duty rate is 0.4 per cent of four times the average annual rent for the entire lease period.\n\nLeung Yew Kwong, principal tax consultant at KMPG, said: \"The new system uses a percentage of the consideration eg rent or purchase price, which simplifies the computation, whereas the old system was a more complicated way of counting. In fact, many people were already using a decimal system for ease of calculation.\"\n\nFor the Approved Building Project Scheme, a review date, March 31, 2017, has been set. The scheme accords exemption from property tax on land under development, for up to three years, to big industrial building projects supported by the EDB. Typically such projects involve spending of at least $500 million (excluding land costs).\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Rather, said Mr Lee, they want \"different and unique experiences\" that are customised to their interests.\n\n\"We have to complement our hardware with good software, to create an unforgettable experience which makes you want to come back for more visits,\" he told the 300 guests in attendance at the event.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Lee called on companies to play their part by providing more interesting and varied options to cater to discerning travellers, while workers have to deliver a higher level of service to meet greater expectations.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, will support these efforts fully, the prime minister said. Nearly $1 billion has been injected into a Tourism Development Fund to develop new tourism concepts, pay for new leisure and business events and upgrade the industry as a whole.\n\nBut tourism is not only about money, said Mr Lee, stressing that the human touch is just as important.\n\n\"Tourism is a high-touch industry. Although technology can help overcome our manpower constraints, it can never fully replace the warmth of people-to-people interaction,\" he said.\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Trade and Industry was already looking into how the government could do more to give workers here the necessary \"skills, knowledge, graces and courtesies\" to do well in the sector.\n\n\"Fun is serious business in Singapore. I encourage companies and workers to join us on this shared endeavour, and take full advantage of our schemes to transform our tourism landscape,\" he said.\n\nLater in the day, Mr Lee and his wife Ho Ching spent time touring the River Safari, the fourth park under the Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) group.\n\nThey were joined by other VIPs including Minister in the Prime Minister's Office S Iswaran, Singapore Tourism Board chief Lionel Yeo, WRS chairman Claire Chiang and several diplomats.\n\nThe $160 million attraction in Mandai is home to Singapore's two giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. To date, more than 1.1 million people have visited the 12 ha park, which features 6,000 different animal specimens.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Natalie Koh\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTRAVELLERS seeking out the traditional Thai holiday experience needn't look further than Anantara Phuket Villas, a luxury Phuket resort with the ubiquitous thatch-roofed villas and sprawling lily pond that stretches from the lobby right to the hotel restaurant.\n\nThat sense of exotica is noticeably absent in its new sister property across the road - Anatara Vacation Club - with its contemporary villas and apartment block that project a more cosmopolitan, family-oriented image compared to its more genteel older sibling. The difference, explains general manager Lyndon Ellis of the Bangkok-based hotel group, is that each property caters to a different demographic. \"Europeans come into Thailand and they love the Thai houses and architecture, but when Asians come here, they want more contemporary facilities,\" says Mr Ellis. \"Most of the owners - nearly 20 per cent - are Chinese nationals, followed by the Thai at 16 per cent, and the rest are mostly made up of people from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.\"\n\nHe says \"owners\" because Anantara Vacation Club operates on a timeshare concept, where buyers commit to purchasing a certain number of points each year for 30 years, which can be used to redeem a certain number of days at the vacation club. Notwithstanding the dubious reputation of timeshare properties in the early days (thanks to a number of scams linked to it), the timeshare concept has slowly but surely gained popularity in recent years. \"The credibility of vacation clubs and timeshares has definitely gotten a lot better,\" Mr Ellis notes. \"If you sit down and do the numbers, you realise that buying a timeshare has greater value than staying at a hotel if you come to Phuket on a yearly basis.\"\n\nSince the owners return every year, Anantara Vacation Club makes it a point to make their villas and apartments as family-friendly as possible. For instance, each villa and apartment suites come with living and dining rooms, washers and an equipped kitchen, full with crockery and cookware, so it feels a lot more like a home than a hotel stay.\n\nEven their in-house activities are rather, shall we say, domestic. For instance, there are Thai cooking lessons over at the hotel restaurant, Chaam, and a Kids' Club that will keep children well entertained through the day.\n\nFor the less domestic-inclined, there's plenty to do outside the vacation club, such as a boat ride out to the famous James Bond Island, which was featured in 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun; a bicycle tour through a coconut and rubber plantation; or a jaunt across the road to Turtle Village, a small shopping centre with a handful of eateries, souvenir shops and luxury brand outlets.\n\nYou could also opt for a car ride out to Mai Khao beach, which, unlike the famed Patong beach further south of the island, is a quiet stretch of sand devoid of pesky hawkers and booming beach bars. In fact, our cycling guides share that speed boats and road vendors aren't allowed at Mai Khao - not because of any law or regulation, but because the locals are adamant about keeping the beach from transforming into a second Patong.\n\n\"If you built a restaurant or bar on the beach tonight, it wouldn't be the police stopping you, it'd be the locals coming over and telling you off,\" Mr Ellis laughs. \"They've sold the land, but they still live here, and they want to keep it clean, simple and non-commercial.\"\n\nIn keeping with the Anantara philosophy of offering up an authentic Thai experience, Mr Ellis adds that there's plenty of Thai-ness in the service and hospitality of Anantara Vacation Club to make up for the lack of traditional Thai architecture. For instance, he shares that the staff always tries to give guests a story to go home with. \"It could be something small that our housekeeper does for our guests,\" he says. \"Like if an employee hears a guest say in passing: 'I really miss hamburgers' or if they're homesick for something, we'll get them that and leave it in their room with a note.\"\n\nOf course, that's not always feasible. But don't be surprised if you return from a long day out in the Phuket sun to find a dainty slice of pandan cake laid out nicely on a plate on your dinner table.\n\nIt's all just part of the warm, welcoming Thai hospitality that Thailand is so known for, and which Anantara has become so adept at providing - that even with a more up-tempo, contemporary design, Anantara Vacation Club manages to bring out the distinct Thai flavour - and make you feel right at home at the same time.\n\nbtnews@sph.com.sg\n\nThe writer was a guest of Anantara Vacation Club\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This came on the back of stronger revenue and revaluation gains on its investment properties.\n\nRevenue for last year rose 11.5 per cent to $183.97 million, as the increase in contributions from the hotel and industrial divisions partly offset lower contributions from the property-rental and investment division.\n\nRevaluation gains from investment properties leapt more than four-fold to $35.75 million from $8.4 million.\n\nThis bolstered the group's \"other income including interest income\" to $39.4 million, which was more than three times 2012's $12.14 million.\n\nEarnings per share for fiscal 2013 were 13.981 cents, up from 6.111 cents in 2012.\n\nBonvests said in its financial statement yesterday: \"The property rental market in Singapore and Tunis is expected to remain stable in the near term.\"\n\nIt added that there was less predictability in its other business divisions.\n\nThe hotel division is operating in countries where market conditions are expected to remain challenging, while the industrial division will continue to face competitive market conditions, Bonvests said.\n\n\"The performance of the investment division will continue to be affected by volatility of the various stock markets.\"\n\nThe group has awarded the tender to construct its second Maldives hotel. It has also called a tender for the construction of its hotel in Bintan; the evaluation is now underway.\n\nBonvests has declared a first and final dividend of 1.5 cents in cash, higher than the 1.2 cents declared for fiscal 2012. The proposed dividend is expected to be paid on May 20.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It extended by 10 years the additional tax deductions of 50 per cent that firms currently enjoy on qualifying research and development spending, until 2025. Further deductions administered by the Economic and Development Board currently will also go on for an additional five years, until 2020.\n\nA five-year extension was also made on the writing down allowance for cost incurred to acquire qualifying intellectual property rights, until 2020.\n\nSaid Mr Tharman: \"We will aggressively support every form of upgrading by firms - whether through R&D, automating business processes, creating new design and brands, or enriching the skills of their employees.\"\n\nSMEs and market watchers welcomed the extensions to the government's tax incentives, saying that it will help firms in their restructuring efforts.\n\nIn particular, many welcomed the SME-focused PIC+ scheme and the extension of the PIC.\n\nOng Jun Quan, executive director at Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering, said that the subcontractor will \"definitely benefit\" from it. \"We have been using the PIC and usually, we opt for the tax claims. The higher expenditure cap is good for us because our machines to raise productivity can each cost $300,000 or more.\"\n\nThe higher cap, therefore, means that Soon Li Heng can enjoy more tax deductions, he added.\n\nEng Soon Dry Bean Curd Manufacturing's production manager, Tan Jun Long, said that the extension of the PIC, and the introduction of the PIC+, gives SMEs the time needed to automate their processes and raise efficiency levels.\n\nThe small firm, which made $4.43 million in sales last year, had used the PIC previously to purchase a package machine, and has intentions to further automate its processes.\n\n\"As an SME, we might take a while to automate so this extension of the PIC, and the new PIC+, gives us the time needed to do that,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nStart-up T-Ware also lauded the PIC extension and the PIC+. Said CEO James Teh: \"In general, we have benefited from the PIC. The extensions to the additional tax deductions on R&D are also great for companies like ours that are very R&D based.\"\n\nT-Ware produces a coat called the T.Jacket which simulates the feeling of a cuddle, and has a practical application in helping children with autism.\n\nLennon Lee, corporate tax partner at PwC Singapore, said: \"It is heartening to know that the Singapore government introduced a PIC+ targeted only at Singapore SMEs, who are the ones that need help to transform and to increase productivity.\"\n\nThe move to extend the PIC by three years is also welcomed, but the government needs to look at how to better administer the scheme, said Tay Hong Beng, head of tax at KPMG in Singapore.\n\n\"With the extension and enhancement of the PIC scheme, it is now time to look at the administration of the incentive. We ought to adopt a principle-based approach and move away from prescriptive rules so that more businesses spending on genuine productivity initiatives can access the benefits easily,\" he said.\n\nKurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME), noted that numerous pro-SME initiatives like the PIC+ were announced, but added that they are all targeted at helping profitable SMEs.\n\n\"This Budget is geared towards performing SMEs. Those that are struggling and barely profitable would not benefit very much. In fact, there were no measures to help struggling SMEs.\n\n\"That said, this is a very SME-centric Budget. The focus was on SMEs, and not on MNCs (multinational corporations).\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Close to 300 units will be launched in the initial phase for the 495-unit project that is jointly developed by Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Orchard and Sekisui House.\n\nThe average pricing for the initial phase is said to be in the range of $950-1,150 per square foot (psf). Frasers Centrepoint had said that the units will be sold at a premium of $50-100 psf to its next-door competing project, Riverbank @ Fernvale by UOL Development.\n\nAlready, UOL has moved at least 210 units out of 250 units launched at Riverbank @ Fernvale, where sales began one week back at an average price of slightly above $1,000 psf. Both projects are nestled in the north-east region earmarked under the Draft Master Plan as a new centre for growth.\n\nThe Rivertrees Residence project comprises a mix of one and two-bedroom suites, three and four-bedroom units, \"trio homes\" that have dual-key and inter-generation designs, as well as \"prive homes\" that come with private lift lobbies. Prices of the two-bedroom suites start from $618,000, according to Frasers Centrepoint.\n\nThere are also eight duplex three-bedroom strata-titled landed homes - called \"cove houses\" - selling for under $2 million, for which permanent residents need to obtain approval from the Land Dealings Unit under the Singapore Land Authority to qualify.\n\nThe Frasers Centrepoint-led consortium paid $533 psf for Rivertrees' 99-year leasehold site in June last year, a shade higher than UOL's $489 psf for the Riverbank site in April last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue gained 5.9 per cent to $170.4 million during the quarter, representing a 0.5 percentage point improvement in net profit margin to 5.5 per cent.\n\nNet profit for the full 2013 slipped 6.6 per cent to $38.9 million, or 2.81 cents per share. This was after taking into consideration Q1 2012's non-core items - a one-time disposal gain of $10.5 million arising from the sale of an old warehouse and an under- provision of prior year's tax amounting to $1.6 million. Excluding those items, 2013 profit would have been 18.6 per cent higher.\n\nMarket expectations were for full-year net profit of $39.1 million, according to a poll of six brokers by Bloomberg.\n\nSheng Siong is proposing a final cash dividend of 1.4 cents per share, about 20 per cent below its payout of 1.75 cents per share for the previous year. The stock closed flat at 60 cents yesterday.\n\nDBS analyst Alfie Yeo said costs will be a critical variable in 2014.\n\n\"Costs and rental have been creeping up, so you should look out for this in the coming year,\" Mr Yeo said. \"The trend is that it is getting more challenging to find good locations at reasonable rental rates.\"\n\nSheng Siong said it did not open any new outlets in 2013 because of a lack of suitable retail space, and total retail area remained constant at 400,000 square feet.\n\n\"The plan to open new stores in areas where the group does not have a presence could be hampered if suitable retail space cannot be found,\" Sheng Siong said.\n\nExcluding three stores opened in 2011 and eight stores opened in 2012, comparable same-store sales declined by 2 per cent in 2013 mainly because of nearby construction work at the Bedok Central and the Verge stores. Excluding those affected stores, same-store sales would have been \"marginally flat\" for 2013, Sheng Siong said.\n\nThe fourth quarter actually had a slightly positive tone, with same-store sales excluding Bedok Central and the Verge gaining by 2 per cent in the fourth quarter. \"The recovery in comparable same-store sales took place gradually throughout FY2013 as a result of new sales and marketing initiatives and renovations to two stores,\" Sheng Siong said.\n\nBut the year ahead is expected to remain competitive.\n\n\"There were not many new supermarket outlets serving the mass market opened by the competitors in 2013 and the focus of industry could be improving same-store sales in 2014,\" Sheng Siong said.\n\n\"Besides competitive pressures, gross margin would be affected if input cost is increased because of food inflation, which could be caused by disruption to the supply chain. The government's restriction on the supply of foreign labour, and the impending increase in foreign workers' levy would put upward pressure on manpower cost and increase operating expenses.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The stylised violence of 300 (2007) put the genre back in vogue and now with Pompeii, filmmakers are betting that barechested men in leather skirts will cause more sparks to fly at the box office.\n\nAs insurance, they cast Kit Harington, the hunky heartthrob from cable TV's Game of Thrones, in the lead role and in the hope that a similar wardrobe will keep the momentum going. They needn't have worried too much: the raven-haired actor spends most of Pompeii looking like he may simply have gotten lost on his way to the Thrones set.\n\nHis acting career is on the rise but Harington comes in a distant second to the, um, explosive star of Pompeii: Mount Vesuvius, whose historic eruption (in 3D, no less) is convincing enough to score a recurring role in any number of National Geographic specials.\n\nIndeed, Pompeii has the look and feel of a well-produced television drama. While decent special effects of a famous volcano spewing ash clouds, toxic fumes and molten magma into the sky and so-so scenes of gladiators in bloody action at the local amphitheatre don't do much to enhance the movie's narrative, it's really the love story between the gladiator slave Milo (Harington) and Cassia (Emily Browning), the daughter of a wealthy Pompeii businessman (Jared Harris), that is a big letdown.\n\nThe poorly developed romance, which stems from Milo's skill at handling horses and Cassia's ability to bat her eyelashes at the unsalaried help - coupled with her determination to escape the clutches of the leering Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) - is about as believable as the corny dialogue: \"He made me feel safe,\" gushes Cassia in full swoon mode after a breathless canter in the countryside with Milo.\n\nThe relationship between Milo and fellow gladiator Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is slightly more palatable. They start off as potential adversaries but inevitably join forces against the bad guys. On a fateful day in 79 AD, they are scheduled by the Romans to fight each other to the death, but nature has other plans. The showdown, when it does come, is between Milo and his nemesis, and it is only too predictable.\n\nThe big problem with Pompeii, directed by Paul WS Anderson and written by Jane Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler and Michael Robert Johnson, is that everything was handled much better in Gladiator which - had it featured an erupting volcano - would have made this new film fully redundant.\n\nThe fate of the poor citizens of Pompeii is forever recorded in the history books and in the letters of Pliny the Younger, the lawmaker who witnessed the eruption from across the Bay of Naples. The fate of Pompeii the movie is destined to be somewhat less drastic - buried under a mountain of indifference instead.\n\nRating: C\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the light of present-day reality, this may be the best outcome.\"\n\nAgreeing, Thomas Lee, a lawyer and SICC member, said: \"This latest position is actually a reprieve.\n\n\"Of course, I'd prefer that nothing is taken away, but since the decision is already made, I guess we'll just have to live with it.\"\n\nNevertheless, Mr Tay expressed disappointment that the outcome fell short of what the committee had sought.\n\n\"With the loss of one of our courses, it will put a strain on our remaining facilities, given our large membership base. That strain will be felt more starkly post-2030, when the club will have only one leasehold location to operate from.\"\n\nHe highlighted the fact that the extension for the course next to the public one was conditional on the club reaching an agreement with the labour movement, by February next year, on reconfiguring the golf courses and the sharing of facilities; otherwise, the club would lose the entire location in 2021.\n\nGolf club membership broker Fion Phua said that this scared some members into selling their memberships yesterday morning, which could also add to pressure on the price of an SICC membership. It has already fallen about $15,000 in three days to between $190,000 and $200,000, she noted.\n\nMeanwhile, rising membership prices at other golf courses have triggered enquiries from enterprising foreigners - especially Koreans and Chinese nationals - who are buying Malaysian golf club memberships with a view to sell them to Singaporeans in future.\n\nMs Phua said: \"(They are asking:) 'When Singapore clubs eventually become too congested, will that be a good investment?'\"\n\nThe closure of the Marina Bay Golf Course, Keppel Club and Orchid Country Club by 2030 is set to cut 200 ha from the current 1,500 ha of golf club land.\n\nSingaporeans are, however, wary about Malaysian golf courses because of the crime rate in Johor Bahru, brokers said.\n\nHenry Yip, a golf club broker, said: \"At this moment, there's still this sentiment of not wanting to risk an arm and a leg just trying to go into JB, although I'm hearing from affected family and friends that they might look more at playing there in future.\"\n\nWith the dust settled and greater certainty on the horizon, golf clubs are now moving ahead with their plans which had been put on hold.\n\nTanah Merah Country Club yesterday told its members that it plans to extensively renovate its Tampines course. The club is now waiting for details on the terms of the new lease before proceeding.\n\nRaffles Country Club, unaffected by the latest review, has also obtained approval from its members to proceed with an upgrade of its 18-hole Palm course.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This reflected the timing of projects completed during the year, Hyflux said. For fiscal 2013, the municipal sector continued to be the main contributor, with Asia ex-China accounting for 87 per cent of revenue. China accounted for 9 per cent while the Middle East and North Africa made up the remaining 4 per cent.\n\nLower direct costs and staff costs, due to the completion of some of the group's projects, led to a 16 per cent drop in total operating and finance expenses to $489 million from $583.2 million.\n\nBut finance costs rose because of higher borrowings to fund the group's water projects. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs also climbed on the back of impairments and write-downs of the carrying value of non-core business and technology-related assets.\n\nThe board of directors proposed a final dividend of 1.60 Singapore cents per ordinary share. This is in addition to an interim dividend of 0.70 Singapore cent per ordinary share that was paid out in September 2013.\n\n\"Despite 2013 being another difficult year, we managed to turn in a creditable performance. We saw the commissioning of Tuaspring Desalination Plant in Singapore as well as a portfolio of smaller projects in the region which were completed within very tight timelines. Some of these plants have started contributing to our recurring income base, which will augment our EPC income streams,\" Hyflux's executive chairman and Group CEO, Olivia Lum, said.\n\nThe Tuaspring plant went on-stream last September. Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) works on the on-site power plant are progressing as planned, with its operational readiness dependent on the completion of the connection to the national power grid.\n\nAs at Dec 31, the group's order book stood at $2.67 billion, with $732 million worth of EPC contracts and $1.9 billion from operations and maintenance.\n\nHyflux shares closed unchanged yesterday at $1.24.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE must be something about the air in Colorado. On a visit last autumn, nearly everyone we met came to Colorado for some reason or another, fell in love with the state and decided not to leave. The exception was our coach driver, who proudly declared, \"I was born and grew up in Denver, a Denver Broncos fan all the way,\" referring to the football team.\n\nIt's not hard to see why people have chosen to uproot themselves to live in one of the four states that make up the heart of the American Southwest. New Mexico, Utah and Arizona make up the remaining three.\n\nThe eighth biggest state in the United States, it is known for its varied geography, from arid plains and deserts, to granite rock formations, and lush forests. It is also home to Independence Pass, which is the highest paved pass in North America, at 3,687m above sea level. The Rocky Mountains run down the middle of the state, and to top it off, Colorado promises 300 days of sunshine annually.\n\nFor international travellers, Denver, the state capital, is often the entry and exit point out of the state. At one mile or 1,609m above sea level, it's one of the highest major American cities, hence its Mile High City nickname. A night or two is sufficient to get a feel of Denver, you want to save yourself for the more fun stuff outside Denver.\n\nThe city is compact and the best way around is on foot, although there is a bicycle-sharing system. Pay US$8 for a 24-hour membership, and you can pick up and drop off bicycles across town. Or if you are at the 16th Street Mall, the mile-long pedestrian promenade lined with cafes and shops, there is a free shuttle bus that takes shoppers up and down the street.\n\nDenver runs a fairly known public art programme, where 1 per cent of public funds used for building construction must be set aside for public art. Don't miss the quirky works which include a 12m tall sculpture of a blue bear that peers into the Colorado Convention Center, which has become a city icon. Walk past the drainage holes along Curtis Street, and you may hear the sound of a train or the flush of a toilet. Don't worry, it is only part of a sound installation. And if you do make it to the Denver Art Museum, which has an extensive collection of Native American art, do make a stop at the bathrooms. American artist Jim Green makes the sinks sing, through hidden speakers.\n\nNapa Valley of beer\n\nBeer brewing is big in Colorado: in 2010, it ranked first in the nation in gross beer production, earning itself the nickname as the Napa valley of beer. A night out could start with craft beer sampling at the Denver Beer Co, which first started as a home brewery in 2011, but is now the place to go for a pint.\n\nDenver has always been known for its steakhouses, not only beef, but also bison. But the culinary scene is more than that. Denver's best-known chef has got to be Jennifer Jasinski, who won the Best Chef Southwest medal at the James Beard Foundation Awards, known as the Oscars of the American food industry. Her Rioja restaurant is Mediterranean-inspired, and the pan roasted Petaluma chicken with jalepeno-corn bread pudding and crispy chicken skin chips is a crowd favourite.\n\nColorado's biggest attraction has to be Aspen. It is hard to imagine that the town only got its reputation as a ski destination from the 1940s, when Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort. The former silver mining town, so named because of the abundance of aspen trees in the area, boomed during the 1880s, but fell into decline when the silver market collapsed.\n\nSki season in Aspen runs from late November to April, with four mountains to choose from. Locals and experts head to Aspen Mountain for its steep glades and bump-runs, big-mountain enthusiasts gravitate towards Aspen Highlands because of the challenging terrain, beginners tend to start off at Buttermilk and families love Snowmass.\n\nBut even if you don't ski or snowboard, it is worth a gondola ride up to Aspen Mountain to soak in the sights, and stay warm with a cup of hot chocolate.\n\nOutside of ski season, other outdoor activities include going on road and mountain biking trails, fly fishing, and horseback riding. The town also prides itself on its vibrant arts and culture scene, so much so, that locals say Aspen brings the arts and culture of the big city to visitors sans the honking horns. Key events on the calendar include the Aspen Ideas Festival, a gathering of some of the brightest and most innovative minds in the world, Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, Jazz Aspen Snowmass, and the annual Aspen Santa Fe Ballet.\n\nThe town is friendly for all seasons, but you may want to skip the low season from mid-October to mid-November. Shops and restaurants are known to be open one day, and suddenly close the next till ski season begins.\n\nWhile the town of Aspen is world renowned, neighbouring town Breckenridge has plenty of charm too. Gold miners used to flock to this town, but today, the town has been taken over by outdoor lovers. Skiers take their pick from four peaks which vary in difficulty. Non-skiers may find delight in going dog-sledding or riding snowmobiles through the forests.\n\nA local saying goes: \"We came for the winter and stayed for the summer.\" Non-wintry activities include whitewater rafting, hot-air balloon rides, and biking. You can do similar stuff at Aspen, but we hear its much cheaper to do so in Breckenridge.\n\nMountains aside, Colorado is home to some amazing rock formations. One of which is Red Rocks Amphitheatre. This 9,000-seat arena was carved out of massive red sandstone rocks, creating the only naturally occurring, acoustically perfect amphitheatre in the world. Red Rocks has played host to The Beatles who played here during their first US concert in 1964, to other big names such as Sting and U2.\n\nOutdoorsy bounty\n\nEven on non-concert days, Red Rocks is a hotspot for fitness fanatics who burn calories running up and down the 69 rows of benches, at 1,950m above sea level.\n\nAnother attraction for the geologically inclined is the Gardens of the Gods Park, which has been voted the #3 park in the world by TripAdvisor users. The 535ha\n\npark has 91m-tall towering sandstone rock formations. Hiking can be done in the park, as well as rock-climbing. For those less inclined to walk, there are guided jeep and Segway tours.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Olympics, there is also the US Olympic Training Centre to check out. Daily tours are available, giving you a peep at where 200 athletes from the fields of swimming, gymnastics and fencing, among others, train. The souvenir shop doesn't allow you to buy a gold medal, but hey, you can buy some cool Team USA merchandise.\n\nSo if you tire of going to the West and East coasts of the United States, perhaps it is time to consider heading inland. Just remember to pack your trainers and plenty of outdoor gear.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nFor booking or more information, contact Chan Brothers Travel at 6212 9684, New Shan Travel at 6546 7333 or Scenic Travel at 6226 3611.

When handed to fine actors who understand the words and deliver them with all the requisite nuances, the meaning registers instantly for the audience. Unfortunately, not many local Shakespearean productions have succeeded in doing so. In fact, you can count on your fingers the number of Singapore-born actors who can speak Shakespeare effortlessly.\n\nThe young cast in the current production of Romeo and Juliet by Toy Factory Productions is struggling - and I do mean struggling - under the weight of the language. The cast is so young that even the oldest characters like the Friar, Nurse and Lord Capulet are played by baby-faced actors in their 20s and 30s. Each actor seems to have invented his or her way of coping with the Bard's daunting verse, but these vary so from each other that the actors seem to be in different plays.\n\nBenjamin Kheng as Romeo intones every line with the same unvaried breathy romanticism. Ethel Yap as Juliet is far better at emoting, but her performance swings manically from one spurt of romantic anguish to the next. (Someone needs to sit down with the couple and plot a proper character development chart.)\n\nThe more experienced actors do a better job. Josephine Tan, as the Nurse, gives a performance that's heavy on indication and slapstick - but at least she is understood and gets the requisite laughs. Caleb Goh, as Lord Capulet, speaks Shakespeare most capably among the cast, but looks somewhat young to be the father. The other performances range from passable to downright disastrous.\n\nIs it any wonder then that the play's most entertaining parts are the verses that have been set to music by the indispensable Elaine Chan, Singapore theatre's favourite music composer? Here is where the actors, some of whom are also trained singers, show off their lungs - and, in most cases, do so well.\n\nDirector Nell Ng is clearly not versed in Shakespeare, but she does a fine job of moving the action efficiently along towards the lovers' tragic deaths.\n\nHer one massive miscalculation, however, is to conclude the play with a medley of the songs that Chan composed. What this means is that Romeo and Juliet must now bizarrely rise from the dead so they can sing songs! Now it may be quite acceptable to direct it that way for Shakespeare's comedies - but certainly not for the tragedies.\n\nToy Factory Productions' 'Romeo and Juliet' is on at the Drama Centre Theatre from now to Feb 23 at 8pm, with Tue to Sun matinees at 3.30pm.

The increases in workers' contributions will be made into the Ordinary Account as, according to Mr Tharman, some of them may still be servicing mortgages.\n\nThese changes will take effect from next January - which is also usually the month when bosses hand out yearly bonuses and salary increments - to give employers enough time to factor them into their business plans.\n\nMr Tharman also said that the government would at the same time help employers manage the CPF rate hikes.\n\nFor the increase in contributions that go into the Medisave Account, employers will get a 50 per cent offset through a one-year Temporary Employment Credit (TEC). This works out to an offset of half a point of wages, up to the CPF salary ceiling of $5,000.\n\nThe TEC will cost the government $330 million, according to Mr Tharman.\n\nFor the increase in CPF contributions to older workers, the government will give employers a one-year increase in the Special Employment Credit (SEC) of up to half a point.\n\nMr Tharman said that this temporary increase, which would cost the government an additional $30 million, comes on top of the existing SEC of up to 8 per cent of wages and would offset the increase in contribution rates for older workers.\n\nMark Whatley, a director at Towers Watson South-east Asia, a compensation consultancy, said that the overall impact of the CPF increases would depend on the age and salary profile of each employer.\n\n\"For most employers, the one percentage point across-the- board increase will likely be more significant than the additional contribution for older workers,\" he said.\n\nBut DBS senior economist Irvin Seah warned that the \"relatively larger\" hike in the employers' CPF contribution rate could hurt the jobs of elderly workers.\n\n\"This warrant some attention especially given that the number of unemployed older workers (above 50 years old) has been rising despite the labour crunch,\" he said.\n\nThe Singapore National Employers' Federation was \"pleased\" with the assurance that the government would not raise the employer's CPF rate beyond 17 per cent anytime soon.\n\nWhile noting that operating costs had risen, it said that the one-year advance notice given to increase the CPF rate \"will give adequate time for employers to make any necessary adjustments\".\n\nDiana Chia, president of the National Trades Union Congress, was \"heartened\" that the government heeded its call for the CPF hikes - and she hoped that the government \"will at some stage\" review the existing CPF rates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its property development segment recorded lower revenue, but the highest pre-tax profit among the three segments.\n\nA first and final dividend of 0.8 cent a share was declared. This translates to a dividend yield of 3 per cent based on BBR's closing price of 26.5 cents yesterday and a dividend payout ratio of 11 per cent out of 2013's earnings.\n\nThe 2013 dividend was down from 1.2 cents a share in 2012 - 0.8 cent a share in ordinary dividends and a special dividend of 0.4 cent a share.\n\nEarnings per share for 2013 were 7.13 cents, up from 4.24 cents a year ago.\n\nNet asset value per share stood at 40.98 cents at end-2013.\n\nThe company did not disclose its fourth-quarter results.\n\nCEO Andrew Tan said the company's order book is now at $905 million, comprising mainly civil engineering and building projects in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n\"We strive to maintain our competitive edge through enhancing our technology, cost effectiveness and greater efficiency in project management,\" he said.\n\nThe company said the outlook for the construction industry is expected to be challenging because of slowing sector growth, increasing competition and higher labour costs caused by foreign-worker shortages.\n\nBBR said it will continue to focus on its core business, and continue to conduct feasibility studies to undertake new property development projects.\n\nIt is currently working on public and private projects in Singapore and Malaysia such as a $179 million contract from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to build 17 blocks of 1,386 new homes in Pasir Ris, due to be completed in the second half of this year. It is also developing two condominium projects.\n\nBBR ended one cent higher at 26.5 cents yesterday, before results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They will range from studio flats to five-bedroom penthouses.\n\nThe practice of selling to overseas buyers before completion has been favoured by housebuilders as a way to help to finance developments and reduce the risk of being left with unsold flats.\n\nLate last year, however, 11 housebuilders signed a commitment to sell homes in new developments in Britain before or at the same time as trying to sell them outside the country.\n\n\"There has been a lot of comment recently about London's housing problems,\" said Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company. \"We are proud to be launching these new homes in London only, and this decision is part of a wider strategy to create a product well-suited for owner occupiers and people who will help us create a real and lasting community here in Battersea.\"\n\nThe developer started selling homes at the power station site last year in a first phase of 835 flats, 55 per cent of which were sold abroad in countries such as Malaysia, Russia and China. The site will contain 3,500 homes when it is completed in 15 years.\n\nForeign investors have bought about 70 per cent of new-build homes across central London, according to Savills, helping to fuel a 10 per cent rise in prices last year and stoking resentment among locals trying to get a foot on the property ladder.\n\nThe Malaysian consortium, which includes developer SP Setia, Sime Darby and a subsidiary controlled by the Employees Provident Fund pension fund, bought the power station for \u00a3400 million (S$843 million), beating rival bidders from as far afield as Brazil, China and Kazakhstan. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The contrast is particularly obvious in a series of portraits that depict Mr Lee with his finger pointed upwards or towards the viewer. Depending on his expression, he could be dispensing advice or squaring off against an opponent.\n\nThe dilute paint that's allowed to run down the canvas create a deliberate sense of \"untidiness\" and enigma to the portraits, which appear never complete or perfect.\n\nThis unusual approach to depicting Mr Lee is deliberate on the part of its well-known artist Boo Sze Yang. He wanted to convey the many facets of Mr Lee's public persona - as well as his own ambivalent feelings about the politician.\n\nDifferent opinions\n\nHe says: \"I was born in 1965, the year Singapore gained independence. For 48 years, I've witnessed Mr Lee shape the country into the cosmopolitan city it is today. I've heard all sorts of opinions given of the man - both good and bad. But who is he, really?... We may never know because we rely on secondary information to tell us.\"\n\nBoo, 48, is one of Singapore's best-known mid-career artists. He has won the the Juror's Choice for the Philip Morris Singapore-Asean Art Award in 2003, and the Platinum Award, UOB Painting of the Year Competition in 2009. His works are collected by the Singapore Art Museum, the Singapore Istana and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore.\n\nHe has turned his brush on landscapes and objects - but never people. His series of portraits of Mr Lee, titled The Father, represents his 14th solo exhibition and his first attempt at capturing a famous personality.\n\nOver the years, other artists like Tan Swie Hian, Jimmy Ong, Ong Hui Har and Sukeshi Sondhi have attempted to capture Mr Lee on canvas. These attempts have ranged from the solemn and deferential to the outright irreverent. When curators Valentine Willie and Jason Wee held the Singapore Survey: Beyond LKY exhibition in 2010, for instance, several works looked deeply into - and questioned - Mr Lee's cult of personality.\n\nBoo's paintings are notable for their sense of anxiety - the notion that Mr Lee doesn't just inspire respect and admiration but also fear and uncertainty. The jabbing brush strokes, staccato rhythms and trickling paint - all hallmarks of Boo's style - evoke a broad range of emotions in the viewer.\n\nThe works are priced from $9,000 for a 1.2m by 1.2m portrait, to $45,000 for a 2m by 4.5m triptych.\n\nIntrospective twist\n\nOne particularly effective work depicts seven images of Mr Lee at seven different ages seated around a table and talking to one another. The painting resembles Leonardo Da Vinci's famous The Last Supper, but with an unexpected introspective twist.\n\nBoo says: \"I was trying to capture what it might be like to be Mr Lee after so many decades in power. Ultimately, he is the best judge of himself and his decisions; only he can review his life and know his real achievements and mistakes. So I had him talking to different versions of himself, to examine that life.\"\n\nThe exhibition opens today.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\n'Boo Sze Yang: The Father' runs till March 8 at iPreciation gallery, 50 Cuscaden Road, #01-01 (next to Hard Rock Cafe).

In particular, one clause - 6.2 - stated that KS Energy \"shall use all reasonable endeavours\" to procure the construction and delivery of the WPU within six months of the Charter Agreement being executed.\n\nThe JV engaged a Middle Eastern rig builder, Ordeco Inc, to deliver the WPU; Ordeco failed to do so on time, and BR Energy terminated the JV. It then sued KS Energy, claiming that KS Energy had breached the JV agreement by failing to exercise \"all reasonable endeavours\" in procuring the timely construction of the WPU - the failure of which led to the cancellation of the PCSB charter contract.\n\nThe Court of Appeal first looked at what \"all reasonable endeavours\" in Clause 6.2 entailed. It ruled that \"there is little or no relevant difference between the standard constituted by the formulation 'all reasonable endeavours' and that constituted by the formulation 'best endeavours',\" in the absence of parties specifying a difference between the two types of obligations.\n\nIt ruled, therefore, that the obligation placed on KS Energy was as onerous as that of the \"best endeavours\" obligation determined by the Court of Appeal in 2008, in its decision on Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine. \"Clause 6.2 therefore imposed on KS Energy the obligation to take all those reasonable steps which a prudent and determined company, acting in BR Energy's interests and anxious to procure the construction and delivery of the WPU within the available time, would have taken,\" it said.\n\nHaving determined that, the Court of Appeal then looked at whether KS Energy had indeed exercised \"all reasonable endeavours\" to procure the timely construction of the WPU.\n\nIt noted that KS Energy had made extensive efforts, including keeping close tabs on the goings-on at Ordeco, deploying its representatives to Ordeco's yard to monitor the construction of the WPU and pressuring Ordeco to deliver its obligations on time. It noted that KS Energy even loaned Ordeco money when the latter could not pay its staff. \"Nowhere in the evidence was it suggested that BR Energy was at any time unhappy with KS Energy's performance of its obligations,\" the court added.\n\n\"Most tellingly, KS Energy eventually took over the construction of the WPU itself; it obviously wanted to have the WPU completed,\" it said.\n\nThe court ruled therefore that KS Energy did not breach Clause 6.2 of the JV agreement, and that no damages were to be awarded to BR Energy, as a result.\n\nIt also ruled that BR Energy was not entitled to terminate the JV agreement but, as no substantive loss was caused by this wrongful termination, it did not award any damages to KS Energy in this respect.\n\nKS Energy was represented by senior counsel Alvin Yeo of WongPartnership. BR Energy was represented by senior counsel Philip Jeyaretnam of Rodyk & Davidson.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With a backbreaking schedule that has him jetting around the world for most of the year, inspiration is something that flits by and he has to capture it on his iPhone then and there. Then, in the comfort of his studio, he takes that musical moment and turns it into the magic that has made him one of the most successful musicians in the world.\n\n\"There's nothing exotic about how I get inspiration. There's only timing, and pressure,\" says the soft-spoken 47-year-old yesterday.\n\nRahman has been called \"the world's most prominent and prolific film composer\" by Time magazine, especially after he clinched two Academy Awards - for Best Original Score and Best Original Song - for his work on the 2008 sleeper hit Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nThis April, the music maestro will be back in Singapore for the AR Rahman Infinite Love Live - In Concert, where he will perform new songs and classics from his 24-year career. Classics include songs from the Tamil film Roja, a Hindi drama film Highway and, of course, Jai Ho from Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nDespite his high profile, Rahman reveals that he hasn't felt increased pressure to maintain his reputation. In fact it remains the same as when he first started out. \"The pressure was always there, from the beginning until now,\" he says. \"You know, when in your mind you set a standard and you have your own principles to fulfil. It's my own pressure that's always been there.\"\n\nWhat has changed since his early days, however, is the style and pace of how he works. \"Back in India, I could do seven movies at the same time. But in Hollywood, they expect you to do just one. We're so used to juggling, but they're focused. That's just how they work.\"\n\nHollywood has also influenced the quality of his work. There, he is in touch with some of the latest technology and greatest musicians, while in India, the scene is still growing with many new singers coming into the music industry.\n\nHe feeds off both sides, he adds. \"One complements the other. What I gain from one place, I give to the other, and what I gain from there I give back.\"\n\nWhile he's enjoyed more than enough acclaim to last him a couple of lifetimes, fame isn't the be all and end all of his career. What drives him is a lot simpler - to make music that touches people. \"You want something to remember,\" he muses. \"You want something to emotionally connect. Whether it's sad, or happy, makes you fall in love or want to dance. That's always been the point.

Of the $63.7 million, $53.5 million came from China/Hong Kong SAR, $7.47 million from British Virgin Islands, $2.26 million from Singapore and the rest from Taiwan and Indonesia.\n\nTranspac reported total comprehensive income of $47.4 million for fiscal 2013, which included profits realised on divestments and changes in fair value of the group's investments.\n\nLooking ahead, the company said there are signs that the growth outlook for the US, the eurozone and the UK have improved.\n\n\"If the growth can be sustained, it will positively impact the business outlook and demand in the developing economies of Asia. There is indication of some stability of growth albeit at a lower rate in China. If the trend continues, the investment activities in the Asian region will be likely to pick up.\"\n\nNo dividend was declared for the current financial period, but the company had earlier proposed, as part of an \"internalisation exercise\", an interim cash dividend of five cents per ordinary share to entitled shareholders for the fiscal year ended Dec 31.\n\nTranspac had announced plans to terminate its agreement with its investment manager, Transpac Capital Pte Ltd, for $13.75 million in an \"internalisation exercise\". Part of the exercise involved Transpac taking the investment services in-house by absorbing the staff of Transpac Capital.\n\nThe consideration of $13.75 million in cash, funded internally, took into account the loss to Transpac Capital from the early termination of the agreement before Dec 31, 2015, among other things, bringing to an end a management agreement that had been in place for almost 20 years since 1994.\n\nTranspac shares closed trading yesterday at $1.70, down one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are no Cheshire cats, but there are a few rabbit figurines on the shop floor that make good door-stoppers. Pretty lamps hang from the ceiling, while dried leaves and vines twirl around the shop displays.\n\nShop Wonderland is the retail arm of Wonderland for Detailed Planners, an events company that owner Melissa Wang started in 2010. It handles corporate and wedding events.\n\nIn 2012, she branched out into retail, focusing on local homeware brands. \"You have stores that retail local fashion labels, but there is little platform for local homeware, and I wanted to give these brands an option,\" says Ms Wang.\n\nSome of the local brands she carries include When I was Four, Japanese ceramic plates from Democratic Society, leaf-shaped plates from Davy Young's Leaves with Memories series, as well as gardening kits from Easy Gardens.\n\nMs Wang also carries some foreign brands, such as teacup sets from British designer Louise Wilkinson as well as candles from American label, Voluspa. The candles which retail from $39.90, along with cushions priced from $49.90, are the store's bestsellers.\n\n\"I pick items and brands which I would not mind using for the events that I'm planning for, or even for my own home,\" says Ms Wang. These brands are exclusive to Shop Wonderland in the Haji Lane area.\n\nShop Wonderland used to be located a few doors away but it was too small, so Ms Wang moved to this bigger space in December. The retail space takes up the second floor and with eye-catching bric-a-brac sprawled on a big table or on shelves by the side.\n\nPaper lanterns hover cheerfully overhead on the ceiling, lighting up the workshop space which Ms Wang uses to create floral displays or to conduct classes on floral crafts and watercolour illustration on weekends.\n\nSince reopening Shop Wonderland, Ms Wang has added a small cafe on the ground floor. She calls it The Pantry, and sells an assortment of cakes, muffins and pastries from Maple & Market, Carpenter & Cook and Plain Vanilla, alongside a selection of teas from Gryphon.\n\n\"Again, I wanted to work with local artisans,\" she says. Instead of paper lanterns, vintage lights with floral lampshades hang from the ceiling.\n\nThe overall look of Shop Wonderland is a little whimsical and magical, especially in the evenings. \"It's funny how visitors have used these terms to describe the place, but as long as it's not labelled as cute that's fine,\" she quips. \"Actually, I see Shop Wonderland more as an emporium of services, from cafe to retail with workshop space.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gross profit margin fell about one percentage point to 22.3 per cent.\n\nThe commodities firm booked a smaller gain from changes in fair value of biological assets, or its plantations.\n\nThis gain, which is based on the present value of the plantations' expected net cash inflows, fell 25.2 per cent to US$36.9 million.\n\nThe results were also boosted by the absence of one-off losses. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Golden-Agri recorded US$24.2 million in impairment losses from long-term investments and loan receivables.\n\nFor the full year, Golden-Agri's net profit attributable to equity-holders dropped 24 per cent to US$311 million, as lower international crude oil prices ate into the bottom line.\n\nCorrespondingly, the group's gross profit margin declined from 26.6 per cent in the previous year to 20.7 per cent in 2013.\n\nThe company has proposed a final dividend of 0.515 cent per share.\n\nThe counter closed 1.77 per cent lower at 55.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This company, according to a Straits Times report last week, was a third-party payment processor for online transactions in Taiwan called Neweb Technologies.\n\nThe Straits Times said customers of Citibank, DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank and OCBC Bank were hit by unauthorised charges to their cards, though some have had these transactions voided after being alerted by their respective banks. Some cardholders were alerted by text messages from banks about multiple transactions of close to $50 per transaction.\n\nA preliminary investigation of this case has pointed to data theft by \"parties other than regulated financial institutions\", MAS said.\n\n\"MAS has received confirmation from the banks that most affected customers have been contacted and assured that they would not be liable for the unauthorised charges.\"\n\nCiti's head of corporate affairs Adam Rahman said: \"Arising from last week's incident, the card associations have provided us with a list of all credit cards that are likely to be compromised.

This works out to $1,696 per square foot on its land area of 18,161 sq ft.\n\nLocated at a cul de sac, the freehold property has a swimming pool, five bedrooms and a maid's room. It is likely to be redeveloped.\n\nThe property is being sold by a retiree couple. The buyer is understood to be Imelda Tanoto. The Singapore citizen owns an adjoining bungalow while her parents are said to own another bungalow nearby.\n\nMs Tanoto is the eldest daughter of Singapore-based Indonesian tycoon Sukanto Tanoto of the Royal Golden Eagle International group, a holding company with businesses in a range of industries including paper, palm oil, construction and energy. It owns Singapore-headquartered Asia Pacific Resources International Limited, one of the world's biggest producers of fibre, pulp and fine paper.\n\nOver at Bin Tong Park, philanthropist Saw Swee Hock is said to have sold a two-storey bungalow for $31.5 million or $1,551 psf on land area of 20,315 sq ft. The buyer is believed to be Singaporean tycoon Goh Cheng Liang of Nippon Paint fame.\n\nThe property is said to be one of three adjacent bungalows held by Professor Saw as investment properties.\n\nThe demographer and statistician's philanthropic acts include a $30-million donation in 2011 to the National University of Singapore for establishing the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\nThe market is also abuzz with talk of a deal in the early stages for a two-storey bungalow in the Cluny area. Its pricing of about $30 million reflects slightly under $2,000 psf on land area. Standing on the site is a five to six-year old bungalow. Like the Margoliouth and Bin Tong Park properties, the Cluny bungalow is freehold.\n\nIncluding this property, there would be at least six transactions in GCB Areas since the start of the year, totalling about $170 million. That is a quarter of the $687.8 million of deals in GCB Areas sealed last year, according to data from CBRE, which also showed 29 transactions for 2013.\n\nLast year's showing was a sharp slowdown from the 54 transactions totalling $1.17 billion in 2012 - blamed on the January 2013 property cooling measures which raised additional buyer's stamp duty on purchases of residential properties, including those by Singaporean investors. Loan-to value limits were also lowered and minimum cash downpayments increased for those applying for their second or subsequent home mortgages.\n\nA bigger blow came in late June, when the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework was announced, along with the shutting of a loophole that some property investors had been using to avoid paying higher ABSD rates and to circumvent the tighter LTV limits.\n\nBased on CBRE's GCB transaction data for 2013, only seven properties changed hands after the TDSR rollout, compared with 22 before that.\n\n\"The GCB market has been quite active lately, probably because of pent-up demand from a lack of activity in the last few months of 2013,\" said William Wong, managing director of RealStar Premier. His company brokered the Margoliouth transaction but declined to comment on the buyer's identity.\n\n\"I think the situation in the GCB market has stabilised. Any price decline since last June has been pretty marginal; buyers are not expecting a big price drop and they're more prepared to come into the market right now.\"\n\nThis is unlike the situation for smaller bungalows in non-GCB Areas and semi-detached houses, where the price drop has been bigger, around 5-8 per cent between June and December last year. So potential buyers would be more inclined to wait for a further price decline with most prepared to go into the market only in the later part of this year. \"GCBs have more scarcity and rarity value,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nNewsman Realty managing director K H Tan too said that the level of activity in the GCB market lately has surpassed his earlier expectation. \"We're getting more viewings compared with last month.

The bond is payable if the project is not completed by the consortium for any reason.\n\nThe insurer was ready to provide the loan if shareholders of the consortium, which is led by Spain's Sacyr and Italy's Salini Impregilo and includes a Belgian and a Panamanian company, shoulder the risk and are liable for repaying the loan, one source said.\n\nBut the consortium's chief executive officers want the insurer to be the primary risk-holder, which Zurich considers unacceptable, one source said.\n\nA key issue centred on the share of the risk the Italian and Spanish governments would take, one source said.\n\nSpain's majority state-owned insurer Cesce, set up to financially aid international expansion of Spanish companies, provided a guarantee for the Sacyr bid in 2009. Although Cesce has declined to comment on how much was guaranteed, a source with knowledge of the operation said that it was for US$200 million and helped underwrite the US$400 million Zurich bond.\n\nThe parties also continued to debate a weekend proposal by the canal authority that would allow work to restart immediately, with it and the consortium each contributing US$100 million.\n\nBut a source familiar with the negotiations said that the consortium had not yet accepted the deal and wanted to wait on an answer from Zurich.\n\nThe overall expansion project, of which the consortium is building the lion's share, was originally expected to cost about US$5.25 billion, but the overruns could increase that to nearly US$7 billion. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Defence contractors would pick January.\n\nThe Pentagon's contract awards dropped 66 per cent from December to US$8.44 billion, the lowest level in at least 22 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The previous low during that period was US$12.1 billion in January 2013.\n\nNone of the biggest contracts announced last month - including those to General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp - cracked US$1 billion. Last month's awards often lag because the Pentagon often pushes out more agreements in December, the end of its first quarter. The seasonal slump was exacerbated by defence budget reductions and a temporary spending bill that limited contracting last month. \"The elements have certainly come together,\" said Mark Amtower, partner at Amtower & Co, a government contracting consulting firm in Clarksville, Maryland.\n\nMr Amtower said that he expects another poor monthly performance when awards dip below US$8.4 billion this fiscal year. \"I don't see this trend going away any time soon,\" he said.\n\nThe Defense Department announced 180 contracts with a maximum value of US$8.44 billion last month, compared with 295 agreements valued at as much as US$24.9 billion in December. Awards dropped 30 per cent last month from a year earlier.\n\nThe Pentagon is required to announce contracts of at least US$6.5 million.\n\nThe temporary spending bill restricted new contracts and projects. Those limits ended after President Barack Obama on Jan 17 signed a US$1.1 trillion measure to fund the government through Sept 30. That followed stop-gap legislation enacted in October, which ended a 16-day partial government shutdown.\n\n\"The uncertainty of a government budget just paralysed the agencies,\" said Robert Lohfeld, chief executive officer of Edgewater, Maryland-based Lohfeld Consulting Group.\n\nBruce Tanner, chief financial officer of Lockheed Martin, told investors during a conference call on the company's fourth-quarter results that he anticipated \"a trough\" in US defence spending this year.\n\nRaytheon's chief financial officer, Dave Wajsgras, said on Jan 30 that he didn't expect increased government business until the second half of this year.\n\nThe trend, though, is going to be down, said Larry Allen, president of Allen Federal Business Partners, a consulting company based in McLean, Virginia.\n\n\"The budget is a good thing overall, but it doesn't mean there's a new day coming,\" Mr Allen said. \"We're still in an era where there's less money than there has been historically.\"\n\nThe defence spending cuts helped make last year the fourth consecutive year in which contract awards declined, the longest stretch since Ronald Reagan was president, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries analyst Brian Friel.\n\nThe agreement that ended the government shutdown also set spending levels through Sept 30, 2015, partially mitigating the automatic federal spending cuts required under the process known as sequestration.\n\n\"I'm very encouraged that we got it pushed out for a couple of years,\" Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive officer, said on Feb 10.\n\n\"We're going to continue to focus on encouraging our lawmakers to take sequestration off the table and allow our customers to have the flexibility to make the decisions on where they spend their dollars to meet the national security needs of the country,\" Ms Hewson said.\n\nIn an austere environment, companies seeking federal work have to be increasingly competitive on price.\n\n\"You knew there had to be downward pressure on the defence budget and the overall federal budget,\" said Tony Smeraglinolo, chief executive officer of Chantilly, Virginia-based Engility Holdings. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

This was reflected in a drop in shipments to all of Singapore's top 10 markets (which accounted for 78 per cent of total NODX), except for China and Taiwan.\n\nTotal trade dipped 0.5 per cent to $980.2 billion in 2013, against a 1.1 per cent rise the year before. The decline fell short of the 1-2 per cent growth that IE Singapore had expected.\n\nNon-oil re-exports (NORX) was about the only important indicator that was up last year, jumping 9.8 per cent following a 0.3 per cent increase in 2012.\n\nIE Singapore is looking to only \"modest improvement\" in the global economy in 2014. While the American and European economies are slowly recovering, it said that \"there are some key uncertainties in the global economic environment\".\n\nThese include the pace at which the US is unwinding its economic stimulus and the on-going restructuring of China's economy.\n\n\"Taking all these into consideration, the projections for both total trade and NODX are maintained at between one and 3 per cent in 2014,\" it said.\n\nLast year's NODX was dragged down by both electronic and non-electronic shipments. Electronics NODX sank 11.3 per cent after a 4.1 per cent drop in 2012. Non-electronics NODX fell 3.3 per cent, against a 3 per cent increase in 2012.\n\nNODX shipments to the European Union fell 25.5 per cent in 2013, the largest fall in the top 10 markets. Shipments to South Korea tumbled 25.3 per cent.\n\nChina and Taiwan, the only two markets where NODX was up, saw shipments jump 11.8 and one per cent, respectively.\n\nIE Singapore also reported that quarterly, total trade expanded 3.8 per cent year on year in the last three months of 2013, after a 5.8 per cent rise in the previous quarter.\n\nNODX slipped 2.1 per cent in the final quarter, easing from a 3.6 per cent dip in the third quarter. The NORX was up 16.6 per cent in Q4 and jumped 11.3 per cent in Q3.\n\nMeanwhile, in a paper on the recent divergence in Singapore's electronics output and domestic exports growth, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said that the unusual development is partly explained by a build-up of electronics firms in anticipation of a stronger demand ahead, as well as \"firm-specific factors where some electronics wholesale firms saw weak domestic exports over the period\".\n\n\"Increasingly, with production chain fragmentation, electronics firms may also decide to locate their high value-added activities, such as design, in Singapore and outsource lower value-added production activities to overseas contract manufacturers,\" the paper said.\n\nIt pointed out that such activities may be captured as Singapore's factory output, but they may not show up as a corresponding increase in NODX.\n\n\"Going forward, how firms continue to react to changes in their operating environment will have an impact on trends in electronics index of industrial production and electronics domestic exports,\" the paper said.\n\nThe divergence first appeared when electronics factory output started to pick up in Q2/2013, after several quarters of decline. Electronics domestic exports, however, remained weak. Many private sector economists saw this as a sign that Singapore is losing its competitive edge in electronics.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From end October, it will deploy its 469-seater A380 three times weekly on one of those daily flights, replacing the existing 299-seater Boeing 747, with an eye on using the A380 daily down the line.\n\nThe other flight operates daily on the \"Kangaroo\" route from London to Sydney (via Singapore) and will continue to use the B777-300ER.\n\n\"(We've) seen impressive results for Singapore this year,\" said Robert Williams, BA's regional general manager (South-east Asia), adding that it is responding to the strong load factors by adding more capacity on the route. The transition to the A380 will increase the number of seats on the route by more than four thousand monthly.\n\nBA has ordered 12 A380 double-decker jumbo jets, of which it has already taken delivery of four with a further four deliveries expected later in the year. In addition, it has also ordered 24 of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.\n\nOn average, the airline will receive a new plane every two weeks till October.

Not in the way that it should be talked about - openly, honestly and factually.\n\nStudies show that people naturally assume that fat people are lazy and lacking in self-control. Bosses pay plus-sized women less than skinny women. And parents penalise their fat kids more often than their skinnier kids.\n\nBut studies also show that, for many obese people, it is a combination of genetic and biological factors that induces them to eat as much as they do. If they try to be slimmer by eating much less, they exist in a constant state of hunger and frustration - every day, all of the time.\n\nSo when Helen, the titular character in the terrific new play Fat Pig, says: \"I can't help it, I'm just hungry\", and proceeds to gobble up her food amid disapproving stares from others, she means every word of it - she can't help it, she's really hungry.\n\nWritten by Neil LaBute, Fat Pig is a powerful play because it dissects our deeply-held biases and assumptions about plus-sized people.\n\nProduced by Pangdemonium and directed by Tracie Pang, it is also the perfect anti-romantic comedy, a play that begins as sweetly as any rom-com does when two cute people meet, but then devolves into a ruthless, relentless tragedy.\n\nFrom the moment Tom (Gavin Yap) enters a crowded restaurant and shares a table with a plus-sized stranger named Helen (an incandescent Frances Lee), you know they are going to fall in love. Tom's nervous laughter and Helen's stolen glances speak volumes about their attraction. Their dinner dates and moments in bed together are as perfect as they can be.\n\nBut when Tom's colleagues Carter (Zachary Ibrahim) and Jeannie (Liz Lazan) find out that he's dating a plus-sized woman, things take a turn for crazy. Despite the obvious fact that Tom and Helen are match-made in heaven, the vile attacks made by Tom's colleagues on Helen's weight threaten to drive the perfect couple apart. Tom wishes he exists in a world where no one judges Helen's weight, or him for dating her, but knows one doesn't exist.\n\nBracing and provocative, Fat Pig is a play that demands to be seen. LaBute injects a lot of sweetness and hope (mostly in the character of Helen) amid the cynical proceedings. And there's enough real chemistry and affection between Tom and Helen to believe they can overcome societal pressures.\n\nThe drama is orchestrated so expertly that one moment, you could be rooting for the lovely couple, and the next moment, reeling from the spitefulness of Carter and Jeannie.\n\nPang has assembled a cast of young and relatively unknown actors. But each one thoroughly excels in his or her role: Yap as the vulnerable and sincere Tom, Ibrahim as the misanthropic Carter, and Lazan as the perfect skinny witch Jeanne.\n\nBut the real revelation here is lead actress Lee, who's only 23 and still in acting school. Lee plays Helen as a woman whose sunny disposition and self-deprecating humour are hard-won qualities.\n\nIn one particularly poignant scene, Lee invests her character with so much truth and honesty that you wish you could go up on stage and hug her and tell her that people can be stupid and cruel and she needn't pay any heed to them.\n\nYou're so transported, you forget it's a performance.\n\n'Fat Pig' plays at DBS Arts Centre at Merbau Road from now to March 2.

The worst episode occurred last year, and there are early signs of a recurrence this year.\n\n\"The root cause is commercial. It is not the weather or the environment. Errant companies have been clearing land by illegal burning because it is the cheapest way to do so. Although there are domestic laws against this practice, there are real problems in investigation and enforcement in those countries.\"\n\nSingapore thus needs to go further by having legislation with extra-territorial application, he said.\n\nThe proposed law will also provide for civil liability, meaning Singaporeans may sue these errant companies for personal injury, damage to their property or other losses resulting from transboundary haze.\n\n\"We hope this legislation will send a strong signal of deterrence to such errant companies,\" said the minister.\n\nAmong the bill's key features is a criminal penalty of up to $300,000 which may be imposed against entities which authorise or engage in acts causing transboundary haze here.\n\nThe fine may be bumped up to $450,000 if the entity deliberately ignores requests by the authorities to do the necessary to prevent, reduce or control the haze pollution.\n\nCivil damages recoverable under the bill will be determined by Singapore courts, based on evidence of personal injury, physical damage or economic losses.\n\nJoseph Chun, a partner at Rodyk & Davidson LLP, lauded the intent behind the bill, calling it a good effort, but also raised questions about its implementation.\n\n\"On civil liability, aside from proving that the conduct caused or contributed to the haze, a claimant would have to show on a balance of probability that his personal injury, disease, mental or physical incapacity or death is a consequence of the defendant's conduct.\n\n\"This may be very difficult as, firstly, there may be a time lag between the haze pollution and the personal injury. So there would be difficulty collecting evidence.\"\n\nSecondly, there may be many causes that led to personal injury, and haze pollution may be only a contributing factor, he said. It would be challenging to prove that the defendant's conduct caused the personal injury if the conduct only resulted in a small fire relative to the total number of hot spots at the time. How would the court attribute the proportion of the defendant's responsibility? Similar difficulties would apply to those claiming for property damage and economic loss.\n\nOn criminal liability, it would be difficult to prove causation or contribution of conduct to haze pollution in Singapore. For example, if an entity caused a fire and the prosecution wanted to prove the entity caused or contributed to the haze pollution here, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that haze pollution at least partly came from that fire.\n\nThat would, presumably, entail considering how thick the smoke is and whether smoke from that fire actually travelled to Singapore, said Mr Chun.\n\nIn response to the draft bill, a spokesman for Golden Agri-Resources (GAR), which said it was the first palm-oil producer to establish a zero-burning policy in 1997, said: \"GAR and its subsidiary, PT SMART Tbk, are absolutely against burning . . . We believe that a multi-stakeholder collaborative approach is the best way to find solutions for the haze issue.\"\n\nThe spokesman added that during last year's haze, GAR deployed all its resources and worked closely with the Indonesian government and other groups such as civil-society organisations, community groups and other growers to contribute to fire-fighting efforts. \"We believe that businesses must act responsibly.\"\n\nAsia Pacific Resources International (APRIL), in a statement to The Business Times, said: \"Forest fires in Sumatra diminish air quality and threaten public health over large parts of South-east Asia. They also damage plantations that provide wood for our paper-and-pulp mill. That's why we strictly forbid burning within APRIL concessions and aggressively fight fires that spread from outside areas. We can't comment on the proposed legislation until we've had time to review it, but we encourage public-private sector collaboration that can result in practical solutions to the haze problem.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tax credit was mainly due to the write back of $3.76 million in tax over-provision for prior years, SuperBowl said.\n\nProfit before tax (PBT) was $2.97 million, down 14.8 per cent from the year-ago period, dragged by higher staff costs and a fair value loss.\n\nRevenue for the period rose 6.3 per cent to $4.77 million.\n\nEarnings per share for the quarter were 2.02 cents, up from 0.98 cent previously. A final dividend of half a cent per share, unchanged from a year ago, was proposed.\n\nFor FY2013, SuperBowl's net profit was down 23.7 per cent, from $12.85 million or 3.95 cents per share to $9.81 million or 3.01 cents per share. Revenue, however, gained 6.6 per cent to $18.23 million, mainly driven by its bowling business.\n\nFactors causing net profit to fall include a 53.8 per cent drop in share of profit from joint ventures to $3.76 million, from $8.1 million a year ago. Higher staff cost, other operating expenses and a fair value loss, also ate away at the bottom line. These were partially offset by $3.03 million in tax credit for FY2013 against $1.4 million tax expenses a year earlier.\n\nPBT for the full year was down 52.4 per cent at $6.78 million.\n\nSuperBowl said that it was \"bracing itself for cost pressures in its new labour-intensive hospitality business in view of tight labour market conditions.\"\n\n\"To mitigate this, the group will keep a vigilant rein on its costs in the management of its workflow and operations across its business segments, while keeping a lookout for new market or joint venture opportunities to take its business forward,\" it said.\n\nSuperBowl shares closed unchanged at 75 cents yesterday, before the earnings were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rates are stated according to use groups across 118 geographical sectors in Singapore.\n\nDC rates for the major use groups are expressed as per square metre of gross floor area.\n\nProperty consultants said the modest rise in residential DC rates was in line with softening home prices in the past half year.\n\nSigns of incipient softening in the industrial property market were probably behind the decision to leave DC rates for the use group unchanged. This was despite ample evidence of industrial sites fetching prices at state tenders that were higher than land values implied by the previous DC rates, argued Colliers International director Chia Siew Chuin.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle's (JLL) head of SE Asia research, Chua Yang Liang, said the DC rate hike for hotel use was supported by the active hotel investment market.\n\n\"Typically, DC is payable for sites where the development potential has not been fully maximised (mostly privately held sites),\" explained Karamjit Singh, head of investments and residential at JLL. \"Even for sites where the gross floor area has been maximised, DC rates are still relevant for the amount of money payable to the state to build the 10 per cent bonus GFA for balcony and other use. This applies even to 99-year condo sites bought at state tenders,\" he added.\n\nDuring the heyday of collective sales, DC rates were closely monitored by property agents and owners with en bloc potential. However, the impact of this round of DC rate revisions on residential en bloc sales is very minimal, said Mr Singh. \"In any case usually less than half of en blocs attract DC and even then DC forms a relatively small component of the entire land cost.\"\n\nThis round, non-landed residential DC rates have been raised in only 15 geographical sectors (by 6 to 10 per cent), with no changes in the remaining 103 sectors. The largest increase at 10 per cent is in Sector 101 (Paya Lebar/Aljunied/Macpherson/\n\nSims Avenue/Eunos Link). The increase was supported by the sale of a 99-year private housing site in Geylang East Avenue 1 at a state tender in January at $776 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) - or 67 per cent above the land value implied by the-then prevailing Sept 1, 2013, DC rate, explained Colliers' Ms Chia.\n\nShe suggested that a 9.1 per cent rise in Sector 100 (including Sengkang/Punggol) could have been due to the sales of two adjoining sites in Upper Serangoon View in December for $522 psf ppr - 33 per cent more than the Sept 1, 2013, DC rate-implied land value. The other locations that saw higher non-landed residential DC rates include the sectors that include Kallang, Upper Boon Keng, Geylang Bahru, Tampines, Bedok Reservoir, Kembangan, Pasir Ris, Choa Chu Kang, Woodlands, Sembawang, Seletar, Bukit Batok, Mount Emily, Bendemeer and Whampoa.\n\nCommercial use DC rates were raised for 89 geographical sectors (by 14-29 per cent), with no changes in the other 29.\n\nThe biggest hike of 29 per cent was for Sector 108 (which includes Sixth Avenue, Holland Road, Commonwealth Avenue Tanglin Road, Adam Road). This was supported by the sale of 100 Taman Warna which, based on JLL's analysis, was 54 per cent above the previous DC rate-implied land value. In Upper Thomson, the transaction of Long House at 41 per cent premium to the previous DC rate-implied land value probably supported a 22 per cent hike for Sector 107.\n\nThe same percentage rate hike was seen in Sector 53 (which includes Little India), in the light of Serangoon Plaza's sale at 169 per cent above the DC rate-implied land value - producing a knock-on effect on the neighbouring Sector 58, which posted a 21 per cent rise.\n\nTang Wei Leng, executive director (investment sales) at Colliers International, said DC rates remained unchanged for the two major commercial en bloc sales she is working on - The Arcade in Collyer Quay and Tanglin Shopping Centre. \"In the past six months, there have been no significant commercial property deals in these locations to justify any change in DC rates.\"\n\nFor landed residential use, DC rate were upped in 13 sectors by 9-10 per cent, with no change for the remaining 105 sectors. For hotel/hospital use group, the biggest jump of 31 per cent is arein Sectors 93 & 94 (Changi Road/East Coast/Marine Parade area).\n\nFrom today, the Urban Redevelopment Authority's website offers a new free e-service that allows information on DC rates to be accurately retrieved for any site on a Geographical Information System-enabled digital map.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This should be considered 'good news' for Singapore, as affordability and supply are key to business expansion, job creation and economic prosperity,\" added Mr Dodd.\n\nIn terms of rental growth, Singapore posted the third-largest rental increase in Asia Pacific, behind Jakarta and Bangkok, where prime rents rose 20 per cent in both cities.\n\nSingapore was the seventh most expensive location in Asia Pacific. Hong Kong kept its regional crown (1,432 euros psm per year), followed by Beijing (1,027 euros), and Tokyo (1,003 euros).\n\nComparing Singapore with Hong Kong, Sigrid Zialcita, managing director for Cushman & Wakefield's research team in Asia Pacific, noted that despite the rental growth here, the Republic's office market continues to be more affordable than Hong Kong's Central district.\n\n\"Rents in Central are holding steady at their high levels despite the lack of any strong demand catalyst, notably for prime and large spaces where vacancies are higher,\" said Ms Zialcita.\n\n\"Many tenants still remain loyal to the district. However, tenants in Central will continue to pay a premium especially if demand rises more meaningfully and vacancies remain at ultra-low levels. In Singapore, rents will remain at their competitive level especially with upcoming new supply.\"\n\nAccording to the 2014 ranking, Singapore is the 11th most expensive location by country, versus its 14th position last year.\n\nLondon was the most expensive office market for the second year in a row, followed by Hong Kong. The third position went to Moscow (1,092 euros psm per year) after the city climbed three spots from sixth position a year ago.\n\nGlobal office rents rose 3 per cent last year, while rents in Asia Pacific went up 2 per cent.\n\nAsia Pacific's performance in 2014 is expected to be similar to 2013, as slow and stable demand keeps rental levels largely unchanged, though incentives will become more competitive, said Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nChina, Japan, and South-east Asia are expected to drive the region forward, with demand for office space in these areas gaining momentum in the course of the year, it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just 11 per cent of Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust's S$200 million of six-year notes went to high net worth individuals, another person said.\n\nPerpetual note sales of S$500 million this year-to- date compare with zero for the same period in every year going back to 1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The \"great rotation\" by investors from bonds into equities has yet to occur, UBS AG, the biggest private bank in Asia, said in a report this month. Perpetuals are popular with rich people in Singapore, Asia's largest private banking centre with offshore assets of about US$800 billion, because the higher coupons they offer match those investors' greater appetite for risk.\n\n\"The fact we've seen two deals done in quick succession shows there's more and more confidence in the product,\" said Clifford Lee, the Singapore-based head of fixed-income at DBS Group Holdings Ltd, the island's top-ranked bond arranger since 2008. \"There was talk of money going out of fixed income into equities last year but now, the reverse is true. If the market holds up, I definitely expect more perpetuals to come.\"\n\nPerpetual bonds typically pay more than those with a set maturity to compensate investors for the risk the notes won't ever mature and therefore be paid back by the company. They are generally honoured before equity in the event of default and such equity-related features mean the securities can lower a company's debt-to-equity ratio.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index of equities closed at a more than five-month low of 916.56 on Feb 5 amid concern that slowing growth in China and a pullback in US monetary stimulus will sap momentum in economies from Indonesia to India.\n\nSingapore's Straits Times Index has lost 3.1 per cent this year, after falling to a 15-month low on Feb 5. That compares with an almost one per cent gain for corporate and government notes denominated in the currency, HSBC Holdings plc indexes show.\n\nTrafigura sold S$200 million of perpetuals at a yield of 7.5 per cent on Feb 10.

This led to full-year FY2013 core Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) loss of US$231 million for the liner division.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, liner revenue also decreased 8 per cent year on year to US$1.9 billion, on lower freight rates and capacity management. Overall, volume was mostly unchanged as higher Transpacific and Intra-Asia trades offset lower volumes in other trade lanes.\n\nQ4 average revenue per FEU was 8 per cent lower at US$2,218.\n\nThe liner recorded a core Ebit loss of US$101 million in Q4 FY2013, compared with a loss of US$82 million in Q4 FY2012.\n\nThe group's logistics division saw an unchanged Q4 FY2013 revenue of US$434 million, but core Ebit declined 27 per cent year on year to US$19 million, mainly due to lower contributions from the contract logistics segment which saw a slow auto sector recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But instead of ships, he is betting on Chinese companies that are seeking a foothold in Europe.\n\nMr Xu said that more than 60 Chinese businesses, many already tenants of his empire in China, have signed up to take space in the development, about 14.5 km east of London's city centre. Construction on what is planned as 4.5 million square feet of office space, to be done in phases through 2022, could start as soon as this summer.\n\nThe plan has the backing of Mayor Boris Johnson, who welcomed the investment. Lying untouched since the docks closed in 1981, a hundred years after they were built for ships too big to dock farther up the Thames, the site is one of the largest undeveloped areas in London and as such has been a major headache for the city.\n\nDespite the initial investment, questions remain as to whether the project will succeed. Other plans for the area have failed, and some officials question how many local jobs the Chinese investment will create.\n\nAlex Foshay, a partner at real estate agency Knight Frank in London, said that he did not think Mr Xu would have any problem filling office space. Rising demand from tenants as Britain's economy recovers, combined with a backlog of planned developments, is pushing up rents and creating a shortage of supply, he said.\n\nStanding on the Docklands Light Railway platform at the Royal Albert Dock station, it is hard to imagine that the windswept patches of grass, parking lots and concrete walkways could one day be a bustling business centre with restaurants, residences and a hotel.\n\nThe area benefits from a large waterfront, an advantage when attracting Chinese companies because of its importance in fengshui, which holds that water can help the flow of energy. It is also a 10-minute train ride to the Canary Wharf financial district.\n\nMr Xu's business park is unlikely to face much opposition from neighbours, mainly because there are none. The existing residential developments are separated from the site by a busy highway, and many residents would welcome anything that would bring restaurants and stores to the area.\n\n\"It's wasteland now, so it can only get better,\" said Kelly Newsome, who has lived in the area for more than four years. \"If the project will create jobs and inject money into the area, that would be very welcome.\"\n\nMr Johnson has said that Mr Xu's plan would eventually add \u00a36 billion pounds (S$12.6 billion) to the British economy and turn what was once one of \"the throbbing arteries of UK trade and commerce\" into \"a world-class international business district\".\n\nMr Xu said that his company, Advanced Business Park, would provide 30 per cent of the US$1.6 billion investment to construct offices and public and retailing spaces. The rest would come from investors, banks and the presale of office units.\n\nThe government plans to sell Mr Xu the 14 hectares of the Royal Albert Dock, although the sale price was not disclosed. The development, being in what is now a derelict zone, is eligible for tax advantages.\n\nBut some of Mr Johnson's critics have branded the project the latest example of what they see as his willingness to sell parts of London to the highest bidder too easily. Just west of the Royal Albert Dock, Mr Johnson struck a sponsorship deal with the airline Emirates for a cable car across the Thames in 2012 and secured funds from Abu Dhabi for the ExCeL London conference centre in 2008.\n\nThe Financial Times reported last year that questions were raised in China about the source of Mr Xu's finances for his developments and his links to the Chinese government.\n\nIn an interview, Mr Xu dismissed accusations of close government ties and said that he made his money designing knitting machines and other appliances before setting up his real estate company.\n\nAdvanced Business Park owns a business complex in Beijing and has two similar projects under construction. An additional project in Hangzhou Bay, close to Shanghai, is planned to be the size of central London, including a green space the size of Hyde Park.\n\nMr Xu's London plan is by far his smallest, but it comes with challenges. The airplanes taking off and landing at London City Airport just across the water interrupt any calm the waterfront might create.\n\nAnd the Newham Borough Council, which is in charge of the area, has imposed strict rules about a timetable for the construction and how many local jobs the project must create. Previous projects for the area, which included a floating village, failed because they fell afoul of local rules and ran short of developer financing.\n\nSitting in his temporary office in the Royal Albert Dock, a former storage space designed to keep beef shipments from Argentina dry and cool, Mr Xu seemed unfazed. Speaking through an interpreter, he said that he was not worried about Britain's bureaucratic hoops to gain building permission.\n\n\"There is more structure in the UK system,\" he said with a smile. \"But the council of Newham is adapting to our speed.\"\n\nMr Xu said that his company expected to get planning permission in the coming months and to start construction of the business park this year.\n\nPatricia Holland, a member of the Newham council, said that Mr Xu's planning application was getting a good reception.\n\nNewham, a relatively poor borough that has been struggling to reduce unemployment, said that it expected the project to create 20,000 jobs and increase employment locally by 30 per cent. Some residents have questioned whether the new Chinese neighbours will indeed seek to employ local staff members without Mandarin language skills.\n\nBut Ms Holland also said that residents were excited that the project would turn into \"something that has more soul because people will care more about it, just like Canary Wharf\".\n\nChinese companies that pledged to take offices in the Royal Albert Dock include Eve Fashion Group, a male fashion brand; China Water Group, a water and sewage treatment provider; and Guangyao Oriental Group, a real estate development company.\n\nEven if the project goes ahead as planned, such regenerations can take decades to be successful, said Michael Edwards, a senior lecturer at University College London's Bartlett School of Planning.\n\nCanary Wharf's initial developers went bankrupt in the commercial real estate collapse of the 1990s. It took decades and large sums of government investment to improve transportation links to attract the global businesses that now provide more than 100,000 jobs. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Instead, the firms will approach vendors and buy the product or service from them. For established solutions, the vendors are pre-qualified; and for emerging ones, the vendors will submit a proposal to IDA for evaluation. Post-sale, the vendors will be reimbursed directly by IDA upon the fulfilment of certain conditions.\n\nThis streamlining of the process at the industry level was deemed a \"big improvement\" by Tan Bin Eng, partner, Business Incentives Advisory at Ernst & Young Solutions LLP.\n\n\"This will help tremendously with the SMEs, which have struggled with the fact that there are a lot of incentives out there but they have no knowledge or resources to go out and obtain them,\" she said.\n\nThis approach is also appealing from a cash flow standpoint. \"SMEs will only pay 30 per cent and 20 per cent upfront, respectively, for the two initiatives under IPG. This would help clear the concern of cash flow for SMEs,\" Tan Ching Ne, R&D tax partner at PwC Singapore, noted.\n\nThe IPG programme's third element will see the government helping to wire SMEs up for high-speed connectivity. Qualifying SMEs may get a 50 per cent subsidy on their monthly recurrent fibre subscription plan cost of at least 100 megabits per second, capped at $120 a month up to 24 months.\n\nThe one-time acquisition cost of Wireless@SG equipment for businesses that need a wireless connection in their public-facing premises will be subsidised up to $2,400 as well. At the building level, an 80 per cent subsidy of up to $200,000 on one-time enhancements necessary for fibre broadband installation will be offered.\n\nThis assistance will be targeted at owners of eligible non-residential buildings with multiple tenants.\n\nAccording to Lennon Lee, entrepreneurial and private clients tax partner at PwC Singapore, these ICT incentives have the older and less tech-savvy firms in their cross-hairs. To qualify for the connectivity subsidy, for example, the SME must not already have subscribed to a fibre broadband plan.\n\nWhile Mr Lee believes that the measures will be positive for firms, this is predicated on their being willing to change. \"It's a mindset shift that has to start. Using iPads, or the cloud (are) things that older SMEs have never embarked on,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nTHE ICT for Productivity and Growth (IPG) programme targeted at SMEs covers three key initiatives:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Here are their answers. They will also share their reactions after the Budget speech is delivered. By MALMINDERJIT SINGH\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Feb 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nINGRID SIDIADINOTO\n\nManaging director, UPS Singapore\n\n\"There are issues facing SMEs today in terms of a tougher business environment due to labour shortage and cost pressure. This affects productivity and efficiency, and, ultimately, competitiveness. SMEs can benefit from additional grants to enhance their internal training programmes and equip employees with better skill sets.\n\nIn addition, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the way customers shop. SMEs will need to realign their marketing strategy to capture the exponential growth in the online space. However, many companies are still at an infancy stage. The Budget should provide further subsidies for SMEs to better their understanding in this area and increase their competitiveness in the digital world. It is important to see initiatives to boost the economy's growth and productivity, reinforcing Singapore's competitiveness across the region.\"\n\n\"The success of Singapore's future lies with the next generation. Providing high-quality education is crucial to the development of our future leaders. I hope to see continued investment in the education system and ensuring that the cost of education remains affordable for everyone in Singapore.\n\nContinued focus on healthcare is also key to the development of Singapore. The nation's commitment to healthcare lends itself well to it being one of the world's major healthcare hubs, and this is why UPS has established our first dedicated healthcare facility in Asia in Singapore, to serve the rapid growth of our healthcare business in the region. It is also equally important to provide a well-established, comprehensive and accessible healthcare system for Singaporeans. I look forward to hearing the reforms.\"\n\nONG JUN QUAN\n\nExecutive director, Soon Li Heng\n\nCivil Engineering\n\n\"I would like to see the government render more help to SMEs in the Budget, not just in terms of grants but also to get industrial space. I understand that the leases for the industrial space in Sungei Kadut and Defu Lane areas are expiring soon, but companies will require more options other than moving to Tuas, where there is industrial space available, as that will be too far away and also may not be suitable usage space for all kinds of industries. So for me, industrial land is the main issue.\n\nThe government has been doing a good job in offering grants to SMEs but maybe they need to focus more now on the micro-SMEs, which have a headcount of up to 10 people. The bigger-sized SMEs generally have the expertise to apply for and obtain government grants but the micro-SMEs may not have the resources or expertise to do so. The government should thus focus on them. For example, my company has already reached our maximum for the grants we are eligible for, but some of my friends' companies have not even applied as they are smaller and have difficulty applying for the grants.\"\n\n\"I expect income tax and GST rates to stay the same and not be increased. Any increase would be met with concern, especially since the economic outlook is not rosy. The government is already doing well to spend on healthcare, infrastructure development and public housing. I expect it to continue along these lines. So the Budget should see more of such spending.\"\n\nYONG YEAN CHAU\n\nCEO of Parkway Trust Management (manager of Parkway Life Reit)\n\n\"The recent development of retirement communities in Singapore reflects a shift in societal trends similar to developed countries like Japan. Parkway Life Reit is no stranger to this development, having been entrenched in the Japan nursing home market since 2008 as a major player, and we see an interesting parallel between Singapore and Japan.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the government has in mind for the healthcare industry in the long-term. As the ageing population puts more strain on the healthcare industry, I look forward to see further instruments on top of basic healthcare subsidies and insurance that could help harmonise long-term needs with short-term sentiment in a sustainable manner.\"\n\n\" It is encouraging to see that recent government measures, such as the Pioneer Generation Package, demonstrate the government's priority on healthcare issues and strengthening protection in this area for the elderly. While this is a step in the right direction, it is important that policies keep pace with the changes in the marketplace. In situations where patients require more protection, there should be a case for reviewing the overall package to ensure that they continue to receive adequate support.\n\nWhile acknowledging that better and more extensive protection would incur higher costs, I hope that taxes will . . . remain affordable for average Singaporeans. Additionally, while it is difficult to appease everyone, as a tax payer, I believe prioritisation is key and hope that taxes paid by Singaporeans on their hard- earned money is wisely spent on public services that will enhance our quality of life. In the realm of healthcare, it will be comforting to know that funds are directed to those who need it most and the healthcare initiatives that support our ageing population as demands on aged care increase.\n\nARUN NARULA\n\nChairman of Mercantile Pacific Asia\n\n\"I hope the Budget will address the tight labour market problem by relaxing employment laws and, specifically, relax the quota on foreign employees. This is important for SMEs like us as it would allow us to attract talented people at lower costs. It is a challenge for SMEs to find good and skilled workers as we also face competition from the larger corporations for talent because they can offer higher wages. I also hope the government will increase the granting of the PR status so that it would help us retain the talent that we attract.\"\n\n\"The government is largely doing a good job and I see no issues. The income tax rate and GST rate here are competitive and I do not expect the government to increase these.\"\n\nDOUGLAS FOO\n\nChairman of Sakae Holdings\n\n\"I hope to see continued support for SMEs in terms of productivity and innovation. This would hopefully be in terms of increasing the quantum of the grant amount and extending the grant period, but especially the latter at the very least. This would give SMEs here a better fighting chance.\"\n\n\"I do not expect to see any major changes in the tax regime although there may be some adjustments made to further reduce the income gap. There is already indication and it is evident that the government has recently been doing more work on the ageing population scenario. I would like to see that more measures be included to ensure that as Singapore grows, no one is left behind and to level up society. I expect to see this more as a social Budget than anything else.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Almost 55,000 homes with a combined value of about \u00a321 billion (S$44.11 billion) are in areas that have been subject to severe flood warnings, according to real estate broker Savills plc.\n\n\"The repercussions for property asset values are absolutely huge,\" said Hugh Fell, managing partner at property broker George F White and a former member of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors valuation board. Some homes will be \"virtually unsellable\".\n\nWhile the floods haven't posed a serious threat to London's real estate market, where home prices have gained 40 per cent since April 2009, the hardest-hit areas have been commuter towns along the Thames that have benefited the most from the housing boom, a string of historic villages along the Thames in the counties of Berkshire, Hampshire and Surrey.\n\nVirginia Water, the first town outside London where the average house price exceeded \u00a31 million, according to website Zoopla.com, has been under a severe flood warning. The town is home to the Wentworth Golf Club, set to host this year's PGA Championship, as well as properties owned by musicians Cliff Richard and Elton John.\n\nIn Hurley, a rural parish in Berkshire, the Olde Bell Inn that dates to 1135, has closed its doors until at least next Monday. Eton and Castle, home to the Eton College private school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron, has also been endangered. The 817 homes there are worth \u00a3690,000 on average.\n\n\"If I'm asked to go and value a property for the bank, I'll be asked to comment on its marketability,\" Mr Fell, whose agency is based in Durham County, said. \"If it's flooded or at future risk, it's going to be really difficult to sell. As soon as you say that, the mortgage company will say it's not suitable for lending.\"\n\nA property that can't be mortgaged loses 70 per cent of its potential buyers, Mr Fell said. A home that becomes uninsurable, and therefore only available to cash buyers, loses as much as 20 per cent of its value, according to Richard Sexton, a director at property appraisal firm e.surv.\n\nRiver levels on the Thames, though falling, remained high after more than two months of downpours, the UK Environment Agency said on its website.\n\nWater from rainfall last Friday and Saturday is filtering down to areas already inundated after the earlier storms, according to the agency.\n\nA preliminary agreement signed in June by the government and the Association of British Insurers would change the current system where homeowners in low-risk areas subsidise those living where flood danger is high.\n\nA new plan set to start next year would exclude any home built after 2009 or in the highest tax band. It also won't include leasehold properties or council homes.\n\nHomeowners in areas with a high flood risk have been able to buy insurance with no cap on its cost as part of the deal reached between insurers and the government in 2000.\n\nFlood RE, the new agreement being considered, would create a fund to provide payouts for properties that insurers won't cover. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

It opens next Friday, a week before this year's edition - which will also be the final one in its current 10-day format - kicks off. The unseen story of the annual festival, which has been running since 2005, will be told through never-before-seen photographs, posters and artist messages that have been kept in the Esplanade's archives. \"We hope to celebrate the musical moments created at Mosaic, and we invite the public - especially music fans - to reconnect with some of these experiences that they may have had at Mosaic,\" says Mr Yap.\n\nHe says that the team started by laying out photos and materials in chronological order and talking about significant memories - from special concert moments to interesting stories, artists' parties, meal gatherings, and memorable comments by the artists - from past editions of the festival.\n\nSome of these moments caught on film include jazz giants Kurt Elling and Lee Ritenour sharing a candid moment backstage before they checked out each other's show; the late saxophonist James Moody celebrating his 80th birthday at the first edition of Mosaic in 2005; and the late Miriam Makeba, a South African singer and civil rights activist who was nicknamed \"Mama Africa\", blowing the press away with her vocals when she performed in 2006.\n\nOther highlights include autographed posters of Mosaic alumni such as Japanese jazz pianist-composer Hiromi Uehara; R&B jazz crossover vocalist Joss Stone; Chicago post-rockers Tortoise; Norwegian folk duo Kings of Convenience as well as Jason Mraz, who played his first-ever show in Singapore - a rare and intimate acoustic one, no less - at the 2006 edition of Mosaic, just before he hit the big time and became a bona fide pop star. Visitors are also invited to share their Mosaic moments by leaving their memories on a wall.\n\nCurating the exhibition naturally became an emotional trip down memory lane for many who have worked on the festival for the past decade. \"It was nostalgic for the team to look through these photographs because every photo held a different memory for each of us,\" Mr Yap says. \"A real highlight for us is seeing the collective memory come together.\"\n\n'10 Years of Mosaic Moments' will run from Feb 28 to March 16 at the Esplanade. The 10th and final edition of Mosaic runs on March 7-16. For full line-up of acts and ticketing details, check\n\nmosaicmusicfestival.com\n\n/\n\n2014\n\n/\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the report said it is \"crucial\" for policymakers to monitor the trend and \"help ensure that farmers, and not absentee investors, are the future of our food system\".\n\nThe report cited three groups as being particularly influential so far in acquisitions of US farmland: The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), one of the largest pension funds in the world; Hancock Agricultural Investment Group (HAIG), part of the Hancock Natural Resource Group, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corp; and UBS Agrivest, also known as UBS Global Real Estate-Farmland and a part of the Swiss-based UBS financial services company.\n\nHAIG manages US$2.1 billion of agricultural real estate and oversees roughly 290,000 US farmland acres, according to its officials. UBS Agrivest has 113 farms totalling 183,000 acres in 15 states under management. The farms grow more than 25 different crops, according to UBS. And TIAA-CREF said that it has roughly 125,000 acres of US farmland.\n\nJames McCandless, head of UBS Global Real Estate, said that its properties are leased to local farm operators, mostly family farmers. Institutional investors are driven by a desire to diversify portfolios and achieve the steady income stream benefits associated with farmland, he said.\n\nPrices for US farmland have been rising rapidly in recent years, driven partly by increased demand for food and livestock feed for an expanding global population and by the burgeoning biofuels industry.\n\nPrices have started to stabilise but are still sharply higher than they were a year ago, particularly for fertile ground in the Midwest where corn and soya beans are grown.\n\nA report issued last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said that in the fourth quarter of 2013 farmland prices in parts of the Midwest rose 3 per cent from the third quarter. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Stately houses are set on spacious, hilly lots shaded by old trees; its village centre has gourmet restaurants and bakeries; its schools are top notch, and its 9,400 residents have a median household income of US$163,201, ranking the area roughly 40th among America's wealthiest communities.\n\nBut the hamlet has been churned up by plans to build new housing for people of much lower incomes, including black and Hispanic newcomers.\n\nA developer is offering to build 28 units of affordable rental housing with caps on family earnings, although with no income floor; families of four earning no more than roughly US$64,000 would qualify, as would poorer families, including those who receive federal vouchers.\n\nThe project would allow Chappaqua, where 91 per cent of the residents are white, to contribute to a desegregation settlement that Westchester County reached in 2009 that is being overseen by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The agreement is a condition of Westchester continuing to receive federal housing dollars after it was accused of lying about its compliance with fair-housing mandates.\n\nIt requires the county to spend US$51.6 million by 2016 to help finance the building of 750 units of moderate and low-income housing in some of Westchester's 31 largely white communities, including Rye, Larchmont, Harrison and Mount Pleasant. The county is required to aggressively market those apartments to non-whites.\n\nChappaqua Station, as the US$15 million, four-storey project is known, would be built in a weed-covered, one-third-acre patch on Hunts Lane, squeezed between Metro-North Railroad tracks, an exit ramp off the Saw Mill Parkway and a stone bridge over the tracks.\n\nThe plan has become the centre of a bitter three-year battle.\n\nRobert Greenstein, the current supervisor of New Castle, which includes the Chappaqua and Millwood hamlets, was elected in November partly because of his opposition to the project. In September, a town board led by his predecessor, Susan Carpenter, approved the project, 3-2; the new board is, in effect, trying to overturn what the previous board agreed to.\n\nThe town's building inspector and an assistant fire chief oppose the project, and the inspector told the developer, Conifer Realty, that it needs to get a state review board to grant eight variances from the state code before the project can proceed.\n\nThe Hudson Valley Board of Review was set to decide the matter last Tuesday, but only three of the five members showed up and the developer asked to adjourn the matter until April so that there would be more members present to decide.\n\nThe building inspector, William Maskiell, contends that the site is hazardous because there is insufficient width around some sides of the building for fire ladders to gain access. He and the fire chief, Russell Maitland, also argue that an arched stone overpass is too low to permit the largest fire trucks to pass.\n\nConifer, backed up by an assistant New York City fire chief who said that Chappaqua Station would be \"the safest building in town\", replied that few apartment buildings had access on all four sides.\n\nThe developer also produced a photograph showing Chappaqua's ladder fire truck sailing through the overpass and pointed out that the purported safety issue did not stop a nursery school and gymnasium from operating a short walk down Hunts Lane.\n\nMr Maskiell retorted that he was observing the exigencies of state law in demanding variances.\n\nSome residents who oppose the project have banded together in a group called Chappaqua for Responsible Affordable Housing. They said that they support the creation of moderate-income apartments but think the location is terrible because it is on a forlorn, polluted field.\n\nBill Spade, 53, an architect who said that his group supported an alternative site near the town hall, noted that the town rejected a market-rate apartment building for that site in 2006.\n\nRandolph McLaughlin, a well-known civil rights lawyer representing Conifer, said that the alternative site was a wetland and that the market-rate building was rejected not because of fire hazards but because it was too tall. He said that in an era when discriminatory language might not be publicly palatable, opponents of such projects resort to other explanations.\n\n\"It's a delaying tactic with the hope that that project doesn't get built,\" he said. \"When people start to make arguments that don't make sense, you have to ask what's the real reasons. It's clear they don't want affordable housing. The town hasn't built any in 20 years.\"\n\nA hovering question is whether low-income families would be comfortable in a community of such well-off residents. While opponents think the poorer residents might be stigmatised living between a highway and train tracks, Mr McLaughlin thinks that they would feel comfortable and that their presence would be a blessing for Chappaqua. \"To have your children raised in a town where everyone looks the same, what message are you sending?\" he asked rhetorically. \"They're going to have to live in the world. It's important to introduce children to diversity so they grow up knowing these people are just like us, no different.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Does it even matter? Regional chefs and leading local restaurateurs weigh in. By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nANYWHERE in the world, trying to rate restaurants relative to each other is going to be a prickly affair. So it didn't take long for feathers to be ruffled over David Thompson's topping the Asia's 50 Best Awards with his Bangkok restaurant Nahm earlier this week.\n\n\"The no 1 restaurant in the 50 Best Asia list belongs to a white Australian guy? I quit the org(anisation) for good reasons,\" tweeted Jay Rayner, restaurant critic for the Observer in the United Kingdom and former UK chair of the World's 50 Best Restaurant Academy of voters.\n\nHe added in a later post: \"I'm sure Nahm is lovely, and David Thompson a great chef, but the whole ranking thing does throw up peculiar results.\"\n\nWhat Mr Rayner probably also found peculiar is that the list's upper echelons are dominated by French cuisine, with 15 restaurants serving them, followed by 12 serving Japanese food and only seven specialising in Chinese cuisine.\n\nHong Kong's top restaurant, for instance, is French restaurant Amber, Japan's top restaurant is the French-influenced Narisawa and Singapore's leading name is Restaurant Andre, also a French restaurant. This year's Best Female Chef in Asia is Lan Shu of French restaurant Le Mout in Taiwan, while last year's inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award winner was French chef Paul Pairet, who serves modern French food in Shanghai.\n\nWhile Japanese chefs led the headcount, helming 12 of the restaurants listed, French chefs were the next most popular, tying with Indian chefs at seven each, followed by six Chinese chefs. Slightly over a quarter of listed restaurants are helmed by Western chefs.\n\n\"Why is the Asia's 50 Best list so Western-centric?\" asks Andrew Tjioe of Singapore's Tung Lok group and president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore. \"If Asian restaurants aren't coming up strong in Asia-focused rankings, then what chance do we have when it comes to the World's Best list or other global rankings?\n\nLike him, a few local chefs expressed surprise over the sparse inclusion of Chinese restaurants, given China's long culinary tradition and its clout in the region.\n\nBest restaurants in Asia or best Asian restaurants?\n\nYet a larger handful of chefs disagreed, dismissing the need to single out Asian chefs and Asian cuisine. \"Good food doesn't discriminate by location or culture, a chef is a chef whether he is Chinese or cooking Italian food,\" says Gaggan Anand of third-ranked molecular Indian restaurant Gaggan in Bangkok.\n\nLocal consultant chef Eric Teo adds: \"The awards are titled Asia's 50 Best Restaurants, not Asia's 50 Best Chefs, so let's keep the chefs behind the scenes and judge based on the food.\"\n\nFurthermore, as Mr Teo points out, Singaporean chefs are topping culinary competitions in Europe, while Asian chefs such as David Chang and Nobu Matsuhisa have long made waves in the US.\n\n\"People are na\u00efve to say that a Westerner can't cook Thai food. David has spent all his life in Thailand, and his head chef is Thai,\" says The Tippling Club's Ryan Clift. \"It's irrelevant and it touches on racism.\"\n\n\"I am slightly dubious about Western cooks doing Asian food myself,\" laughs Mr Thompson when told of the tweets, adding that he is not on Twitter \"and that it is Rayner's job to polarise, and he does it well\". More seriously, however, he thinks that it could be an issue of definition.\n\nA Western concept\n\nAfter all, the phenomena of food guides and food rankings can be traced back to France in the 1900s, and the very definition of a restaurant is a European notion.\n\n\"I'm having lunch at an oyster omelette place in Bangkok as we speak, it's delicious and world-class, but I am sitting on a plastic stool and eating in the sun,\" says Mr Thompson. Without any fixed criteria for the type of restaurant that diners can vote for (\"as long as it has three walls and a phone number\", World's 50 Best Awards spokesperson William Drew said in a previous interview), it is already more flexible than something like the Michelin Guide might be, Mr Thompson believes.\n\nTaciturn Asian chefs\n\nFurthermore, Asian chefs traditionally tend to shy away from the spotlight, which some observers say could have skewed results in favour of restaurants with bolder marketing efforts, which tend to be Western. \"In my time, we were all quite reserved. We didn't talk about ourselves much, we just wanted to quickly send the food out,\" says Mr Teo.\n\nWhen the Michelin Guide first launched in Japan, for example, the country's top hole-in-the-wall eateries famously turned away eager inspectors, preferring their privacy.\n\n\"The 50 Best is a media-driven list. Somebody in that restaurant has to be very vocal, only then will you get attention from voters,\" says Singapore's Mr Tjioe. \"And not everyone is as outspoken as chefs like Bo (Duangporn Songvisava from Thailand's Bo.lan) or Alvin Leung (Bo Innovation).\"\n\n\"Chefs in Asia do care for publicity,\" Ms Songvisava disagrees. \"But it may not be their first priority. Asian chefs prefer to spend their money on food and ingredients than on marketing fees.\"\n\nAnd rightly so, says Ivan Li of Family Li Imperial Cuisine, winner of this year's Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award, pointing out that chefs in mainland China don't really care for media recognition, as the media in China reciprocate with the same nonchalance. \"Being a chef is not as glamourous as it is made out to be in Western media,\" he says.\n\n\"A decade ago in Asia, if someone told his parents he was going to be a chef rather than a banker, the whole family would think he's crazy. Before, it was not a career choice, it's just something that you did,\" says Boris Yu, World's 50 Best Restaurants Academy Chair for the China and Korea region.\n\nStill, David Thompson thinks media hype shouldn't matter.\n\n\"We are not talking about PR awards, but a list voted by industry people who can cut through the gloss and froth and vote for restaurants, not just based on a press release. There are restaurants on this list that I've not even heard of,\" says Mr Thompson.\n\nA representative voice\n\nA few others have questioned whether it is a matter of getting more Asian voters on board. \"Because it is organised by a board full of Westerners and voted by a global pool of diners, perhaps they aren't the most familiar with the best local restaurants to eat in, which you can only know if you've grown up in a country or lived there a long time,\" says a local restaurant owner who did not want to be named.\n\nBut regional Academy chairs pooh-pooh that suggestion. Currently, the Academy's 936 voters are divided according to 26 regions across the globe, which have 35 voters each, including the chairperson, who nominates each of his voters. The spilt should be around one-third chefs and restaurateurs, one-third food critics and media, and one-third foodies, and 30 per cent of voters are changed yearly.\n\nOf her 35 voters in the South-east Asia (South) region last year, 23, or two-thirds, were ethnically Asian, says Leisa Tyler, Academy Chair of the Southeast Asia South region, while 80 per cent of Mr Yu's China and Korea region are Asians - a statistic that he denies any relevance.\n\n\"Invariably it's the expatriates rather than the locals who are looking harder for the hole-in-the-wall eateries in each new country they move to,\" he elaborates. In a similar vein, having more Asians on the list doesn't mean you will get more Asian restaurants, with more Asians travelling widely, \"and having fond memories of dining in Paris or London or anywhere in the world\".\n\n\"I will choose and vote for restaurants that are good, regardless of the nationality of the food and chefs. That's the best way to raise the bar of quality around the world. If I choose with certain agenda, such as by promoting Asian restaurants, I disrespect the system and it's unfair to other restaurants,\" says a Thai voter, who preferred to remain anonymous.\n\nCan't please everyone\n\nAt the end of the day, it seems, the list should just be taken for what it is - a compass to what is happening in the Asian dining scene right now - according to Ms Tyler. \"It shows that while European or Western cuisines are still very much du jour for fine dining, Asian cuisines are slowly clawing their way up there.\"\n\nWhile there are some merits, such as the growth of young, indigenous chefs and restaurants and a motivation for other Asian chefs to strive for recognition, Thailand's Ian Kittichai points out, it will never be squabble-free.\n\n\"Every restaurant guide is bound to elicit a 'What about...' reaction. What about Malaysia? Why are there no restaurants from Vietnam? You can't please everyone,\" says Tippling's Mr Clift.\n\nOr, as Mr Rayner himself more snidely sums up the controversy he sparked off in his final tweet on the matter: \"50 Best is doing the thing it's always been good at: inspiring debate about restaurants like they matter.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The asking price works out to $1,687 per sq ft per plot ratio.\n\nThe site has a potential gross floor area of 23,710 sq ft, which will allow developers to build up to 32 apartment units averaging 800 sq ft, said CBRE.\n\nAlan Cheong, the director for research and consultancy at Savills Singapore, thinks the proposed sale of the apartments hits a sweet spot, as it would be harder to get all residents on board in a larger development.\n\nAlex Chow, a manager for investment properties with CBRE, said the location of the site just opposite Novena MRT station weighs in its favour.\n\nThe development is also near Velocity @ Novena Square, Square 2 and United Square shopping centres, and is also in the neighbourhood of Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), Anglo-Chinese School (Junior), St Joseph's Institution Junior and CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh).\n\nMr Chow also listed the site's freehold tenure and proximity to the upcoming Health City Novena integrated healthcare complex as plus points.\n\nHe said: \"Singapore's vibrant healthcare and medical tourism industries will continue to drive demand for properties situated near healthcare hubs.\"\n\nLast year had brought significantly more en bloc sales of commercial and industrial sites, a trend expected to carry through this year.

I think to a certain extent the market still believes that the M&A (merger and acquisition) angle is still around the corner.

This is a significant increase from the 38 IPO deals worth US$10.45 billion in 2012.\n\nThe top 10 largest Chinese IPOs last year were listed in Hong Kong, with China Everbright Bank topping the list with its US$3.2 billion IPO. Hong Kong's raft of mega Chinese offerings signals a revival of interest in the city as a premier venue for such deals, observers said.\n\nMore mega Chinese listings are expected in Hong Kong this year. Shanghai-listed China CNR Corp, one of China's biggest train-makers, plans to raise about US$1.5 billion, while China Railway Materials is looking at a US$1 billion deal. Beijing Automotive Group Co, which makes vehicles with Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co, is planning to launch an IPO worth more than US$1 billion.\n\nNew Chinese listings also staged a rebound on US bourses. A total of eight companies launched their IPOs on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq last year worth US$918 million, up from two IPOs which raised an aggregate US$166 million in 2012.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX), on the other hand, was left high and dry where Chinese IPOs were concerned. The dry spell, which started in 2011, extended into last year with no new Chinese IPO launched here. Since the fallout of accounting scandals involving Chinese companies, Chinese IPOs in Singapore have dwindled from 25 deals in 2006 to just seven in 2010.\n\nSim Yong Nam, Phillip Securities's head of corporate finance, noted that the issue of pricing was still affecting the supply of Chinese IPOs here. And while it was a minority of the Chinese-listed companies that got into trouble, \"these have reduced investors' interest and demand for Chinese IPOs\", he said.\n\nUnder the new direct listing framework agreed between SGX and the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Chinese companies are allowed to list without the need to incorporate a new holding company outside China for the listing. \"But unless the market valuations of Chinese IPOs in Singapore catches up with those in Hong Kong, the supply of Chinese IPOs in Singapore will be affected,\" Mr Sim said.\n\nStill, many Chinese companies are hungry for capital, and they are making a bee-line for the Chinese mainland and overseas markets. The US market is expected to receive more Chinese IPOs this year. This includes the highly anticipated IPO by China's largest e-commerce group, Alibaba - set to be 2014's blockbuster IPO. China's largest online clothing retailer, VANCL, and popular e-commerce company JD.com are also among those working towards a US listing.\n\n\"Working in the US's favour is (the fact) that companies seeking to list there (that is, Nasdaq) are not required to provide a three-year profitability track record. So, for start-ups and new growth companies, going to the US becomes a natural choice,\" noted David Suen, head of equity capital markets for JPMorgan Asia ex-Japan. \"The US still has an edge with Internet and technology companies as well as high-growth start-ups that are smaller in size, given the market's deep knowledge of the sector and its desire to look for growth.\"\n\nHe added that JPMorgan was recently seeing technology companies planning to list in Hong Kong because of the narrowing valuation gap between the two markets.\n\nHong Kong was a key beneficiary of the IPO ban on the mainland last year, as the hundreds of firms waiting for an IPO approval from the CSRC were targeted by Hong Kong underwriters and issue managers.\n\n\"The slowdown of the approval process in China's A-share market had prompted some listing candidates to opt for the Hong Kong market last year,\" said Mr Suen. \"But now that the A-share IPO market is re-opened, many are again considering listing in the A-share market.\"\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers, a record 300 new A-share IPOs are expected to be launched this year, possibly raising as much as 250 billion yuan (US$41.3 billion, S$51.9 billion).\n\nIPO listing in China is expected to become more market-driven following CSRC's directive last November to shift the system from an approval-based to a registration-based one that focuses on information disclosure. Under the previous system, multiple reviews from the regulator often resulted in years of waiting for listings prospects.\n\nMr Yan noted that there would be \"a polarisation of valuations\", as market forces played a greater role in the IPO market. \"The listing requirements for new listings will become less stringent as underwriters and issuers have a bigger say in IPO launches,\" he added. \"Funds will exercise greater discretion and flow into quality companies.\"\n\nThose with a higher-growth, asset-light strategy and are in sectors favoured by the government, such as healthcare and medical devices, are likely to command higher valuations, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In 2012, the Singapore business posted income of more than US$2 billion.\n\nStanChart is a major bank in Singapore, with 19 branches, seven priority centres and 31 automated teller machines.\n\nThe bank is one of the top three employers in Singapore's financial services industry with more than 7,600 employees here.\n\nLast October, Mr Ferguson disclosed that the group pumped in S$2.4 billion capital for the local incorporation, above the minimum S$1.5 billion because the bank's \"balance sheet is bigger than the minimum required\".\n\nHe said local subsidiarisation further demonstrates the bank's commitment to Singapore, and its confidence in the future of the Republic and its position as a leading global financial centre.\n\nBut in recent months, the group has stumbled.\n\nIt announced a shake- up last November to streamline operations and sharpen its strategy as it said 2013 was not expected to repeat the past 10 years of record profits given higher compliance cost, losses in South Korea and slowdown in Asia, its main markets.\n\nIts businesses in Hong Kong and Africa continue to grow at a double-digit rate but income is flat in Singapore because of margin pressures and lower mortgage volumes.\n\nLast month, it said the wholesale banking and consumer banking units will be combined from April 1 under Mike Rees, who will be appointed deputy group chief executive, reporting to Peter Sands, group chief executive.\n\nIt also said Steve Bertamini, group executive director and chief executive consumer banking, will step down from the board at the end of next month. Richard Meddings, group executive director and group finance director, will also go by the end of June.\n\nIn early December, StanChart Singapore stunned customers when it disclosed that clients' data had been stolen. Last February's monthly statements of 647 private bank clients were found on a computer belonging to alleged \"Messiah\" hacker James Raj Arokiasamy.\n\nMr Ferguson is not new to controversy, nor to the Middle East.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report last April, he was on the cusp of being appointed as the new chief executive of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi in 2012 but the offer was rescinded when Standard Chartered hit the headlines for breaching US sanctions against Iran.\n\nMr Ferguson, who led the bank's Americas operations in 2006, had sent an internal email warning of \"catastrophic reputational damage\" over its dealings with Iran. He was concerned with the bank's slow reaction to regulators' concern over its dealings with Iran, and the email was intended to spur it into a response.\n\nThe dealings with Iran resulted in a \u00a3415 million (S$874 million) fine from US regulators.\n\nMr Ferguson, 50, who is British, became a Singapore citizen in 2010.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Main creditor Korea Development Bank (KDB) and other banks had already agreed to inject about 2.7 trillion won into STX Offshore last year.\n\nSTX Offshore is part of a batch of affiliates of the shipping conglomerate STX Group, like holding company STX Corp, that applied for creditor rescue last year after being hit by falling ship prices since the global financial crisis.\n\nMany of the loss-making orders reviewed in the latest round of due diligence have since been cancelled or renegotiated, one source said. The people familiar with the matter were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nDespite creditors' rescue attempts, STX Offshore is expected to be delisted after March as its debt outweighed capital by 1.4 trillion won as at the third quarter last year. Trading in the stock has been halted since earlier this month.\n\nDue diligence is now complete. The chief executive of KDB, Hong Kyttaek, said last week that the process of selling some STX assets is expected to move to the next stage as early as next month. Credit Suisse is advising on the sale of two remaining European units of STX Offshore.\n\nThe Finnish government bought a majority stake in ice-breaking technology company Aker Arctic for nine million euros from STX Finland in December.\n\nSouth Korea's largest bulk shipper, Pan Ocean, is expected to be put on the block this year as its operations are normalising quickly, Mr Hong said.

But that demand is waning as prices climb and mortgage rates rise. An analysis by the Mortgage Bankers Association found that loan applications for home purchases have slipped nearly 20 per cent in the past four months compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nFirst-time buyers, the bedrock of the housing market, are not stepping up to fill the void. They have accounted for nearly a third of home purchases over the past year, well below the historical norm, industry figures show. The trend has alarmed some housing specialists, who suspect that student loan debt is partly to blame. That debt has tripled from a decade earlier, to more than US$1 trillion, while wages for young college graduates have dropped.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

Spain's Expansion newspaper reported the offer was worth \u00a3800 million (S$1.68 billion).\n\nFerrovial, which is the largest stakeholder in HAH with a 25 per cent share, has been on the hunt to strengthen its airport business as it seeks to diversify further from its construction business.\n\nThe firm has discussed a joint bid for the three airports with at least two Australian funds, Macquarie and Industry Funds Management (IFM), Expansion said, citing sources.\n\nUnlike Heathrow, none of the three airports are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\n\nHeathrow complained last month about \"draconian\" plans for a price cap on airlines, which it said would limit its rate of return on capital investment to an \"unsustainable\" 5.35 per cent.\n\nBy contrast, the lack of CAA constraints on the far smaller airports of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton would allow Ferrovial to focus on profits.\n\n\"Ferrovial will see its exposure to regulatory risk reduced,\" said Pablo Ortiz, equity analyst at Spanish brokerage Interdin Bolsa. \"This is very important because you can deploy freely the strategy that you want. To (be able to) increase return on equity as much as you can: it's a huge difference.\"\n\nHAH would also benefit from a deal as it would be able to focus solely on Heathrow, Mr Ortiz said. \"Management at Heathrow requires all the devotion you can address,\" he said. \"I think management want to focus on that front, and also the issue of the third runway is very important. It's a second front that management need to handle.\"\n\nThe prospect of a third runway at Heathrow has been highly contentious. Supporters say the airport is overstretched and call for the UK to be better connected to other economic hubs, but critics say the runway would bring noise and air pollution.\n\nThe offer for the three airports marks a turnaround in Ferrovial's strategy after years of selling off its airport stakes to cut debt. It took control of HAH, then called BAA, in 2006 in a \u00a310.3 billion, highly leveraged deal but has since gradually reduced its holding.\n\nLast year it sold an 8.65 per cent stake in Heathrow to British pension fund Universities Superannuation Scheme. Now diversification has replaced debt reduction, as the company tries to strengthen its airport business in an attempt to branch out from Spain's floundering domestic construction sector.\n\nIn December, Sky News reported that Ferrovial had said it wanted to buy the three airports.\n\nThe deal comes as high-quality infrastructure investments, sought after by pension funds for their long-term, low-risk nature, have grown scarce. Investor demand has risen as forced corporate sell-offs decline thanks to buoyant debt markets.\n\n\"This does show significant remaining appetite for airport stakes,\" said Simon Morris at aviation advisory firm ICF International, adding that good-quality airport stakes were now in short supply.\n\nAnalysts said a US$1.3 billion price for the deal implied a multiple of 13 times the three airports' estimated 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda).\n\n\"This in our view would represent a full price, arguably with limited upside in terms of synergies or efficiency as Ferrovial has already been managing these assets via HAH,\" said Juan Carlos Calvo at Espirito Santo investment bank. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

But as the yearly deluge of pre-Budget recommendations and petitions shows, balancing the needs and wants of various groups - and deciding how best to keep a surplus - is getting ever more tricky.\n\nAs Singapore's population ages rapidly and healthcare costs rise, as redistribution to ensure \"inclusive growth\" gains urgency, and as companies seek help to ride out economic restructuring by being more productive, a marked increase in public spending looks inevitable.\n\nThe question is: how will this be financed? Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted this in the last National Day Rally speech - the major political speech in Singapore's calendar - and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will no doubt address this too, in his Budget speech on Friday.\n\n\"Redistribution and social spending costs will likely be borne first by tapping returns on the fiscal reserves, followed by higher wealth taxes, with higher income taxes for the rich as a last resort,\" said Citi economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan. While the avenues to raise funds are open, each comes with trade-offs.\n\nChoosing to raise the current ceiling on the amount of net investment returns contribution (NIRC) the government can take into its Budget, or even raise the NIRC nearer to the current cap, means less is squirelled away into the reserves. That trade-off is seen as the least costly one.\n\n\"With greater contribution from the fiscal coffers, redistribution need not be a zero-sum game between workers and businesses,\" the Citi economists pointed out.\n\nFor instance, raising the top personal income tax or wealth taxes would fit well with last year's moves towards a more progressive tax system, benefiting the average worker. But it could dent Singapore's attractiveness to top talent, which is in turn key to global companies' investment decisions, partners from the Big Four tax firms say.\n\nBeyond balancing the Budget, the social and economic policy changes being sought are at times at odds with one another.\n\nThe combination of rising healthcare costs and a rapidly ageing population has led the labour movement to call for the CPF contribution rate to be restored for older workers. But this means added costs for employers, at a time when economic restructuring is pushing wages and rents higher.\n\nWhich is also why trade associations and business chambers are asking for a halt in the stiffening of the foreign manpower curbs, which have been made more severe four years in a row.\n\nHigher levies and stricter quotas were put in place to wean companies off their reliance on cheaper foreign labour, and to push them to raise productivity. But some businesses have found that these measures hamper productivity - such as when they are unable to renew the work passes for experienced or skilled foreign employees.\n\nEconomists, such as DBS economist Irvin Seah, reckon that the tightening will continue, but in a more targeted fashion. He expects further tweaks in the mid-skilled segment, perhaps sector-specific ones, to cater to the rapidly rising number of Singaporean professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).\n\nThis would be in line with what the government has been saying about ensuring a strong Singaporean core to the workforce. Yet some business groups have said that uncertainty over their ability to hire skilled workers may affect future investment decisions in Singapore.\n\nBusinesses, in particular, will be keen to see how the government chooses to balance these priorities on Budget Day.\n\nAs Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan said at BT's recent Budget Roundtable: \"This Budget, in my view, is a lot about connecting the dots. We already have the dots: a good surplus, the goal to get productivity, the goal to raise wages. So, we go back to kindergarten, to connect the dots, and get that nice picture.\"\n\nGo to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/SGBudget-2014\n\nfor BT's pre-Budget features\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's standard advice in investing, and it makes sense. After all, if you've salted money away for a serious purpose like retiring or buying a house or paying for a child's education, you really don't want to focus on how the stock market has done today or on what it might do tomorrow. You need a longer perspective.\n\nBut there's a fundamental problem with this otherwise sound guidance: How long is the long view? And what do you do if the basis of your long-term thinking changes radically from year to year?\n\nThese aren't just theoretical questions. Because of a quirk in the calendar, such a cognitive shift has happened recently. And it suggests that the long view needs to be much longer than five years.\n\nConsider the five-year annualised returns of the stock market, which have undergone an astonishing improvement over the course of just one calendar year - from a net loss in the five years that ended in 2012 to a hefty double-digit annualised gain in the five years that ended in 2013.\n\nThese five-year numbers often colour the thinking of not just ordinary investors but sophisticated strategists as well. Open a year-end report for your 401(k) or IRA, and you may now see the 2013 numbers for your own investments and for comparable benchmarks. Along with more recent returns, those 2013 five-year returns are appearing on financial websites, and in mutual fund reports and brokerage letters. And they are used by consultants for pension funds and other institutional investors in formulating asset-allocation and risk-management strategies.\n\nYet these five-year perspectives are very changeable. At the end of 2012, stocks' five-year record was dismal; now, it looks fabulous. What's remarkable is that three of the years in each of those five-year records are exactly the same.\n\n\"This is an anomaly in market returns that's occurred because of the calendar, and the extreme moves in the market that have taken place since the financial crisis, and it can be very misleading if you don't look at it carefully,\" said David Kelley, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Funds.\n\nBefore considering what it might mean, let's look at how such a big change occurred in the five-year data. The numbers tell the story, if you examine them carefully.\n\nAt the end of 2012, the annualised five-year return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, without dividends, was a negative 0.6 per cent. That means that if your portfolio mirrored the index, you lost some of your money (although, to be sure, dividends would have given you a small annualised gain of 1.7 per cent).\n\nThe main reason for these depressing figures was that the market hadn't fully recovered from the devastation of 2008 and early 2009. That period was a nightmare for the markets and the economy. In 2008 alone, the S&P 500 dropped 38.5 per cent, without dividends. After such losses, many investors came to an understandable conclusion: that the market was an inhospitable place. And they walked - or ran - away from it.\n\nBut at the end of 2013, if you relied solely on the five-year trailing numbers, you would have had reason to kick yourself for being out of the stock market. That's because the annualised five-year return had climbed to 15.4 per cent without dividends, and 17.9 per cent with them. If you had invested in the index over those five years, you would have more than doubled your money.\n\nWhy did the five-year return change so much in just one year? First and foremost, on Dec 31, 2013, the entire ghastly year of 2008 was effectively wiped off the books, from the standpoint of the five-year return. That tally started near a market low in 2009, and the results of 2013 became part of the record, too. And 2013 was spectacular, with a gain of 29.6 per cent for the S&P 500 without dividends, and 32.4 per cent when you include them.\n\nIn short, the five-year view in 2012 and 2013 produced two very different narratives. The view backward at the end of 2012 was a cautionary tale about the risks of stock investing. The five-year view just one year later was all about the rewards of risk-taking.\n\nWhich one should you rely upon for guidance?\n\nNeither is enough if you're trying to be a long-term investor. A much longer time period seems in order. For example, the stock market has tended to outperform the bond market in the past. (That's probably because investors demand a premium for the greater risk involved in stock investing, according to prevailing theory.) This has been true, on average, for many decades - but it wasn't true during the financial crisis. In order to count on a long-term trend like this, you may need to stay in the markets for 20 years or more - maybe for a lifetime, or even several lifetimes. That may not be easy to accept.\n\nJames W Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, happened to drop by last week from Minneapolis, and we discussed some of these issues.\n\n\"The sad truth,\" he said, \"is that over shorter periods, there's really no certainty that the market will behave the way it has in the past - which is why you need to stay very broadly diversified in your investments and why most people need to go for the really, really long term.\"\n\nFive-year returns may tell you what worked in the past, but the conclusions to be drawn from that may be counterintuitive.\n\n\"Success means market prices have already risen,\" Mr Paulsen said. \"When prices are high, it may mean that you should be looking for something else.\"\n\nProfessional strategists live in a world where such price distinctions are crucial. But for the long-term investor, basic diversification and asset allocation may be enough, he said.\n\n\"If you follow the basics, that's 80 per cent of it,\" Mr Paulsen said. \"Guys like me are trying to improve your returns for what's left after that.\"\n\nAt least this much is clear: the long view may need to be very long indeed. Sometimes a five-year span isn't nearly enough. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM", "images": []}

CBUC will retain a 10 per cent stake in CCIP. The purchase is expected to be completed by March 25.\n\nCXP expects to finance its purchase of CCIP with cash and bank borrowings.\n\nCCIP owns and operates a multi-purpose break bulk port facility, located next to CXP. It became operational in November 2012. The net tangible asset value of CCIP based on unaudited financial statements as at Dec 31, 2013, is 367.9 million yuan.\n\nJiangsu Changshu Economic Development Group, a local state-owned entity, owns CBUC.

A closed hearing is scheduled for today.\n\nThe 65-year-old Malaysian has also been sued by Interactive Brokers LLC after he failed to pay for a S$26.5 million shortfall in his margin account. The Connecticut-based online brokerage firm accused Mr Neo and seven others of a \"pump and dump\" plan to manipulate shares of the three companies, according to a November lawsuit seeking to freeze S$79 million of their assets.\n\nAt least two of the eight defendants are seeking to set aside the freeze, claiming the brokerage was involved in a \"commission-generating scheme\", which it denies. The eight haven't otherwise commented on the claims and Mr Neo didn't reply to four e-mails and return two phone calls left with Blumont seeking comment.\n\nThe claims relate to Mr Neo's private share holdings, Blumont said in an e-mailed response. The company said that it will update shareholders when appropriate.\n\nAlexander Molyneux was appointed to succeed Mr Neo as Blumont chairman pending the purchase of a stake in the company announced in October. The acquisition has been deferred and Mr Molyneux remains chairman designate, Blumont said this month.\n\nShares in Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold fell at least 87 per cent over three days in October, wiping out US$6.9 billion in market value. The sudden declines after reaching record highs in the past year prompted Singapore regulators to probe stock activities, propose tighter trading rules and add circuit breakers to protect investors from excessive price swings.\n\nThe slump also triggered at least a dozen lawsuits and a 20 per cent decline in Singapore equity trading in the last quarter of 2013 as brokerages curbed investments in riskier small-cap stocks. The three companies have said that they don't know what caused the share price declines. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

This particular answer choice did not exist in the 2011 survey.\n\nThe most popular reason provided in 2013, however, was the lack of time to watch pay-TV, with 53.6 per cent of respondents claiming to be time- strapped.\n\nEven so, the proportion of households opting out of pay-TV services declined in the survey, with only 36.5 per cent in this category, compared with 41.7 per cent in 2011. Households with dual set-top boxes from StarHub and mio TV also grew, from 5.3 per cent to 9 per cent.\n\nWhere pay-TV services were concerned, the No 1 concern appeared to be reception or transmission issues, with 26 per cent of respondents indicating that these were key concerns with their pay-TV service over the past year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Everbest mainly distributes, in China, electronic components of New York Stock Exchange-listed company Kemet Corporation. Its founder had undertaken to provide a net profit guarantee.\n\nSecondly, WE Holdings said that its subsidiary WE Resources has entered into two memoranda of understanding (MOUs) on the supply, sale and purchase of iron ore fines and iron ore lumps.\n\nThe agreements were entered with Malaysian miner ATR Natural Resources, Shanghai-based trading company Pacific Treasure International and China company China-Base Ningbo Foreign Trades Co.\n\nUsing various assumptions, the contract value of each MOU amounts to US$16.8 million a year. The company said that the MOUs marked its first resources-related contracts and \"places the company in a favourable position as an iron ore trading intermediary between Malaysia and China\".\n\nThirdly, the company said that five of its shareholders, including chairman and chief executive officer Terence Tea, have each provided an irrevocable undertaking to subscribe to all their rights and warrants entitlements, with three undertaking to make excess applications. The cumulative undertaking is 326 million rights shares with warrants, amounting to around $5 million.\n\nIn January, the company had proposed to raise between $12.7 million and $39.4 million to help pay for a proposed Myanmar acquisition and fund the expansion of its coal business, with the balance used for working capital.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding the one-off Australand divestment loss (CapitaLand divested a 20 per cent stake in Australand in November while retaining a 39.12 per cent stake), net profit would have inched up 0.4 per cent to $263.7 million.\n\nRevenue for the three months ended December dipped 2.3 per cent, from $1.11 billion to $1.09 billion. This was due to the Australand divestment and lower revenue from Singapore development projects, mitigated by an increase in revenue from the group's development projects in China and Vietnam, as well as higher rental revenue from its shopping malls.\n\nIn Q4, revenue from CapitaLand China, which is recognised on a completion basis, more than doubled to $292.8 million, as more apartment units were delivered to homebuyers.\n\nMeanwhile, CapitaLand Singapore's revenue was 37 per cent lower at $158.9 million, mainly due to lower contribution from Latitude and Urban Resort, as well as the absence of rental contribution from Technopark@Chai Chee which was divested during the quarter. This was partially mitigated by revenue recognition for Bedok Residences.\n\nCommenting on the property cooling measures introduced in Singapore, Mr Wen said: \"I think the government's stated objective with all these measures is to achieve a sustainable, stable property market. Now that they've managed the demand side quite well, our hope is that they can relax the time frame for developers to sell their units.\n\n\"If the government can give us a longer time to supply according to market conditions, the market will reach equilibrium in a less volatile manner.\"\n\nDespite headwinds in the sector, Arthur Lang, group chief financial officer, said there is no need to have any impairments on CapitaLand Singapore's residential projects at the moment.\n\n\"Assuming prices and demand drop as per what market consensus has shown . . . the prices that we have transacted and expect to transact are, even in the stress scenario, above the break-even prices that we have,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, the value of CapitaLand's Singapore residential inventory stock (about 1,600 units in total including joint ventures), is less than 10 per cent of its total assets.\n\nAdded Mr Wen: \"And for projects that are already launched . . . we have reached a self-financing status cash-flow wise. That means that proceeds for the units that have been sold is enough to service our loans and also pay for construction. So we are not under any financial stress to rush out and dump our products.\"\n\nIn 2013, sales of residential units in Singapore nearly doubled with a total of 1,260 units sold amounting to a sales value of $2.44 billion.\n\nIn FY2013, net profit dropped 8.7 per cent to $849.8 million while revenue rose 20.5 per cent to $3.98 billion. Excluding the one-off Australand divestment loss, net profit would have risen 4.3 per cent to $970.6 million.\n\nOn the back of operating profit after tax and minority interest (PATMI) jumping 42.9 per cent to $527.7 million, the board has proposed a dividend of 8 cents per share.\n\nWhile the full year's operating PATMI is below consensus expectations, the operating turnaround was stellar on the China residential and retail business, noted Barclays analyst Tricia Song.\n\nIn China, 3,009 residential units at a sales value of $1.12 billion were sold. Including CapitaLand Township projects, 7,688 units were sold, an increase of 16 per cent year on year. Target contracted sales are expected to grow 30 per cent in 2014, while target handover is similar at 8,000 units (60 per cent of this has been sold).\n\nIn Q4, earnings per share was 3.4 cents, versus 6.2 cents a year ago. In FY2013, EPS was 20 cents, compared with 21.9 cents the previous year.\n\nCapitaLand's counter fell 3 cents to end trading yesterday at $2.91.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Fifty- four officers were injured and more than $650,000 worth of damage was inflicted on government vehicles and equipment.\n\nIn his opening statement yesterday at the Subordinate Courts, Senior State Counsel David Khoo sketched out the timeline of the inquiry, which will look into how the riot erupted and how it was managed by responding ground forces as well as the circumstances which led to the riot. The COI will also examine whether existing measures to tackle such incidents in areas where foreign workers congregate - with Geylang being flagged as another area of concern - are sufficient.\n\nThe four-member committee is headed by former Supreme Court Judge, G Pannir Selvam. The other members are former police commissioner Tee Tua Ba, former president of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) John De Payva and chairman of West Coast Citizens' Consultative Committee Andrew Chua Thiam Chwee.\n\nThe court heard yesterday that Mr Kumaravelu, a construction worker, alighted from the bus voluntarily after being asked to do so by the bus coordinator, Wong Geck Woon, on the night of Dec 8. One of the workers had told Madam Wong that Mr Kumaravelu appeared to be drunk and had pulled down his bermudas on the bus, which ferries the workers back to their dormitory.\n\n\"In addressing the many theories propagated by foreign media alleging the deceased had been manhandled or thrust off the bus, I would say only that we shall, in the course of this inquiry, adduce evidence showing these allegations to be unfounded,\" said Mr Khoo.\n\nThe court was also shown a video yesterday, extracted from cameras installed on the bus, which showed Mr Kumaravelu running after the bus as it moved along Tekka Lane. While running, he fell forward and under the left front wheel of the bus, which crushed him and resulted in immediate fatal injuries. An angry mob soon gathered around the bus, breaking windows and hurling projectiles while trying to get to Madam Wong and bus driver Lee Kim Huat.\n\nMichael Tay, an independent forensic scientist who was engaged by the police to carry out investigations, was the first witness on the stand yesterday. He noted that Mr Kumaravelu could have fallen for a number of reasons, including the wet road surface on that rainy evening, a loss of balance or the deceased's intoxicated state, which could have affected his motor skills and judgment.\n\nThe toxicology report showed that the deceased had 217 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, a level at which an average individual could expect to be \"moderately to severely intoxicated\", pathologist Marian Wang said.\n\nDr Tay acknowledged a point made by COI chairman Mr Selvam, who said that the bus driver could have potentially seen Mr Kumaravelu running alongside the bus for a number of seconds through the bus' camera footage, but also told the court that there were other cognitive demands on the 55-year-old bus driver. This included some 20-30 pedestrians milling about, bright external lights shining at the rear and sides of the bus as well as the wet glass panel of the door.\n\nAside from its own interviews with some of the repatriated workers and visits to foreign worker dormitories here, the COI will hear from the Ministry of Manpower and dormitory operator Willy Ng. Other witnesses will include residents of Little India, stakeholders such as shopkeepers, the Land Transport Authority and transport service providers.\n\nBus co-ordinator Madam Wong, bus driver Mr Lee and Deputy Commissioner of Police T Raja Kumar are expected to take the stand today.\n\nThe COI, which is meant to be fact-finding - rather than determine civil or criminal liability - will provide a report of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Minister for Home Affairs within six months of the inquiry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

New airlines are popping up all over Asia, including some exotically named Japanese carriers Vanilla Air and Peach Aviation.\n\nThe expo's US$32 billion of orders, while modest compared with a Gulf carrier-inspired US$206 billion splurge in Dubai three months earlier, highlighted the emergence of the latest class of airlines serving intra-Asian routes that are starting to criss-cross the continent.\n\nStart-ups such as Air Costa are jostling for position with new units at older carriers that range from ANA Holdings' Vanilla and Thai Airways International's Smile division to the Tiger brand of Singapore Airlines.\n\n\"The Asia-Pacific is unique because of the number of cities with more than a million people,\" Robert Martin, chief executive officer of Singapore-based aircraft lessor BOC Aviation, said in an interview at the show. \"In China there's more than 100, India has more than 50. The number of city pairs we'll have in the long term will be phenomenal.\"\n\nClose to half the world's air traffic growth will involve Asian routes over the next 20 years, Boeing marketing chief Randy Tinseth said in Singapore, with carriers from the region requiring 12,820 more aircraft, or 36 per cent of the global total. Competitor Airbus puts the figure at 11,000 planes.\n\nAsia's exploding growth, which is spurring the foundation of new airlines every few months, contrasts with the mature markets of the US and Europe, where over-capacity has led to consolidation and fewer carriers for planemakers to sell to.\n\nEven the Persian Gulf's flood of wide-body orders is inspired by Asian economies, with Dubai-based Emirates, Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi and Qatar Airways vying to build hubs for long-haul links with Europe, the Americas and Africa.\n\nIn Singapore, smaller models used to provide point-to-point links predominated. Air Costa, based in Vijayawada in southern India and packing planes 87 per cent full after three months of operations, ordered 50 Embraer jets worth US$2.9 billion.\n\nTwo-year-old VietJet, based in Hanoi, signed for 63 Airbus A320s with a sticker price of US$6.4 billion, while Nok Airlines Public Co announced a US$1.45 billion commitment for eight Boeing 737s and Bangkok Airways bought six ATR 72 turboprops.\n\n\"The centre of gravity has shifted to Asia,\" Norm Liu, chief executive officer of General Electric Co's world-leading leasing arm, said in an interview in Singapore. GE made its first deal in Myanmar last week with an accord to supply 10 Boeing 737s to Myanma Airways.\n\nCompetition is increasing. About 15 low-fare carriers started flying in the Asia-Pacific region over the past decade, according to the International Air Transport Association. And these make up for more than half of the seat capacity available in South-east Asia, surging from about 3 per cent a decade ago, according to Capa Centre for Aviation.\n\nNot all budget carriers thrived in the region. Indonesia's Adam Skyconnection Airlines ceased operations after running out of funds to keep flying, while Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, which tried to take on Cathay Pacific on long-haul flights, collapsed in 2008 after incurring losses.\n\nAirAsia X, the long-haul unit of Asia's largest low-cost carrier AirAsia, dropped services to London and Paris in 2012, three years after it introduced flights to Europe.\n\nRegional routes are driving the expansion in Asia as economic growth put more people on planes from India to Indonesia, many for the first time. Start-ups and established carriers develop a range of business models to tap both the newly affluent and high-income frequent travellers. \"We're seeing the gamut,\" said engine maker Pratt & Whitney's Mary Ellen Jones, who recently became sales chief for Asia after previously covering the US. \"There's a multitude of airlines from the little guys with a couple of planes to the major carriers. The vibe and energy level is high.\"\n\nPratt's haul at the show included engines for 15 A320neos ordered by Bank of China-owned BOC, plus the Air Costa planes.\n\nSingapore Airlines illustrates the trend toward separate brandings aimed at specific markets, according to GE's Mr Liu.\n\nOnce simply a network operator, \"now they have Silk Air for regional, Tiger in low-cost short-haul and Scoot for long-haul,\" he said. \"We see the same with All Nippon, which has Peach, and Japan Airlines with Jetstar Japan.\"\n\nIndia alone has \"huge potential\", with just one per cent of its 1.2 billion of population so far travelling by air, Embraer's Mark Dunnachie, head of commercial aviation for the Asia-Pacific, said after the Air Costa deal. \"And we see something similar in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.\"\n\nGrowth is evident in support services, as well as aircraft sales, with Airbus last week joining with Singapore Airlines to establish a pilot training school and securing a 15-year-deal to provide support for Thai Smile's fleet of 20 A320s. While Boeing provided 56 per cent of the 5,000-plus planes flying in Asia today, the backlog shows Airbus with 69 per cent of future narrow-body deliveries and a 53 per cent share on wide-bodies.\n\nOrders placed in Singapore barely scratched the surface, according to Tony Fernandes, CEO of AirAsia, which is vying with Indonesia's Lion Mentari Airlines and Qantas Airways affiliate Jetstar Airways for discount supremacy.\n\nWith the continent's three billion people served by a fleet less than half the size of that in the US, which has a population of 315 million, the days of an Asian carrier with more than 1,000 jetliners can't be far off, Mr Fernandes reckons.\n\nAirAsia already has about 140 A320 planes in operation plus 335 on order; Lion Air has a 105-strong fleet and a mammoth 650 Airbus and Boeing narrow-bodies yet to come. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

At 1,275 rupiah per CAS share, it is at an implied premium of 50.1 per cent over the one-day volume weighted average price, according to a group presentation on the acquisition.\n\nSATS entered into the sales-and-purchase agreement with sellers Puncak Cemerlang BV and Bintang Nusantara Ltd on Feb 19, and expects to complete the acquisition on Feb 20, 2014.\n\n\"We already have a strong partnership with CAS through our joint venture, PT Jasa Angkasa Semesta Tbk (PT JAS). With this transaction, we will work closely with the management of the CAS group to accelerate its growth in the same way we have with PT JAS over the last 10 years,\" said SATS's president and CEO Alexander Hungate.\n\nWith a 30-year track record in the business through its subsidiary JAS, CAS operates in 23 cities and 17 airports across Indonesia. Based on JAS's 2012 aviation statistics, its subsidiaries catered to 15 million passengers, handled 55,000 flights and 254,000 tonnes of cargo.\n\nMr Hungate said CAS offered an attractive investment opportunity in the group's core business and expected the acquisition to \"generate sustainable value for our customers, employees and shareholders as Indonesia continues to grow\".\n\nCAS made a pre-tax profit of 105 billion rupiah for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013.\n\nManagement said the purchase is not expected to have a significant impact on earnings (according to Q3 FY2013 EPS of 16.6 cents, which remains unchanged after the transaction), but will reduce group net tangible asset (NTA) per share to 90.7 cents from 100.5 cents (according to Q3 FY2013 NTA).\n\nCAS comprises five key subsidiaries which cover the full spectrum of food solutions and gateway services. These include airfreight handling; ramp handling and passenger services through PT Jasa Angkasa; aircraft line maintenance and technical ramp services through PT Jas Aero; institutional catering through PT Cardig Anugrah Sarana Catering; and airline catering and facilities management services.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But drive an hour inland and the agricultural giant Cargill is racing to finish a cocoa bean processing plant, while a large instant noodle factory is running full tilt to meet the demand for convenience food from Indonesia's large and growing middle class.\n\n\"We're having quite a tough time keeping up,\" said Tjun Sulestio, a general manager of the noodle factory, run by PT Suprama. The contrast in many emerging markets between signs of a looming currency crisis and strong domestic demand is visible around the world. Stock markets and currencies have fallen in recent months in places such as Buenos Aires, Argentina; Jakarta, Indonesia; Manila, Philippines; and Istanbul, as investors have worried that weaker Chinese growth and a US Federal Reserve that is pumping out fewer dollars will cause a global stumble in many developing nations.\n\nLike limbo dancers struggling to shuffle under a low bar before standing upright again, emerging markets must shuffle along under weak commodity exports and capital outflows before they can recover their balance and let strong domestic demand for products such as cars, electronics and instant noodles carry their economies forward again. The question is whether their consumers and businesses will continue to spend, or whether international troubles will spill into domestic economies in ways they cannot control.\n\n\"We don't want that bar to go too low,\" said Jakob Sorensen, chairman of the European Business Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia. \"The lower it goes, the harder it will be.\"\n\nThere are reasons for optimism. Many stock markets in emerging economies have rebounded in the past week. International problems have not yet caused the bank runs and large-scale flight of international investors that made previous crises so severe, such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. Central banks in emerging markets have gone out of their way to accumulate rainy-day funds of dollars and other foreign currencies. With the conspicuous exception of China, bank regulators in emerging markets have also imposed tougher lending regulations and kept shadow banking operations on tight leashes.\n\nWhile emerging markets may face trouble from beyond their borders, for many of them, spending at home has seldom been so strong. Many businesses are even struggling to find enough workers. In the Philippines, a popular chain of chicken restaurants now promises a free meal to new employees and their families within five minutes of their signing up for work. Some McDonald's franchises have put up signs offering free meals merely for filling out a job application. \"I'd never seen a sign like that,\" President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines said in an interview at the presidential palace in Manila last week.\n\nIndia and Indonesia suffered large declines in their currencies and stock markets last summer, lasting through early autumn, after Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time, indicated in May that the Fed would start easing back on measures that helped keep longer-term rates at historically low levels. Mr Bernanke's warnings had the effect of attracting money from overseas investors to the United States.\n\nBoth India and Indonesia have since sharply narrowed the deficits in their current accounts, a broad measure of trade and financing. They allowed significant depreciation in their currencies last summer, which made imports more expensive and their exports more competitive. As a result, both countries have less need of further foreign investment in their financial markets, although they could still be hurt if overseas investors withdrew money that they had already put in.\n\n\"There definitely will be an effect of both the Fed tapering and a cooling China,\" said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank in Mumbai. But \"India is definitely better prepared today to deal with these foreign shocks than it was nine months ago\".\n\nPolitical troubles have played a role in market declines in countries such as Turkey and Argentina. They have also played a role in Asia, most notably in Thailand, where Bangkok has been clogged with demonstrators for weeks. Yet. even the Thai tourism industry seems to be weathering the difficulties surprisingly well so far.\n\n\"Even though everyone says the economies in China and India are having problems, we still see increases in their numbers\" of tourists, said Pornthip Hiranyakij, the managing director of Destination Asia, a travel company.\n\nThe Chinese variable\n\nThe big question now is how much further growth in China will slow. A serious cutback in China's demand would not just harm emerging markets' shipments directly to China, it would also cause further erosion in the already falling world prices for emerging markets' coal, copper, palm oil and other commodities.\n\nJianguang Shen, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, last week labelled troubles in China's so-called shadow banking sector the biggest potential threat to that country's economic growth this year. China has been able to contain meltdowns in the shadow banking sector to a few cities so far. But they have been spectacular where they have occurred, as in Shenmu in the north-west, where all but one of the car dealerships failed last summer, and scores of other businesses closed.\n\nHSBC calculates that growth in China's economy now adds twice as many dollars to annual global demand as growth in the US economy and far more than the anaemic economies of the European Union. \"China needs to keep humming, or US and EU growth would need to step up meaningfully to make up the difference,\" said Frederic Neumann, the bank's co-head of Asian economic research.\n\nOne way for developing countries in South and South-east Asia to avoid being clobbered by weaker commodity exports is for them to displace China's own increasingly high-cost producers of coal, aluminium and other minerals. Some of that is already happening with China announcing on Wednesday a jump in imports during January.\n\nAnother tactic is for emerging markets to start replacing China as the preferred locale for making export goods such as clothing, shoes and electronics. Blue-collar wages have increased at least fivefold in China over the past decade, prompting a few industries, including garment and shoe production, to start shifting to South-east Asia. China is still gaining global market share in consumer electronics, however. That may change, though not rapidly enough to help emerging markets this year.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM", "images": []}

The bank said it hit its target of doubling cross-border business lending last December - six months ahead of the scheduled three years.\n\nLoans to Chinese companies expanding across Asia through Singapore make up at least half the FDI flows facilitated by the bank.\n\nIts executive director and head of group FDI advisory unit, Sam Cheong, attributes this to China's go-global strategy in 1999, which encouraged Chinese firms to expand overseas. Chinese companies have thus moved strongly to invest in South-east Asia, especially in the past two years - what he described as a \"natural trend\" as China develops.\n\nTrade between China and South-east Asia has grown by an average of 23 per cent year-on-year in the past decade; FDI flows into the region stood at US$116 billion last year, driven by rapid urbanisation and upgrading of infrastructure, the growing middle class and the natural resources available, he said.\n\nSingapore attracted close to half the total flows into South-east Asia, receiving US$56 billion in FDI, and continues to be an attractive hub for many FDIs looking to expand through the Republic into the region, said Mr Cheong.\n\nWith companies' incorporation here and the country's lower cost of borrowing relative to the region, most of UOB's cross-border loans originate here.\n\nBut as firms use Singapore as a springboard into the region, many of the completed deals are not simply Singapore-centric; they involve multiple countries, he noted.\n\nUOB's clients - mainly from construction, manufacturing and commodity- and resource-trading - are also looking to other countries. Myanmar and Indonesia, for example, have bigger consumer markets. These two countries, along with Iskandar in Malaysia, also offer lower manufacturing costs.\n\nCost efficiencies are one reason Singapore companies are expanding overseas. Mr Cheong said there has been a 30 per cent rise in the number of local companies using the FDI advisory unit to look into overseas expansion. The average turnover size for a Singapore company expanding overseas is S$50 million, half the average size of UOB's global FDI clients.\n\nAs each country has its own strengths, Mr Cheong said, UOB's nine units play a crucial role in connecting the whole region. \"It is truly value-adding to our relationship-coverage team in a very effective engagement of FDI,\" he said.\n\nWith better economic harmonisation to stem from the Asean Economic Community at the end of next year, the bank has a \"very optimistic outlook\" in terms of trade flows in the region. It aims to achieve half its profit from overseas by end-2015.\n\nA lot is happening in South-east Asia, where the group is strong, said Mr Cheong. \"We're at the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investor demand is driving prices as high as 90 cents on the dollar, from 70 to 80 cents a year ago, according to Hartland Shipping Services, a London-based shipbroking and consulting company that split off from HSBC Holdings in 2012.\n\nThe influx illustrates a broader shift as investors load up on debt being abandoned by banks amid regulations intended to prevent future taxpayer bailouts.\n\nFunds are betting that ship prices that collapsed as much as 71 per cent in five years will rebound from historic lows. If a prolonged downturn drives borrowers to default, the funds are preparing to do something banks historically resisted: take over vessels themselves.\n\n\"The markets are flush with liquidity in terms of investors looking for homes,\" said Randee Day, president and chief executive officer of Day & Partners, an advisory and consulting firm specialising in shipping, who ran JPMorgan Chase's shipping division in the 1980s. \"If I was still managing a portfolio at a bank, I'd be unloading like mad.\"\n\nWhile banks have been trying to reduce their loans to the shipping industry for years, a market for secondary debt didn't emerge until 2012, Paul Leand, AMA's chief executive officer, said. Banks tended to hold on to their loans until regulatory pressure added urgency to divest them in late 2013, Mr Day said. Outstanding bank loans to shipowners total US$460 billion as at November, according to Petrofin Research in Athens.\n\nDavidson Kempner Capital Management late last year paid US$500 million for part of Lloyds Banking Group's shipping portfolio, according to Marine Money, an industry newsletter. Ian Kitts, a spokesman for Lloyds, and Catherine Jones, an external spokeswoman for Davidson Kempner at ASC Advisors in Greenwich, Connecticut, declined to comment.\n\nIn December, Commerzbank AG, Germany's second-biggest bank, sold 14 chemical tankers to a fund managed by Oaktree Capital Management, eliminating 280 million euros (S$484.7 million) in non-performing shipping loans.\n\nDNB ASA, Norway's largest bank, sold loans it had made to Genco Shipping & Trading to undisclosed buyers, spokesman Thomas Midteide said. He didn't disclose the price. Genco has a 7.8 per cent chance of defaulting in a year, the lowest rating short of distress, according to the Bloomberg Default Risk Scale.\n\nHSH Nordbank AG, the largest shipping lender, is preparing to sell a portfolio of shipping loans after a previous package valued at about 300 million euros failed to attract investors, Wolfgang Topp, who heads its restructuring unit, said. The bank is talking only to buyers in the industry, not financial firms, because \"they pursue a different investment strategy\", he said.\n\nCommerzbank and HSH Nordbank are among about 130 banks deemed to pose a systemic risk and selected to undergo an assessment by the European Central Bank to measure the quality of their assets and the strength of their balance sheets in stress scenarios. The review and new guidelines by the European Banking Authority will lead to increasing bad debt provisions, Moody's Investors Service said in a December report.\n\nHedge funds and private-equity firms are approaching ship management companies about hiring them to run acquired fleets, according to Jason Klopfer, Westport, Connecticut-based commercial director of Navig8 Group, which operates 248 tankers and bulkers, up from 175 a year ago.\n\nRather than take ships onto their balance sheets, banks prefer to sell the debt, Michael Parker, global industry head of shipping and logistics at Citigroup, said on Feb 4 at a conference in New York.\n\nPrivate-equity firms, meanwhile, are willing to take ownership of the asset and put it to work while they wait for prices to appreciate, Mr Klopfer said.\n\nWhile funds haven't repossessed ships yet, they first started inquiring about hiring managers about 18 months ago, said Steve Rodley, co-founder of Global Maritime Investments (GMI), a London-based manager that operates 50 to 80 vessels. GMI is in talks with debt investors about managing ships they may take over, Mr Rodley said.\n\nInvestors are also forming joint ventures to order new vessels, such as Oaktree's partnership with Navig8 announced in October. Seeing an opportunity in low prices for modern, fuel-efficient ships, the company ordered six chemical tankers at a South Korean shipyard for delivery in 2015, it said in a November statement. GMI ordered six ships financed by a large US institutional fund, Mr Rodley said.\n\nSimilarly, funds owned by Apollo Global Management teamed up with Hamburg-based ship manager Rickmers Group to invest as much as US$500 million in container vessels, the companies said in a Sept 23 statement. York Capital Management formed a joint venture with Greek ship owner Costamare Inc to buy five containerships for more than US$190 million, Gregory Zikos, Costamare's chief financial officer, said in a September interview.\n\nAvenue Capital Group, the distressed-debt firm with about US$12.6 billion of assets under management, invested \"a couple (of) hundred million dollars\" in containerships through a partnership with an undisclosed shipowner, co-founder and chief executive officer Marc Lasry said.\n\nBanks benefit as investors bid up prices, Jae Kwon, managing director of investment banking at DNB Markets, said at the Feb 4 conference. Debt is trading higher than it would be without demand from hedge funds, he said.\n\n\"Shipping has become a bit of a 'story', and it's regarded as being at a cyclical low,\" Nigel Prentis, Hartland's head of consultancy, said on Jan 23. \"There's quite a lot of money chasing fairly few opportunities,\" pushing up prices for second-hand debt, he said.\n\nInvestors frequently underestimate how long companies can survive unprofitable rates, said Mr Day, who worked on the bankruptcy restructuring of General Maritime Corp, a US tanker owner. Ship values and freight rates have started to rebound from lows that followed owners ordering too many ships before the global recession. The ClarkSea Index, a measure of industrywide earnings, rose 41 per cent in the past year to US$10,767 a day. The 2012 average of US$9,586 was the lowest since at least 1990.\n\nA five-year-old supertanker now sells for US$65.2 million, compared with US$54.2 million a year ago and less than half the US$162 million high in 2008, according to the Baltic Exchange in London. The price of a Capesize, the largest type of dry-bulk carrier, rose 50 per cent in the past year to US$44.5 million, 29 per cent of 2008's peak of US$153.8 million.\n\nThe dynamics of shipping markets are difficult to understand and predict, said Basil Karatzas, a New York shipbroker/adviser.\n\n\"Quite a few of the funds that are buying these loans are not familiar with shipping, they are newcomers and some may doubt how fast they can manage to climb the learning curve,\" Mr Karatzas said on Feb 6.\n\n\"When there are 20 funds bidding on the same portfolio, and the consensus is, 'The markets have turned around and we better get on the wagon or we'll miss this opportunity,' that's when people get too optimistic,\" he said.\n\nJust as the industry emerges from the worst glut in decades, fleet growth is poised to accelerate again as orders increase. Contracts for new ships almost tripled last year to 150 million deadweight tons (dwt), the highest since 2010, according to Clarkson plc, the world's largest shipbroker.\n\nShipyards are booked to build 290.2 million dwt as at the start of 2014, the first increase since 2009, data show.

The company was the builder of the iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.\n\nAs a result, the volume of issues with a domestic Single A rating plunged to nine trillion won (S$10.7 billion) last year, down from 20 trillion won the year before, while Korea Development Bank has stepped in to support stressed companies by buying unsold corporate bonds.\n\n\"It's hard to expect the sector to improve and investors are staying away from buying weaker names in that industry,\" the credit analyst said, adding that domestic demand was likely to be limited to the stronger builders, such as Samsung C&T, Posco and Hyundai Engineering & Construction. All these builders are selling won bonds this month.\n\n\"We haven't really hit the bottom yet. It's hard even to calculate how much these companies need to pay in premiums now because there hasn't been much issuance from the worse names recently.\"\n\nYields on GS Engineering & Construction's domestic three-year bonds rose to 4.02 per cent at the end of 2013 from 3.48 per cent a year earlier, while yields on the three-year government bond remained in the 2.8 per cent range throughout that period.\n\nThree-year bonds from Taeyoung, a commercial property builder, were yielding 4.42 per cent at the end of 2013, up from 4.08 per cent a year earlier. Spreads for lower-rated issuers had widened far more.\n\nGS E&C managed to bring in some rare international investment last month with the first overseas convertible bond from a Korean construction company.\n\nOn Jan 23, the company sold US$100 million of 3.25 per cent convertible bonds due 2019 with an investor put option at year two and conversion premium of 25 per cent.\n\nWhile that provided a welcome funding alternative, the deal proved a tough sell and was priced at the wide end of terms. Bankers working on similar deals for other Korean clients say they are having a tough time generating interest. \"Investors are negative on the construction industry and there is almost no appetite for this,\" said one banker.\n\nCredit analysts widely expect more downgrades in the construction sector, pushing up funding costs even further and leaving more companies frozen out of the market.\n\nThe dichotomy in Korea's domestic bond market may take at least until next year to start recovering, according to Louis Shin, head of fixed-income research at Woori Investment & Securities.\n\n\"The trend is for more companies to see their credit ratings fall, especially if they continue to struggle to get financing or fail to sell assets,\" he said. \"I don't expect the situation to get any better unless Korea is able to develop a more efficient high-yield market domestically or attract more foreign funding from investors, as well as distressed-debt investors.\" - IFR\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

But whether it should be responsible for the fate of the rest of the world is. Earlier this month, the US Federal Reserve came under fire from Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, who said that the Fed should think about how its policies are affecting the rest of the world. His comments were echoed by the International Monetary Fund, which called on central banks to ensure that an international funding crunch does not happen.\n\nThe flak the Fed is receiving is due to its decision to taper its purchases of long-dated bonds. This has hit financial markets and emerging market assets in particular. Since last May, when the first hints of tapering started to take shape, money has flowed out of regional assets, which have become less attractive upon higher anticipated yields on US long-dated bonds. The Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit and the Indian rupee all plummeted against the US dollar last August. In late January, fears of slow Chinese economic growth and financial stability concerns were compounded with political instability in Turkey and the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. As the lira fell by more than 10 per cent against the US dollar in a matter of weeks, Turkey's central bank dramatically doubled interest rates overnight. India, too, has surprised consensus by raising rates for the third time in five months. South Africa raised rates too. The S&P 500 was not spared, falling from 1,850 points in mid-January to about 1,740 in early February, before recovering in the past week.\n\nEmerging market central banks are caught in a dilemma. When rates were low, hot capital inflows caused asset bubbles in sectors like infrastructure and real estate. Now that rates might rise, capital outflows are causing their currencies to come under pressure. If local exchange rates are allowed to slide against the dollar, the cost of imports will increase and undesired inflation is the result. Companies might find it difficult to repay debt denominated in dollars. Foreign investors will also be reluctant to come in. Instead of a cheaper currency attracting investors, fear tends to feed on itself, resulting in further declines. Meanwhile, if interest rates are hiked to cool inflation, domestic growth might become a casualty. Capital controls can be put in place to prevent outflows or inflows, but they come with costs of their own.\n\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, slower growth will also affect the US, even though new Fed chief Janet Yellen said recently that emerging market developments do not pose a substantial risk to the US economic outlook. As the recent global stock sell-off demonstrated, US markets remain sensitive. As the world's finance ministers and central bankers meet in Sydney this weekend for a G-20 meeting, the old topic of whether countries should act without regard for others might very well be discussed. Individual countries must, of course, give priority to their own domestic economies. But the issue of what can be done to ensure the stability of global capital markets should not be ignored.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But, as they look at the wider financial world, they are also likely to see the next 12 months as the Year of the Taper - a period of intense debate around the international consequences of tapering the Fed's ultra-loose monetary policy, not least in Asian countries such as China, which align their currencies with the dollar.\n\nDespite the taper, investors are more likely than not to reap positive returns from stocks this year. Stocks rose, in fact, on the day the taper was announced in December.\n\nBut, as recent jitters over Asian markets have shown, investors should also steel themselves for increased volatility.\n\nCountries with current account deficits and which rely on external funding have proved particularly sensitive to capital flowing back towards the US, as the taper sends market interest rates higher. Last year, for instance, the S&P 500 gained almost 30 per cent with less than 10 per cent volatility. But with equity valuations back at long-term averages, we see this year's market gains in line with earnings growth of 7 to 8 per cent.\n\nAs the Fed's policy shifts to uncharted taper territory, volatility is likely to rise back to longer-term averages.\n\nFor Asian markets, which have already felt more of that volatility at hand over the past 12 months, this may introduce an extra level of uncertainty.\n\nLower returns and higher-potential volatility increase the chance of temporary losses. Investors in Asian markets over the past few years will have become more accustomed to seeing their holdings decline.\n\nIf they have shifted their holdings into global stocks, they will have suffered only one calendar year of negative returns out of the past five.\n\nHowever, if future returns decrease and volatility rises, the chances increase that an investor will encounter negative returns in a quarterly portfolio statement.\n\nHow equity investors react to any upcoming volatility will be critical in determining their investment returns over the medium term. If they receive a short-term statement dotted with red, some will panic and sell their holdings. By doing so, they will deprive themselves of greater returns in what should be a positive overall environment for stocks.\n\nOthers might start trading more actively. Although correlations between stocks have been falling, leading to greater divergences in share price moves, there is little evidence that people's stock-picking ability will magically improve in such an environment.\n\nWhile some will be successful, many investors will only increase their trading costs and lower their returns.\n\nPerhaps the most worrying behavioural response to lower returns will be those investors who, anchored to the return expectations of recent years, take on unsuitable levels of leverage to \"make up\" the performance gap. Leverage and volatility do not mix well.\n\nWith behavioural risks higher in the Year of the Taper and equity returns likely to be lower, investors need to address the volatility side of the equation.\n\nGiven that diversification is perhaps the only \"free lunch\" in finance, investors should broaden their portfolios into assets that are uncorrelated with equities and smooth their returns.\n\nOne diversifier could be best-of-breed hedge funds, the expertise of which gives them the best chance of capitalising on the increasing divergence in stock-price movements. Many equity hedge funds also seek to profit from special situations such as mergers and acquisitions activity, which was up 5 per cent year-on-year last year, according to Dealogic.\n\nIn short, investors are still likely to bank gains from stocks in 2014, even if volatility rises.\n\nAnd although we continue to believe the US will outperform, certain Asian markets are now a key source of value. As long as China avoids an uncontrolled default on a trust product, for instance, or there are signs the Chinese economy is slowing further, we believe Chinese stocks have the capacity to outperform over the next six months.\n\nThe Chinese government's commitment to reform and capacity to manage financial troubles should help the country remain more resilient than neighbours such as Indonesia, which depend more on external funding.\n\nAs the Year of the Taper progresses, however, investors must be disciplined in their approach. While most in the market do their best to separate their investments from their feelings, lower returns and a higher chance of volatility will make such distinctions more difficult.\n\nAs the fear of opening red portfolio statements resurfaces, investors will need to keep their heads, diversify and remember that investing is more than a feeling.\n\nThe writer is the global head of investment at UBS Wealth Management\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM", "images": []}

Brokers and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) regularly conduct educational seminars, the exchange's website is a useful source of instructional information and commissions are now razor-thin, yet volume today is poor, phones are not ringing and many brokers are seriously contemplating throwing in the towel.\n\nAs one remisier noted, why stay in stockbroking and service retail clients for 40 per cent of 0.2 per cent of business done, when real estate brokers can earn 1-2 per cent? Why indeed. As we have noted many times before, the only way to change this is to address the concerns of the retail segment, both the punters who trade regularly and the frontline staff who actually bring in the business and service the retail investing public. Listening to what they have to say may prove useful.\n\nAccording to these parties, a great deal of the reluctance to trade today originates from last October's penny stock crash. The handling of that sorry episode was undoubtedly poor and hardly inspired confidence, with patchy and incomplete information from regulators compounding the fear and panic that surrounded that collapse. This, according to unanimous feedback, has significantly dented confidence in the system and is keeping retail punters away.\n\n\"Clients are worried that the authorities will clamp down very hard on speculative punting and shift the goal posts after the game has started,\" said one trading representative (TR), summing up existing fears.\n\nOne of the measures proposed post-October is to curb contra trading by shortening the settlement period and to require 5 per cent collateral for all trades. Setting aside the question of whether contra trading really played a significant role in the rise and fall of the penny sector, this proposal would undoubtedly be unpopular among older TRs, retail players and those with clients who rely heavily on contra. However, there is no denying that if implemented, this move would reduce the credit risk which TRs and ultimately their brokerages have to bear, so on balance, it should be seen as a step in the right direction and thus should be accepted in that spirit.\n\nHowever, to allow some latitude for contra trading without collateral and thus cater to die-hard punters, a suggestion has been made that the 5 per cent requirement should apply only for trades above a certain size, perhaps $50,000. This is worth considering, but it's possible to take it a step further and instead have a progressive scale where the larger the sum traded, the higher the collateral.\n\nSo perhaps for trades under $50,000 no margin need be deposited; for trades say from $50,000-$250,000 the client would have to put up 5 per cent, and for trades above $250,000, 10 per cent collateral would be required. Having such a graduated scale should afford even greater protection for TRs while allowing some scope for speculative punting.\n\nIt would offer another advantage - freed from the burden of having to worry about credit risk, TRs would have more scope to service their clients, something which according to anecdotal evidence is badly lacking in today's market. The better the service retail investors receive, the more likely they would be to trade, but it shouldn't stop there - as a complementary move, it's worth considering reinstating the lunch break that was taken away in August 2011.\n\nAlthough we do not have official numbers, the vast majority of brokers contend that liquidity has not improved after SGX's switch to continuous all-day trading, which spans the eight hours from 9am to 5pm.\n\nEven if there has been an improvement, is it really all about money? Is there no room at all for the exchange to demonstrate some sympathy for the needs of a community whose job, it has to be said, has grown increasingly restrictive and unattractive?\n\nGranted, some TRs now work in teams and take turns to go for lunch, while others rely on mobile platforms using smart devices like iPads, so some have adapted. But this does not apply to all TRs, many of whom previously used the break to meet clients and talk to them about their needs but have since abandoned the practice. Is it any wonder therefore that service standards today are where they are - virtually non-existent?\n\nSGX should seriously explore possible compromises, perhaps closing for lunch when Hong Kong breaks between 12pm and 1pm and extending the trading hours, maybe to 5.30pm. If it did this, it would lose only 30 minutes' worth of business but gain an incalculable amount of goodwill.\n\nThe same goes for our oft-repeated suggestion to address the split in commissions between TRs and their houses. The industry norm is 60-40 in favour of the house; the exchange should encourage a shift towards a more equitable split, such as 60-40 in favour of TRs. After all, TRs are really SGX's frontline sales proxies, selling the exchange and its offerings to the retail public. Engaging them has to be the way forward.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The declines were the result of heavy investments in new long-distance aircraft and other expenses linked to its rapid and controversial expansion into South-east Asia and the United States.\n\nNorwegian Air, Europe's third-largest low-cost airline by passengers carried, swung to a net loss of 196.8 million Norwegian kroner (S$40.7 million), from a net profit of 23.6 million kroner in the three months ended Dec 31. For the full year, net profit fell to nearly 319 million kroner, from 457 million in 2012.\n\nChief executive, Bjorn Kjos, attributed the weaker result to unfavourable exchange rates as well as to 216 million kroner in unanticipated costs linked to the start of direct flights to New York, Bangkok and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n\nDelivery delays and technical problems with its new fleet of three Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which had to be substituted with less efficient leased aircraft, also added to those expenses, he said.\n\nNorwegian Air, which until recently specialised in flights within Europe, burst onto the global scene last spring with cut-rate fares to holiday destinations in Thailand and the United States. But its business model, which involves basing some of its pilots and crew in Thailand and hiring American flight attendants, has been met with strong objections from labour groups and airlines in the European Union and the United States.\n\nLong flights represent a small fraction of Norwegian Air's operations, but the carrier, which is headquartered in Fornebu, Norway, near Oslo, and has bases in Copenhagen, Stockholm and London, has big ambitions to expand.\n\nFrode Foss, Norwegian Air's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that revenue from the carrier's intercontinental operations represented 2 per cent of overall sales last year. The expected delivery of four more Dreamliners this year would probably double that share of revenue in 2014.\n\nNorwegian Air is also due to receive 14 new Boeing 737 single-aisle jets this year. They will be deployed on European routes, expanding the airline's overall seat capacity by 40 per cent. Mr Foss said that roughly one-third of Norwegian Air's capacity growth would be on new American routes planned for this summer.\n\nThe airline's European fleet of single-aisle jets is registered in Norway, but the Dreamliners that ply its intercontinental routes are registered in Ireland. On Wednesday, the carrier received an Irish operating license for its long-distance subsidiary, a move that it hopes will allow the unit to benefit from a 2007 agreement that liberalised air travel between the United States and the European Union, even though Norway is not a member of the 28-member bloc.\n\nAmerican pilots' unions, airlines and some lawmakers are crying foul, saying that Norwegian Air's business model violates the spirit of the so-called Open Skies agreement between Washington and Brussels. They argue that the carrier is simply seeking a European Union \"flag of convenience\". - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Goods and services tax revenues may beat original projections to hit $9.4 billion, they say, thanks to stronger GDP growth of 3.7 per cent last year. That exceeded the original forecast of 1-3 per cent growth, which FY2013 budget estimates were based on.\n\nCorporate and personal income taxes, collected on incomes for FY2012, are also expected to outperform initial estimates, despite weaker GDP growth in 2012.\n\nDespite the slowdown in property sales in the second half of 2013, stamp duties may grow 11.4 per cent year-on-year, said UOB economist Francis Tan, who predicts an overall surplus of $5.86 billion. The decline from moderating sales was partly offset by the introduction of the additional buyers' stamp duty.\n\nThe government had projected a decline in both stamp duties and income taxes. But for the first eight months of FY2013, the strongest year-on-year increases came from GST and property tax revenues, noted Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin, who expects a $6.3 billion overall surplus.\n\nThere is still the question of what happened on the spending front, said OCBC economist Selena Ling. If the government spent as it had budgeted for in the final two fiscal quarters of FY2013, the budget surplus may be around $3.9 billion. But if the government was more conservative and spent closer to FY2012's figures, the surplus could surge to $6-7 billion.\n\nThis coming fiscal year (FY2014), the surplus may shrink. UOB forecasts an overall budget surplus of $5.24 billion, while Citi expects the finance minister to outline a much-smaller $2.7 billion surplus when he speaks on Friday.\n\nWeaker stamp duty collections and asset taxes, on the back of a cooling property market, will offset gains in income taxes, thanks to strong FY2013 GDP growth.\n\nExpenditure on infrastructure and social spending is likely to pick up, as are special transfers - subsidies for healthcare and transport, the Pioneer Generation Package and Productivity and Innovation Credit payouts, Citi said.\n\nThese may in part be financed by a larger net investment returns contribution (NIRC) - the portion of the returns on past reserves that the government can take into its Budget - but the surplus will probably narrow.\n\nAlso, the government has now entered into the second half of its electoral cycle. As it is mandatory for the government of the day to balance the Budget over its electoral term, the government has an incentive to \"save fiscal bullets\" for the latter half of the term, nearer the elections, the Citi economists noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And obviously, compliance is about making sure you follow the rules - and more so for GIC because it is the fund manager of the government and all our investments are in the name of the Singapore government, which means that there are other factors that we have to take into consideration, like reputational risks.\n\n\"I would say it is a continuous drive for me and my company to keep up with compliance,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Lim added that there should be more people at the operational level being more vocal in their views on compliance and providing feedback to management on the practicality of the rules - rather than just following the rules in silence. In other words, companies should \"live within the rules but live in a smart way\" and equip their people to make good decisions, he said.\n\nGIC has in-house legal department, risk, compliance and audit teams that ensure that it adheres to best practices and complies with high standards of governance and strong risk management.\n\nWhile Mr Lim noted that trust is the most important quality for companies, greater transparency alone does not always lead to greater trust. Companies have to manage themselves with integrity that generates trust from employees and clients, he said.\n\nMr Lim was addressing a question on compliance from the audience at the Stars Singapore Symposium yesterday that saw close to a hundred participants. The Stars Symposium targets talents who are earmarked to be leaders in their organisations.\n\nFounded by Toni Schonenberger, CEO of UBS Wolfsberg, the symposium is being held in Singapore for the first time, having been hosted in Switzerland for six years and in China for two years.\n\nAbout 75 per cent of the participants came from the business sector, while the rest came from government, educational institutions, non-government organisations and the media.\n\nMr Lim, who has just launched his book, The Teacher And You: Leadership Through The Third Generation, also shared his thoughts about global leadership at the symposium.\n\nHe emphasised the need for good self-management before leading others, and leading changes within the organisation. \"Performing well today is not enough,\" he said, stressing the need for companies to embrace change \"in good time\" and \"in good times\", and to think ahead.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If government transfers and taxes are taken into account, the coefficient fell to 0.412 - the lowest since 2000 when the Statistics Department started compiling it.\n\nResident households overall got an average $3,440 per household member last year - higher than the $2,760 in 2012 - from government schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement and Growth Dividends.\n\nHouseholds in HDB one- and two-room flats received $8,631 per household member - more than their annual income of $8,264 per member - in government help in 2013, up from $7,210 in 2012.\n\nOver a longer time- frame of five years, incomes rose in all income brackets - including that of the top earners whose incomes tend to fluctuate more. Their income increased 1.0 per cent yearly in real terms during 2008-2013.\n\nTotal household income from employment went up 2 per cent per annum during this period. Measured by per household member, it rose 1.9 per cent yearly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sentiment on equities is optimistic, given that few companies see any significant short interest, it added.\n\nFollowing the recent wave of bearish sentiment in Asia, Markit studied whether Singapore's fixed income and equity markets have been lumped with those of its regional peers, many of whom have seen surging short interest and foreign capital flight, said Markit analyst Simon Colvin.\n\n\"Despite having one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the region, Singapore's government debt has proved to be one of the most resilient among its regional peers,\" he said.\n\nSingapore government debt trades at 2.21 per cent according to Markit iBoxx Asian Bond Fund, which puts the country on par with the likes of Taiwan and Hong Kong. The latter have much smaller debt-to-GDP ratios.\n\nSouth Korea, whose debt-to-GDP ratio stands at a third of Singapore according to the IMF, sees its debt trade at more than 120 basis points wider than Singapore.\n\nSingapore's debt-to-GDP ratio was 97 per cent in 2012, compared with 42 per cent and 33 per cent for Taiwan and Hong Kong, respectively. South Korea's ratio was 34 per cent.\n\nWhile the city-state has seen the yield on its debt widen over the past 12 months along with every one of its regional peers, the current debt is trading at 2011 levels and well below the levels it reached in the middle of the last decade, noted Mr Colvin.\n\nChinese government debt, on the other hand, yields over twice Singapore's debt and is reaching its 2004 highs.\n\nSingapore corporate bonds, another key investor sentiment metric, are performing well, Mr Colvin said. Local corporate bonds have outperformed their government peers in the 18 months since the inception of the Markit iBoxx Singapore Dollar index.\n\nWhile corporates have also come under pressure in the past six months since US tapering talk started to grow louder, the yield required by investors to hold Singapore corporate over government debt has tightened by nearly a quarter of one per cent.\n\nAs for the equity market, short interest has remained relatively steady, he said.\n\nWhile South Korea and Hong Kong have both seen their short interest surge in the last six weeks, demand to borrow shares in the main STI index has remained relatively flat since the start of the year.\n\nThe 9 per cent jump in short interest of the STI constituents is less than half of the surge seen in Hong Kong and South Korea's main indices, he said.\n\nAlthough the 2 per cent of average short interest in Singapore is on par with the two countries, short interest here is concentrated towards two constituents - SPH and Olam.\n\nData on short interest - defined as shares outstanding on loan - is collected by tracking the securities lending loans which are made to deliver on shorts.\n\nShort interest in SPH has doubled to almost 12 per cent from about 6 per cent late last year. At yesterday's closing price of $4.00, the stock has fallen 3 per cent year-to-date and 9.3 per cent from the 52-week high of $4.41 on Nov 4.\n\n\"I'm not sure why the short interest is so high because the share price has done nothing,\" said Mr Colvin.\n\nAs for Olam, the short interest of 6.9 per cent stands at a 52-week low of shares outstanding, despite renewed pressure from investor activist site Muddy Waters. Last September, Muddy Waters attacked Olam, saying that its shares had no value. Olam shares are up 3.9 per cent year-to-date.\n\nMr Colvin also looked at listed developers' short interest and found only one major firm - City Developments - to have sustained short interest.\n\n\"Despite curbs by the government aimed at curbing international property speculation, the country's real estate firms have seen little in the way of sustained short interest,\" he said.\n\nThe only major firm to see any sustained demand to borrow in that space is City Development, which has 3.8 per cent of its free float out on loan.\n\n\"Despite this, and the fact that its equity value has plummeted in recent months, bondholders are holding relatively steady in the firm with the developer yielding 1.6 per cent, a lower yield than the short-dated SGD corporate bond universe.\"\n\nBond yields fall when prices rise.\n\nCity Development shares are down 2.29 per cent year-to-date and 19.2 per cent lower than their 52-week high reached on May 13 last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Total demand fell to 3,756 tonnes, from 4,416 tonnes in 2012.\n\nThe full-year numbers that the industry body released yesterday confirmed what data in recent quarters had suggested: that China overtook India to become the largest gold consumer.\n\nChina consumed 1,120 tonnes in jewellery, bars and coins last year, compared with 848 tonnes in 2012. India's consumption rose 13 per cent to 975 tonnes in spite of measures introduced to limit gold demand, as more gold got smuggled into the country.\n\n2013 marked the year of the consumer, said the council. A plunge in gold price last April sparked a surge in buying by retail investors in China and India, and also an unprecedented flow of gold from vaults in Switzerland and London to these countries.\n\n\"(Asian investors) have been sitting on the sidelines for a couple of years (as gold prices rose),\" Albert Cheng, the council's managing director of the Far East, told The Business Times. \"Even when prices were volatile last year, we have seen the people coming in, and they are comfortable to accumulate gold, particularly the value seeker.\"\n\nIn the fourth quarter last year, jewellery demand in Europe and the US, where consumer sentiment has been improving, picked up.\n\nThe council attributed the lag to the time it took for lower international prices to feed through to lower levels in the West, unlike in India and China where prices are adjusted on a daily basis. While the growth in consumer demand of 679 tonnes last year was the largest year-on-year increase since the council started records, it was still unable to absorb the total outflows in ETFs of 881 tonnes - a third of global gold production from mines.\n\nHedge funds and institutional investors began withdrawing from gold ETFs last year as speculation of a reduction in the US monetary stimulus started. The price of gold fell 28 per cent last year, its first bearish turn in 13 years.\n\nBut bullion has staged a surprise comeback since the start of this year, with its price rising 9 per cent to about US$1,313 an ounce, supported by weaker-than- expected macroeconomic data. This has injected more optimism into the gold market.\n\nOutflows in gold ETFs stabilised in January, then reversed in February, said ANZ commodity strategist Victor Thianpiriya. \"That suggests to us that maybe some of the long-term investors are getting back into gold as well. It's a bit of a mixed picture, but it certainly looks to us it's not as bearish as people were towards the end of 2013.\"\n\nWhile he expects a price pullback soon on profit-taking, he remains positive on gold in the medium term. ANZ has a gold price forecast of US$1,450 for the end of this year. \"China is still buying a record amount of gold,\" he said, adding that supply would be tighter this year without the same level of ETF liquidation that was seen last year.\n\nFor Philip Klapwijk of Hong Kong-based Precious Metals Insights, the outlook this year is still bearish. Most of the demand in China was accelerated last year when prices fell and would be hard to sustain, he said. The reversal in ETF flows also might not last. \"I don't see what has changed fundamentally to put gold into the bull market. I will be surprised if this is the beginning of a recovery in gold.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, last month's primary-market sales volume was the lowest recorded for the month of January since the 108 units in January 2009 during the market nadir after Lehman's collapse.\n\nMarket watchers note that last month, developers chose to hold back launches amid the lull leading up to Chinese New Year festivities this year, on the back of generally weak sentiment ever since the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) was introduced in late-June 2013.\n\nUrban Redevelopment Authority figures show that last month, developers launched 549 private homes, more than four times December's 118 units but a sliver of the 1,814 units released in January 2013.\n\nThe top-selling project last month was The Hillford in Jalan Jurong Kechil in the Upper Bukit Timah area. Marketed as a retirement resort, the 281-unit development sold out because of its attractive pricing, made possible by a shorter-than-usual site tenure of 60 years. The median price achieved for the project was $1,105 psf, according to URA's statistics yesterday.\n\nThe Hillford helped to push up the percentage of developer sales in the up to $1,500 psf band to 85.1 per cent - compared with 66.8 per cent in December, shows Colliers' analysis.\n\nWheelock Properties (Singapore) achieved a $1,343 psf median price for the 58 units it sold in January at The Panorama in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2. The 120 units the developer released in the 698-unit, 99-year leasehold condo are said to be on lower floors.\n\nAs for this month, property consultants' forecasts of developer sales range from 600 to over 1,000 units.\n\nAlready, UOL Group is said to have moved around 210 units at Riverbank@Fernvale, where sales began on Friday. The average price is said to be slightly above $1,000 psf.\n\nNext door, Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Orchard and Sekisui House are expected to begin sales this Friday at Rivertrees Residences. The average price is tipped to be around $1,050-1,060 psf for the project, which boasts a longer frontage of Sungei Punggol reservoir and is much closer to an LRT station. Both projects are on 99-year leasehold sites.\n\nLast month, developers sold 45 executive condominium (EC) units, down from 74 units in December and 256 units in January 2013. Including ECs, which are a public-private housing hybrid, developers moved 610 homes last month, up from 333 homes in December but much lower than the 2,284 units they sold in January 2013.\n\nFor the whole of 2014, most property consultants predict developers could sell around 10,000-12,000 private homes excluding ECs. Last year's figure was 14,948 units, down from 2012's record of 22,197 units.\n\nPrior to TDSR, developers were enjoying \"sure sales\" when they launched projects, notes Jones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui. \"The biggest challenge right now is how to move sales.\"\n\nKnight Frank chairman Tan Tiong Cheng said right pricing is the most critical factor for new launches these days.\n\nBuyers have become more price-sensitive post-TDSR and, at the same time, are spoilt for choice. \"In recent times, developers have paid high prices for land but end-unit prices have started to come off,\" he notes. A developer that hangs on too long to its price risks losing buyers to competitors willing to price their project more competitively.\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Homes CEO Cheang Kok Kheong, who is busy getting ready for this week's launch of Rivertrees Residences, says developers' biggest challenge currently is \"to keep coming up with new products, layouts and designs to wow buyers\".\n\n\"It is naive to think that we can keep minting the same unit-types and layouts. There are so many ECs coming up, so developers of entry-level private condos need to be more imaginative to capture the upgrader market.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}]}

They've since fallen 20 basis points to 255 on Monday, still the most expensive on the iTraxx benchmark of Australian corporate debtors and 61 basis points above British Airways plc.\n\nQantas may be a special case for a government opposed to \"corporate welfare\", Mr Hockey said, because it's crucial to the economy and the largest shareholders in rival Virgin Australia Holdings are state-controlled competitors. The 93-year-old airline needs debt to pay for planes and other capital over the year to June, Qantas said on Dec 5 as it announced plans to cut 1,000 jobs and A$2 billion (S$2.3 billion) in costs.\n\n\"It's a bit of a political football,\" Scott Rundell, a credit strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said on Monday. CDS traders are wary of lowering Qantas costs because \"it's very hard to put a finger on what's going to happen\".\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia said that a period of steady interest rates is likely as record-low borrowing costs and a weaker currency aid growth and it monitors prices after a surprising acceleration in inflation last quarter, according to minutes of its most recent policy meeting released yesterday.\n\nA guarantee on new debt is the \"most likely form of government support\" for Qantas, strategists at Deutsche Bank AG wrote in a Feb 13 note responding to Mr Hockey's comments that day. Such a move \"would be a significant demonstration of support to Qantas\".\n\nAt the same time, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has highlighted the possibility of new legislation to change the Qantas Sale Act, the 1992 law which paved the way for the then government-owned airline's privatisation and which caps foreign ownership of the carrier at 49 per cent.\n\nThe possibility that the government could change the Qantas Sale Act rather than guarantee the airline's debt explains the divergence between its shares and CDS, Michael Bush, head of credit research at National Australia Bank Ltd in Melbourne, said.\n\nA debt guarantee is \"clearly extremely positive for their credit profile\", Mr Bush said. \"If it's going to be little more than pulling back the foreign ownership restriction, that doesn't do much for the credit.\"\n\nThe Australian Financial Review reported yesterday that the federal government is considering a two-part response to Qantas's troubles, with a debt guarantee to provide short-term relief and potential changes to legislation in the longer term to alter foreign ownership restrictions.\n\nFormerly one of just two carriers globally to be judged investment grade by two separate rating companies, Qantas has been dropped to junk status by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service since its Dec 5 forecast of A$300 million of losses in the six months ended December.\n\nCompetition from Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd is helping to push seat yields, a measure of ticket prices, to a 10-year low. Capital spending this year, forecast at A$1.9 billion in August 2012, was cut to A$1.2 billion 12 months later and will now be reviewed again, Qantas said on Dec 5. The company declined to comment on its CDS, citing first-half results due Feb 27.\n\nVirgin has added business class seats, renovated lounges, taken control of a discount carrier and a rural airline, and set up a frequent-flier programme in an attempt to break Qantas's 65 per cent share of Australia's domestic market, which the larger carrier regards as most likely to maximise its profits. The push gave Virgin the third-highest debt levels among global airlines at its most recent year-end in June, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nSince then, shareholders Air New Zealand Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd, and Etihad Airways PJSC have bought into a stock sale that will reduce its net debt from A$1.31 billion to A$961 million, according to a calculation by Bloomberg based on a company presentation.\n\nThe capital raising and the loss of Qantas's investment-grade rating have left the older carrier in the weaker funding position, said Scott Gustetter, chief executive officer of airline consultants Aspirion.\n\nThe swaps fell as low as 250 basis points on Dec 19, the day after the Australian Financial Review reported that the government was working on a final proposal for Qantas's debt. They subsequently reached 288 basis points on Jan 14. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/red-flags-raised-johor-property-market", "site_title": "Red flags raised in Johor property market", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRed flags raised in Johor property market\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Feb 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[JOHOR BAHRU] The property market in Johor, particularly Iskandar Malaysia, might be a case of too much too soon. According to The Star newspaper, red flags are showing in the state where launches of projects and high prices are commonplace but the pace of launches, which now includes \"carpet building\" by China developers, is flooding the market with more houses than what could be sustainable.\n\n\"We welcome foreign developers including those from China, but flooding the market with massive supply of properties could create property overhang,\" Johor Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) chairman Koh Moo Hing told the daily during the weekend.\n\nLatest data by the National Property Information Centre (Napic) indicate that the amount of new homes being built in the near future is equivalent to 42 per cent of the stock of 702,101 houses in the state. Almost 300,000 homes are being built or in the planning stage at a time when the market in Johor has hit a soft patch. Napic data show that at the third quarter of last year, construction for 116,859 homes had already started while the building of 162,579 homes have yet to start.\n\nMeanwhile, 16,168 homes had been approved for construction in Johor in that quarter alone. Analysts say that the new supply does not include new launches by Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Bhd, which is expected to increase three-fold to more than 4,000 units and is expected to remain elevated up to 2017.\n\nThe supply of new homes does not seem to be putting a lid on the escalation of home prices in the state. As the new launches are priced thereabouts or even higher than what is being sold in the more established Klang Valley, the new supply of homes and their higher prices have had a telling impact on prices in the state. The average residential value for Johor property has risen some 45 per cent over the past five years to RM197,147 (S$75,000) in 2012 from RM136,034 in 2009. Comparatively, the country's average residential value has gone up by only 30 per cent in the same period to RM248,515.\n\nResearch house Hwang-DBS Vickers Research notes that recent launches in Nusajaya, Medini, Danga Bay and Johor Bahru are in the range of RM600-1,000 per square foot, with prime units hitting RM1,500 psf. Given that there is going to be an oversupply of homes in Johor, a slew of launches by China-based developers recently has got some worried. The grand entrance of China-based Country Garden Holdings surprised many with the launch of 9,000 apartment units at one go, causing local players to keep a close watch on how they will impact the market there.\n\nMr Koh believes that the magnitude and scale of such launches could lead to a property bubble if foreign developers are given a free hand in their development projects. Rehda is hoping for the state government to possibly impose regulations that limit the number of units built within a year to match the market's demands, says Mr Koh.\n\nHwang-DBS Vickers Research says that Country Garden's 9,000-unit launch in Danga Bay alone could cause a glut, although delivery could be challenging given tight building materials and labour supply over the next three to four years. Analysts are concerned that these developers would replicate the ghost towns in China and if overbuilding does occur in Iskandar, that can be detrimental to the overall physical market in the mid-term. However, some property analysts say that the extra supply would not pose an issue if foreign developers were attracting foreign buyers, rather than targeting only domestic buyers.\n\nCountry Garden, which has impressively sold about 70 per cent of its Danga Bay maiden project in Malaysia, launched in August, said via e-mail that some 3,000 units were snapped up by Malaysians. Meanwhile, about 50 per cent of its foreign buyers are Singaporean and 45 per cent are Chinese. Most of its units were snapped up within a month.\n\nThen, there is Hong Kong-listed Guangzhou R&F Properties, which recently bought 116 acres in Johor Bahru from the Sultan of Johor for RM4.5 billion. Market talk is that a 19-block development is in the blueprint. But according to its filing with the Hong Kong exchange, Guangzhou R&F plans to develop high-rise residential units, low-density housing, retail properties, offices, hotel and a shopping mall, all of which will be on a saleable floor area of about 3.5 million square metres. That's almost 10 times the floor space of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur. Also, Hao Yuan Investment, which is believed to be a China-linked company registered in Singapore, is forming a joint venture with Iskandar Waterfront Holdings to develop 15 hectares in Danga Bay.\n\nNot all are alarmed by the entry of China developers. \"The sprouting of Chinese investors in Malaysia is in tandem with the government's initiative to make Malaysia an international real estate investment destination. Chinese developers have been investing in bluechip locations of New York, Los Angeles, London, Sydney, Singapore and their presence in Malaysia bodes well for the market,\" says Zerin Properties chief executive officer Previn Singhe.\n\nHe is unperturbed by the potential flooding of homes in the future as the supply coming in will be spread over a couple of years. \"Once all the catalytic projects are in place, there would be requirements for new homes to accommodate migrations,\" he says.\n\nAlthough rumour has it that Country Garden has been offering its Chinese buyers a deal that packages a unit in Iskandar together with a purchase of their property in China, it is insignificant to pushing up prices in the area, says V Sivadas, executive director of PA International Property Consultants Sdn Bhd.\n\nAs local and foreign developers grapple and challenge for customers when launching projects in Iskandar Malaysia, the surge in supply coming in has been startling. The slew of houses slated to be built together with a market that is taking a breather after seeing an up-rush in prices and cooling measures starting to bite has seen take-up rates of new developments almost grind to a halt. Post-Budget 2014, take-up rates have come in poorly with developers such as UEM Sunrise Bhd recording only 20 per cent in bookings for its latest project Almas Suites - a small office/home office development in Puteri Harbour. The project, which comprises 526 units, has reportedly completed a measly four sale and purchase agreements.\n\n\"In any case, competition in a growing market such as Iskandar Malaysia, is a good thing - it keeps all of us on our toes and ensures that property buyers have a wide variety of products to choose from. As we all strive to improve, greater value will be created for our customers, investors and end users,\" says Eco World Development Group Bhd CEO Chang Khim Wah.\n\nHowever, this year could look bleak for developers as they are bogged down with a decline in sentiment brought about by the cooling measures such as the increase in real property gains tax, as well as the abolishment of the developers interest bearing scheme, introduced in the latest budget. Also, policies such as the change of the weekend differing from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore has caused a negative knee-jerk reaction with many developers and buyers adopting a wait-and-see attitude.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

This deal, if successful, will increase the telco's exposure to a market that is in perpetual political turmoil, analysts said.\n\nTemasek - Shin Corp's largest shareholder with a 41.6 per cent stake held through a wholly owned unit - discussed selling its stake in the Thai conglomerate to SingTel last year, a Reuters report said yesterday.\n\nIt is unclear if the discussions were about all or part of the stake. But plans to sell the asset founded by former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra had to be put on ice as anti-Thaksin sentiment re-erupted in Bangkok last December.\n\nThe sale - assuming SingTel buys the entire 41.6 per cent Shin Corp stake - will increase SingTel's stake in Thai associate AIS from 23.3 per cent to about 40 per cent. Shin Corp owns 40.45 per cent of AIS, which is Thailand's largest mobile operator.\n\nThis is an academic assumption, as few in the market can envision SingTel swallowing the entire stake in one gulp.\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, the telco declined to comment on \"market rumours\". Temasek would only say that it is \"a long-term investor in Asia, including in Asean\".\n\nSingTel's share price slipped 2 cents or 0.6 per cent to $3.57 yesterday, while Shin Corp and AIS closed 1.97 per cent and 1.35 per cent lower, respectively.\n\nFor many yesterday, the news recalled the tumultuous days of 2006 when Temasek's purchase of Shin Corp inadvertently fanned the flames of an anti-Thaksin revolt that eventually resulted in the then-prime minister's ouster and exile.\n\n\"Terrible, isn't it?\" an analyst said yesterday when asked to comment on the potential SingTel-Temasek deal for Shin Corp.\n\n\"The political exposure (for SingTel) will be way higher.\" While AIS is seen as an apolitical entity, Shin Corp's politically charged history continues to dog it, the analyst reckoned. \"From SingTel's point of view, that would be a definite concern,\" he added.\n\nThe Shin Corp connection can be a heavy cross to bear. In 2007, the senior management of Thai Air- Asia went to the extent of buying out joint-venture partner Shin Corp in a bid to distance the airline from politics.\n\nThe SingTel-Temasek negotiations are not the first kind to take place over a critical national asset of another country. Last year, DBS had to give up its bid to buy a 67.37 per cent stake in Indonesia's PT Bank Danamon from Temasek after Indonesia's regulators stymied the deal's progress.\n\nNow, even as SingTel and Temasek wait for the current anti-Thaksin furore to die down in Bangkok, analysts are lukewarm to the idea of SingTel owning a chunk of Shin Corp or increasing its stake in AIS.\n\n\"The Thai market is a tough one,\" another analyst pointed out. The country's mobile penetration rate is close to 140 per cent, and consumer sentiment has been weak.\n\nAIS itself, despite projecting a 6-8 per cent growth in service revenue for 2014, faces an uphill climb this year. Some believe that the telco underspent on marketing and capital expenditure relative to its competitors over the last two years and will now have to play catch-up.\n\nEven so, AIS's migration of subscribers to the more lucrative new 3G network has gotten off to a good start, with 40 per cent of its subscriber base on it. This year, that proportion is expected to reach 75 per cent.\n\nIf SingTel is nervous about either Thailand's or AIS's prospects, it did not show it at its latest quarterly earnings briefing last week.\n\n\"Our priority now is all about moving from 2G to 3G . . . We're very confident of the future of Thailand. We think it's a great market,\" Paul O'Sullivan, chief executive officer of SingTel's Group Consumer unit, had said then.\n\nSingTel's country chief officer Singapore, Allen Lew, had noted in the same briefing that while telcos were not adversely affected by the 2006 political upheaval, the current turmoil has been more protracted. \"The political unrest is something that we will watch very closely,\" he said.\n\nEven if the political overhang clears up, an examination of Shin Corp's assets will ensue if the deal is pursued in earnest.\n\nLast year, contributions from AIS accounted for 59.6 per cent of its total consolidated revenue and virtually all its consolidated net profit.\n\nRattling about elsewhere in the Shin Corp empire are stakes in satellite operator Thaicom and Internet service provider CSLox. \"From a satellite perspective, there are potential synergies with AIS,\" a consultant with the industry noted.\n\nWhile questions of valuation should override current political turmoil, few dare to underestimate Thailand's unique ability to blend business, power and an unusually long memory.\n\nBy way of illustration, three years ago, Shin Corp changed its name to Intouch, to reflect a \"more friendly and optimistic image\". But today, everybody still calls it \"Shin Corp\".\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Orchid Country Club's lease expires in 2021 but will be renewed for another nine years to 2030 after which there will be no further extension.\n\nParts of the fairways at Tanah Merah Country Club (TMCC) and National Service Resort and Country Club (NSRCC) will be acquired by the end of this year for the expansion of Changi Airport, and one of Singapore Island Country Club's (SICC) golf courses will be made public.\n\nSICC has, however, been given the flexibility to decide which golf course it wants to give up, contrary to earlier expectations that one of its courses at the Bukit location would be affected.\n\nAt a briefing yesterday by government agencies, SICC members who questioned why the Bukit location, next to MacRitchie reservoir, was chosen instead of the Island location - next to the Pierce Reservoirs - were told that they could decide for themselves which course to give up. The course next to the one to be offered for public use would have its lease extended to 2030, while the other unaffected courses will have their leases extended to 2040.\n\nThe SICC course set aside for public use will be run by the labour movement, and will replace the 18-hole course at the Marina Bay Golf Course.\n\nWith the exception of Keppel Club, all the private clubs with less than a decade left in their leases will be allowed to renew them till between 2030 and 2040 - a change from the previous practice of 30-year leases.\n\nExplaining the shorter leases, Law Minister K Shanmugam said at a doorstop after the SICC meeting: \"The URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority) can predict reasonably up to 2040. They didn't want to tie themselves up beyond the period.\"\n\nAnd while utilisation rate of the golf courses had no bearing on the renewal of land lease in the latest review, it might be taken into consideration in the future, said the Law Ministry.\n\nThe government has said that its two main considerations for the renewal of golf courses are whether the land is needed for other uses, and ensuring that the general public, National Service men and the labour movement have enough access to golfing facilities.\n\n\"Where we can give a fresh lease, we will do so. If it's needed for development, then the golf course will have to give way,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"As the number of courses shrink, we'll have to be fair to all, not just existing members, but also members of the public and people who are losing their courses. So we try to have some equity.\"\n\nYesterday's announcement, which comes after much speculation on the fate of the golf clubs, evoked strong reactions from Keppel and SICC members.\n\nWhile the fate of Keppel's current golf course has been known for a while - it was reflected as a residential site as early as the Urban Redevelopment Authority's 2001 Concept Plan - members had been hoping for a replacement site.\n\n\"It's a very unpalatable announcement,\" said Keppel Club member Manoj Sharma, a managing director. \"The precedence was that when the government took a golf course away, they would give a replacement. This time they did not give that option.\"\n\nKeppel members also said that the club's closure was a loss to Singapore heritage. It was founded in 1904 and is one of the oldest here.\n\n\"We need to be a country with heritage, with a soul, with playgrounds,\" said Khor Chee Kok, a financial adviser, though he conceded that the decision was made in the best interest of the country.\n\nThe government will offer Keppel an alternative site to operate as a social club, and encourage the manager of the new public course to consider a tie up with Keppel.\n\nAt SICC, the mood was also downbeat.\n\n\"We are naturally disappointed that the outcome has fallen short of what we had hoped for. With the loss of one of our courses, it will put a strain on our remaining facilities given our large membership base,\" said its president Tay Joo Soon.\n\n\"Nonetheless, as with all golf clubs in Singapore, SICC has to accept that change is on the horizon, and necessary in the broader context of the national interest.\"\n\nSome members expressed concern over how the demarcation of the public and the SICC course will be made and how facilities are to be shared.\n\nSICC has to work with the labour movement on how the courses can be reconfigured, and make the necessary arrangements by end-February 2015 in order for the course next to the public course to be renewed till 2030.\n\nFor TMCC, which will have 10 ha of its land acquired by the government for Changi Airport's new taxiways by the end of this year, reconfiguration work will start immediately, said the club's general manager Kok Min Yee.\n\nThis will be done while keeping the 18 holes still in play, he said. \"The reconfigurations should not cost us too much as it is not expected to be very extensive. It is hard to estimate the cost right now as we have not finalised the design as yet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, NSRCC, which will lose about 26 ha of land after its temporary occupation licence expires in August, is undertaking a strategic review to reconfigure the golf courses and provide more social facilities. The club will hold a townhall session next Monday to speak to members on its future plans.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If found guilty, she could be removed from office.\n\nThe troubled rice scheme, already near collapse, suffered another blow yesterday when the Government Savings Bank (GSB) said it was scrapping a loan to a state farm bank that could have been used to prop the scheme up, in the face of a revolt by depositors.\n\nThe GSB said on Sunday that it had lent five billion baht (S$194 million) to the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, which manages the rice programme and has all but run out of money to pay farmers.\n\nSome GSB depositors, either worried that the loan could destabilise the bank or unwilling to see their money used to help the government, have been taking out their cash. On Monday, 30 billion baht was withdrawn.\n\nYesterday's clashes were some of the most intense between protesters and security forces since the campaign to unseat Ms Yingluck began in November.\n\nYesterday's fatalities bring to 15 the number of people killed in sporadic violence between protesters, security forces and government supporters since the demonstrations began. Hundreds have been hurt.\n\nWitnesses heard gunfire and saw police firing weapons in the Phan Fa Bridge area in the old quarter of the city. Police said they had come under fire from a sniper on a rooftop and M-79 grenades were also fired. A policeman was killed by a gunshot and several were wounded by a grenade, security officials said.\n\nPolice said they had arrested 183 people at two protest sites at the Energy Ministry, which had been cleared of protesters, and Phan Fa Bridge, and were detaining them for violating a state of emergency declared last month.\n\nTrouble started with clouds of tear gas near Government House and soon police were crouching behind riot shields as officers clashed with protesters. It was not clear who had fired the tear gas, with the authorities blaming protesters.\n\nThere has so far been no move against the biggest protest sites in the city's commercial and shopping districts. The protesters are trying to oust Ms Yingluck, whom they view as a proxy for her elder brother Thaksin Shinawatra, a former telecoms tycoon-turned-premier, toppled by the army in a 2006 coup.\n\nAlso among the protesters' grievances is the rice subsidy scheme, a populist move to pay farmers an above-market price that has proved hugely expensive and run into serious funding problems.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Commission announced an investigation last month, and yesterday said it was summoning Ms Yingluck on Feb 27 to hear charges against her.\n\n\"Although she knew that many people had warned about corruption in the scheme, she still continued with it. That shows her intention to cause losses to the government, so we have unanimously agreed to charge her,\" Vicha Mahakhun, a member of the commission, said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

So we are making an extra effort to help the SMEs to adapt in this environment, and some of them are doing well.\"\n\nIt was a wide-ranging interview ranging from Singapore's domestic and economic policy to the progress made on Asean integration to his views on China.\n\nAsked how the Singapore government balanced the interests of SMEs against those of \"the state champions\", he replied that while there are companies owned directly or indirectly by the government through Temasek or other vehicles, these companies are required to operate commercially; their boards make decisions for them, and their shareholders hold the boards accountable for the companies' performance.\n\n\"So I would not say it's a division between state enterprises and the SMEs,\" he said.\n\nHe told Caixin that Singapore's roadmap to sustainable development is to be connected to the rest of the world, particularly South-east Asia.\n\nOn that note, he expressed confidence that Asean would achieve most of its goals of economic integration by 2015, which would result in more growth and freer flow of capital and talent in the region. \"We will probably meet, maybe, 85 per cent of what we have set out to do. It will not be the same as European economic integration, but it will be a significant step forward for Asean,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee also told the magazine that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a major multilateral cooperation effort, is close to completion this year.\n\nThe TPP - which encompasses 12 member nations, including the United States, Chile, Peru, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia - goes beyond trade deals to deal with tariffs and market access, with discussions on protection for companies that compete against government- backed businesses and stricter safeguards for patents and copyright.\n\nAsked about competition between Singapore and Hong Kong, Mr Lee said this was not a major concern to him as both countries are positioned differently.\n\n\"Hong Kong is very successful economically, on the doorstep of China, servicing the Chinese market and taking full advantage of that. Singapore is in a different position, in South-east Asia.\n\n\"The Chinese market is important to us, but at the same time, we also focus on South-east Asia, on South Asia, India, and on the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee was also asked for his views on the role of the Chinese currency. He said he recognised that the Chinese government is taking a gradual approach to allowing the renminbi to play a greater role in international finance, and that there is still \"a major distance\" to go towards achieving full convertibility of the renminbi - as this will require China's capital account to be completely open, which \"will probably take some time\", he said.\n\nSingapore is among several countries with bilateral currency-swap agreements with China, and is competing with Hong Kong and London to become an offshore yuan hub.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

They asked not to be identified because the fund-raising is private.\n\nTPG is among private-equity firms that have been chasing distressed real estate assets since the US housing collapse and Europe's economic crisis depressed commercial property values worldwide. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company is seeking to capitalise on investor appetite for real estate at a time of low rates on fixed-income assets.\n\nTPG's property investments since late 2009 were ultimately bundled into an investment vehicle called TPG Real Estate I, and the new fund is known as TPGRE II, according to the 60-page presentation to prospective investors.\n\nTPGRE I contains 10 deals representing US$2.3 billion of equity that came from the firm's main buyout funds and separate accounts with institutional clients such as New Jersey's state pension fund and Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate arm of the Canadian pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec.\n\nDeals in TPGRE I include stakes in North American homebuilder Taylor Morrison Home Corp, Catellus Development Corp, office landlord Parkway Properties Inc and European warehouses. The firm also owns office buildings in London and Silicon Valley.\n\nTPG seeks to buy property assets and companies at discounts to underlying net asset values, according to the presentation. The firm has 16 people devoted to real estate in San Francisco, New York and London. Mr Davis, who has worked at TPG for 14 years, is a co-founder of Colony Capital LLC, led by Tom Barrack. He and Avi Banyasz are co-heads of TPG Real Estate.\n\nTPG's new fund would be among the largest opportunistic real estate funds, after two pools for Europe and the Asia-Pacific region being raised by Blackstone Group LP, according to Preqin Ltd. Many investors last year moved away from focusing on low-risk real estate and are looking for higher-risk, higher-return opportunities, the London-based research company said.\n\n\"There are clear signs of more momentum in the fundraising market,\" Preqin said in its 2014 global real estate report. A total of 451 funds seeking a combined US$150 billion of investor capital were raising money as of last month, the firm said. \"It remains very difficult for managers to stand out from the crowd.\"\n\nA total of 162 private real estate funds raised a combined US$76 billion last year, compared with 224 funds that gathered US$67 billion in 2012. Last year's total money raised was the most since US$141 billion was collected in 2008, Preqin said.\n\nTPG is planning to complete the first round of capital pledges by March 31, according to the investor-presentation document. The firm will charge a management fee of 65 basis points on committed capital and staggered fees on invested capital, starting at 1.5 per cent of the first US$50 million, dropping to 1.25 per cent on the next US$150 million and 75 basis points on amounts of more than US$200 million, according to the document. TPG would receive 20 per cent of any profits after an 8 per cent preferred return.\n\nTPG will contribute 2 per cent of the capital, or US$40 million based on the US$2 billion fund-raising target.\n\nTPG's hiring of Robert Weaver as a senior executive in October 2011 had spurred speculation that the firm would start a real estate fund. Mr Weaver was previously at Morgan Stanley, where his specialty was raising money from investors. Morgan Stanley's property-funds unit was the biggest real estate investor among Wall Street firms until the 2008 credit crisis.\n\nLast year, TPG acquired Assisted Living Concepts Inc, which operates a chain of residences for seniors. In 2009, TPG partnered Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group to invest in bankrupt lender Corus Bankshares Inc, gaining assets including apartments in Florida that it has been selling amid a recovery in the residential rental market. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

It was conferred the National Singapore Law Firm of the Year award for 2014, from a shortlist that included Drew & Napier, Rajah & Tann, WongPartnership and Stamford Law.\n\nAllen & Gledhill also racked up 12 Band 1 rankings - the highest ranking a firm can achieve for various categories of Singapore law. This was also double the number of Band 1 rankings achieved by any other local law firm.\n\nRajah & Tann received six Band 1 rankings, while Drew & Napier and WongPartnership each received five Band 1 rankings.\n\nDrew & Napier's CEO Davinder Singh SC was also one of two - and the only Singaporean - to be given Chambers' prestigious Outstanding Achievement award, in recognition of his exceptional work in the dispute resolution field.\n\nThe publication's sources highlighted Mr Singh's excellent reputation for both litigation and arbitration work, with one saying: \"The Davinder factor puts this practice in a different league.\"\n\nOnly two of these awards are given out each year; the other award was given to Kenneth Siegel, managing partner of Morrison & Foerster LLP's Tokyo office.\n\nMr Singh was also one of six Singapore-based partners to receive the sought-after \"Star Individuals\" ranking - a recognition of exceptional individual achievement in their respective fields. These persons rank above those who have been given the Band 1 ranking in the individual category.\n\nHe was named a \"Star Individual\" for Dispute Resolution - Litigation. The other \"Star Individuals\" were: John Richards of Allen & Overy, for Banking & Finance - International; William McCormack of Shearman & Sterling, for Projects & Infrastructure; Bertie Mehigan of O'Melveny & Myers, for Restructuring/Insolvency; and Michael Hwang SC and Michael Charles Pryles, both as most-in-demand arbitrators.\n\nLucien Wong of Allen & Gledhill was named \"Senior Statesman\" in the areas of Banking & Finance - Domestic and Corporate/M&A - Domestic.\n\nAccording to Chambers, a \"Senior Statesman\" is a lawyer who no longer works hands-on with the same intensity but who, by virtue of close links with major clients, remains pivotal to the firm's success.\n\nThe Chambers rankings, out yearly, are arguably the most keenly watched and closely followed of all global legal rankings. Divided into various geographical regions, the rankings are the result of lengthy and thorough independent research, including interviews with several thousand lawyers and clients for the Asia-Pacific guide alone.\n\nKoay Shi-Ning, editor of Chambers' Asia-Pacific guide, commented on the Singapore scene: \"Singapore continues to be an exciting and vibrant market. This intense activity has resulted in continued development of our Singapore chapter.\"\n\nShe added that research for the Singapore chapter took place against a backdrop of growing competition among both domestic and international law firms. Increasingly, the top international firms are offering access to both international and Singapore law advice, while the larger domestic firms are expanding into the South-east Asian region.\n\nMilbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy was named International Singapore firm of the year, chosen out of a shortlist that included Allen & Overy LLP, Clifford Chance LLP, King & Spalding and Linklaters.\n\nClifford Chance achieved five Band 1 rankings in the firm rankings, the largest number among the international firms in Singapore. Baker Mckenzie.Wong & Leow and Allen & Overy were next in line with four Band 1 rankings each.\n\nMs Koay also noted that arbitration continues to be one of the most fiercely competitive practice areas. Herbert Smith Freehills maintained its Band 1 ranking here, while the increasingly prominent King & Spalding joined them in the top band.\n\nChambers also added four new tables this year: 1) Private client/Wealth Management, reflecting the Republic's growing reputation as a wealth management centre; 2) Employment; 3) Competition/Anti-trust, both a reflection of the growing number of specialists working in these practice areas here; and 4) the English Bar, a table recommending the leading English barristers active in Singapore-based arbitrations, following a flurry of UK sets moving into Singapore in the past couple of years.\n\n\"Our research shows that the English Bar is competing with local and international law firms for prime arbitration instructions in Singapore and in the wider South-east Asian region. Following amendments to the Singaporean Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill in 2012, the sets are also well positioned to start picking up work in the Singapore courts going forward,\" Ms Koay noted.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

They believe exports could pick up in the coming months to put on a better showing this year, compared to the bleak performance last year.\n\nThe pull-back in January's NODX, while expected, came in sharper than thought. The median forecast by a Bloomberg poll of 16 economists, before International Enterprise (IE) Singapore released the data yesterday morning, was for a 1.2 per cent decline.\n\nThe main drag was a 17 per cent contraction in electronics NODX in January, after a 3.1 per cent decline in the previous month. This, too, was well below the market's consensus forecast for a 4.3 per cent decline in electronics NODX.\n\nThe weak performance in PC-related product groups - such as disk drives (-31.5 per cent) and PC parts (-19.4 per cent) - outweighed the 3.5 per cent rise in non-electronics NODX, which followed a 10.6 per cent increase in December.\n\nSeveral economists said that January's feeble showing was likely skewed by the new year lull, which resulted in fewer working days and therefore suppressed export performance.\n\n\"We expect some of this weakness was due to Chinese New Year,\" said ANZ economist Daniel Wilson, who highlighted the fact that the top three contributors to the NODX contraction in January were Hong Kong (-21 per cent), Korea (-34.7 per cent), and Taiwan (-7.1 per cent).\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah added that \"it pays to note that (January's) decline has more to do with short-term seasonal factors, rather than underlying fundamentals\".\n\nMonth-on-month, the NODX reversed a seasonally-adjusted 6.3 per cent expansion in December to post a 5 per cent decrease in January, due to declines in both electronic and non-electronic NODX. Private sector economists had been expecting a contraction of 0.8 per cent.\n\nNon-oil re-exports (NORX), however, continued to rise last month, but the pace moderated to a year-on-year increase of 9 per cent, after growth of 14.2 per cent in December. Both electronic and non-electronic NORX rose in January.\n\nCiti economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan pointed out that there remains some divergence between stronger NORX (which represents regional trade trends), and lacklustre NODX (which represents demand for domestic manufacturing).\n\n\"This could suggest that Singapore's manufacturing demand continues to underperform the region,\" said Mr Kit and Mr Tan.\n\nAlthough January's NODX got off to a weak start, economists are treating the sub-par performance as a mere \"downside blip\". This is due to expectations of a steady global recovery - particularly in the United States, the eurozone, and Japan - which will provide a boost to Singapore's export demand later this year.\n\nSaid UOB economist Francis Tan: \"This can already be seen in the improving manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers' index) numbers where it showed that developed markets' purchasing managers were generally more optimistic compared to their emerging market counterparts. Coupled with a low NODX base in 2013, we think that 2014 NODX will come in stronger.\"\n\nUOB's 2014 NODX growth forecast stands at 7 per cent - significantly higher than IE Singapore's projection of 1-3 per cent.\n\nExcept for China, the European Union, the US, and Indonesia, NODX to all of Singapore's top 10 markets fell last month.\n\nWith final Q4 2013 GDP figures due for release this Thursday, economists polled by Bloomberg expect the government's flash estimate of 4.4 per cent growth to be revised upwards, to 4.9 per cent year-on-year.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

However, the leases on its courses will be renewed.\n\nThe acquisition will affect six holes of its 18-hole Garden course, three tennis courts and two storage sheds, but the government will compensate the club. The amount is to be pegged to the market value of the land as at yesterday, when it was gazetted by the Singapore Land Authority.\n\nFion Phua, a golf membership broker, said: \"They are being compensated with money, and land lease is being extended. Rightfully, their membership value should go up.\"\n\nThe membership value of TMCC is now about $118,000, compared with about $140,000 at the beginning of last year.\n\nUncertainty over the lease renewals has weighed on the membership prices for golf clubs with leases expiring within a decade.\n\nNow that the fate of these golf clubs has been made clearer, their membership prices may have room to recover, given that most will have their leases renewed, said golf membership brokers.\n\nAnother reason that their prices will be supported is that there will be fewer courses left, said Lee Lee Langdale, another broker, noting that Keppel Club will be gone, and that the Singapore Island Country Club (SICC) will lose up to two courses.\n\nFor both Keppel Club and SICC, the outlook for membership prices is less positive.\n\nThe government said on Sunday that it will not renew the lease for Keppel Club when it ends in 2021.\n\nOne of the SICC's four golf courses will be made public, while the course next to it will be given a lease only until 2030, with the possibility that it could also be made public then too.\n\nThe government had, after talks with the club's general committee, initially decided on SICC's Bukit golf courses for this purpose, on the assumption that SICC would prefer not to give up its bigger Island location, where the club recently put more than $100 million into a clubhouse.\n\nBut after SICC members questioned at a briefing on Sunday why the Bukit location was chosen, the government said that it would leave the decision to them, subject to certain criteria.\n\nThe SICC membership price would certainly go down, said Ms Phua.\n\n\"Basically a four-room HDB flat has become 21/2-room HDB flat, so it'll come down. The lease may be longer, but you have to open your backyard to share with the public,\" she said.\n\nNonetheless, businessman and SICC member Ron Song was sanguine about the value of the club's membership, saying that members join to enjoy the facilities, not to sell their membership.\n\nKeppel Club members, on the other hand, face the double whammy of having no golf course to play on in seven years and the possibility of higher golf club membership prices at other clubs. Some told The Business Times they will play in Malaysia and Bintan instead.\n\nThe fourth club affected by Sunday's announcements, the National Service Resort Country Club at Changi, is open only to existing and former NSmen, so its membership is not transferrable on the open market.\n\nYesterday, Orchid Country Club, offered a final seven-year lease till Dec 2030, told members that it welcomed the offer of the lease extension; it is awaiting more details, such as on the amount of land premium payable, and will study the financial implications for the club in the meantime.\n\nSome 200 ha of 1,500 ha of golf course land will be freed up for other uses by 2030, as the government moves to use these plots of land at a higher intensity.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Banks have guided for softer loan growth this year amid flat margin growth.\n\nDBS core net profit in Q4 rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $802 million, on the back of a 10 per cent gain in total income. But including one-off items, DBS's Q4 net income fell 20 per cent year on year to $973 million.\n\nIts earnings, which missed market expectations, were hit by a shortfall in non-interest income - or income derived from fees charges - said CIMB Research in an analyst report yesterday.\n\n\"The main concerns were whether a spillover from China's shadow banking cracks will affect DBS,\" said CIMB, which noted that most of DBS's China business comes from trade loans to Singapore-domiciled entities that fund trade finance flows originating from China.\n\n\"Although trade finance margins have come off since H2 2012, the loans are short-term in nature, have clear collateral and negligible default risk. DBS believes the flow is real and will not go away.\"\n\nA research note from Nomura also highlighted disappointment over DBS's asset quality in India.\n\n\"The India mid-size corporate portfolio still appears to be under pressure,\" it said.\n\nLike DBS, OCBC Bank benefited from strong trade-finance growth from China-related loans. It recorded a Q4 net profit of $715 million, up 8 per cent from a year ago.\n\n\"We view OCBC to be as aggressive as DBS in the regional trade finance business,\" said CIMB.\n\nCIMB also noted that OCBC had emerged stronger from a competition for time deposits at the end of 2013, boosting both deposit growth and net interest margin over the quarter.\n\nAccording to CIMB, OCBC management has said that funding cost pressures could be eased partly through higher mortgage spreads, given the impending end of a refinancing cycle for \"a vintage of high-spreads mortgages\".\n\n\"The stock has floundered on concerns over the Wing Hang deal. We believe the negatives are priced in,\" it added.\n\nAs for United Overseas Bank (UOB), the lender posted an 11.1 per cent increase in Q4 net profit to $773 million, and boasted a strong net interest margin in comparison to its peers.\n\n\"We expect benign cre-dit cost, as asset quality remains resilient, while fee income growth is expected to be sustained at double digits given the momentum seen in the bank's wealth management and fee-based businesses,\" said DMG & Partners Security in a note.\n\nCIMB, which now ranks UOB as its top pick, highlighted the consistent growth of fee income at Singapore's smallest bank by market capitalisation over the last four years. Part of UOB's strength has come from creating teams that work on deals for specific industries. This, according to guidance from UOB, has expanded the deal pipeline by at least two times.\n\nAccording to CIMB, UOB does not expect funding cost for Singapore dollars to rise immediately, but this could be a concern in about a year's time.\n\nYesterday, shares of DBS rose 0.67 per cent to $16.59, OCBC was up 0.85 per cent at $9.46, and UOB surged 2.56 per cent to $20.41.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After landing, he left the aircraft via a cockpit window, without harming passengers or crew, police spokesman Pierre Grangean said, \"Just after landing, the co-pilot came out of the cockpit and ran to the police and said, 'I'm the hijacker.' He said he is not safe in his own country and wants asylum,\" Mr Grangean said.\n\nFlight ET702 departed the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on Sunday evening and was bound for Rome. The plane was hijacked at about 0330GMT while over northern Italy, Mr Grangean said. It landed at Geneva at 6.02 am (0502GMT).\n\nHe said the co-pilot, an Ethiopian born in 1983, locked the flight deck door when the pilot went to the toilet. He then asked to refuel at Geneva, landed the plane, climbed down on an emergency exit rope from a cockpit window, and gave himself up.\n\nA flight tracking app for mobile devices showed the flight circling over the Swiss city several times before landing.\n\nRobert Deillon, CEO of Geneva airport, said air traffic controllers learnt the plane had been hijacked when the co-pilot keyed a distress code into the aircraft's transponder, \"There is . . . a code for hijack. So this co-pilot put in the code for 'I just hijacked the aircraft',\" he said. As the plane was over Italy at the time, two Italian Eurofighters were scrambled to accompany it, he said.\n\nState-run Ethiopian television said there were 193 passengers on board the Boeing aircraft, including 140 Italian nationals.\n\nThe brief drama in Geneva yesterday morning caused the cancellation of some short-haul flights and some incoming flights were diverted to other airports.

Containers represent an opportunity to those businesses,\" he explained.\n\nWhile buying in bulk can sometimes be economical, it also can put pressure on an importer's working capital. A standard 20-foot shipping container holds only around 20 tonnes of grain. \"Credit lines haven't really gone up the way food prices have increased,\" said a Singapore-based trader, who sells South American corn and soyameal in Asia.\n\nUS containerised grain exports to Asia have more than doubled since 2006 to reach 470,832 20-foot containers in the first 10 months of 2013, up 10 per cent from the year before, according to US Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.\n\nAnalysts estimate that 12 to 15 per cent of Australia's grain exports are now shipped in containers to Asia. \"We know that the grain trade in containers is growing, especially in Australia because of the proximity to the far eastern markets,\" said Yuri Makarov, a senior economist at the International Grains Council.\n\nAsia is the top destination for grain container shipments, but brisk trade also takes place from Latin America to Europe and Europe to the Middle East.\n\nAround 12 per cent of global trade in agricultural goods such as oilseeds and grains, traditionally shipped in bulk, was shipped via container in 2012, data from shipping consultancy Seabury Group showed.\n\nContainers offer a more flexible option for smaller exporters as well as importers.\n\n\"Unless we are talking about the major agricultural trade houses, most farmers cannot fill one ship alone,\" said Jan Tiedemann, a shipping analyst with consultancy Alphaliner. \"With containers it's different. A farmer can theoretically sell 100 tonnes of grain on eBay and ship it to China.\"\n\nThe cost of shipping sugar from Brazil to China in containers can vary from nearly zero to US$20 per tonne, compared with up to US$70 per tonne in bulk, Bas Van Goor, a sugar trader at agriculture trade house RCMA said.\n\n\"The advantage is clear for the shipper, who benefits from the flexibility of their commodity being moved in smaller shipment sizes allowing them to quickly reach many different locations,\" said Vincent Clerc, chief trade and marketing officer with the world's biggest container shipping firm, Maersk Line.\n\nFuture growth in food container trade to some extent depends on the global demand for Asian manufactured goods, which makes empty containers available in food-exporting countries. \"We rely on the American consumer to do their part in keeping this a liquid business. It makes it more challenging to find a container for your shipment if the American consumer didn't buy a Barbie doll or a Dell computer out of that container last week,\" AgriLogistics' Mr Bickford added. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

That's one way we can drive higher-yielding visitorships. That will continue to be a focus for us.\"\n\nMr Yeo added that Singapore would work on bringing in more quality meetings, incentive travel, conferences & exhibitions (MICE) events, given that the business travel and MICE segment (BTMICE) tends to spend more on average than leisure travellers.\n\nThe Republic has been seeking out more discerning travellers who are willing to pay a premium for unique experiences, on expectations that the high growth rates in visitor arrivals and tourism spend of recent years are no longer sustainable, due to labour constraints and regional competition.\n\nDerek Tan, an analyst at DBS Group Research, maintains that tourism receipts will hit $26 billion for 2014, while visitor arrivals will climb to 16.3 million. Meanwhile, communications director for Dynasty Travel Alicia Seah expects that the overall tourism industry will benefit this year from the upcoming Sports Hub, the pick-up in the US economy as well as the return of biennial MICE events such as the Singapore Airshow.\n\nThe STB is expected to release its 2014 projections for the industry's performance in coming months.\n\nFor the nine months from January to September 2013, spend from leisure travellers climbed 10 per cent year on year to $6.29 billion, even as BTMICE spend slumped 6 per cent to $4.1 billion, which STB attributed to tighter corporate budgets amid an uncertain global economy.\n\nThis is despite a 6 per cent increase in the number of BTMICE arrivals for the same period. The full-year figures are not available as yet.\n\nRobert McIntosh, executive director of CBRE Hotels (Asia Pacific), noted that the growth in the total number of hotel room nights sold was smaller than the increase in visitor arrivals, which could be cause for concern, especially since Singapore is trying to improve the quality of visitorship.\n\n\"They're spending less money, or less time in hotels than they were before,\" he said.\n\nFor the nine-month period, Indonesia remained the top visitor-generating country for Singapore, followed by China and Malaysia.\n\nLast year, hoteliers saw a marginal softening in operating indicators as the industry absorbed a 6.5 per cent increase in room supply, taking the total number of hotel rooms here to 54,962. Gazetted hotel room revenue grew 3.9 per cent year on year to some $2.9 billion. The average occupancy rate slid one percentage point to a still-healthy 86 per cent, while the average room rate declined from $262 in 2012 to $258 in 2013. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) worked out to $223, down slightly from $226.\n\nWhen comparing the data across hotel categories, it was a mixed bag. Luxury hotels had the best run last year, emerging with a 9 per cent jump in RevPAR, while other categories - upscale, mid-tier and economy - all suffered declines in RevPAR with mid-tier hotels seeing the smallest drop and upscale hotels being hit the hardest.\n\nBut even with a further 3,000 hotel rooms coming onstream this year, STB expects that the industry would be able to soak up the inventory.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The shadow economy comprises people who can't find a full-time or regular job. People range from artisans, cleaners, gardeners, vendors and even specialists in IT and Web designs. These workers, who receive cash and either pay no tax or only a portion to the Inland Revenue Services (IRS), are part of this shadow, informal economy.\n\nSince unemployment in developed nation members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has remained at around 47 million people and the International Labour Organisation estimates that globally the jobless total 202 million, masses of men and women scrape a living in the shadow economy. The underground economy also comprises drug dealing and other illegal activities which have boosted money laundering around the world. Legal and illegal immigrants who cannot obtain formal jobs and neither pay tax nor social insurance also tend to be participants in the informal economy.\n\nThe informal economy has been prevalent in emerging nations for decades, but since the great recession, it has grown in tandem with unemployment in the developed world. In Spain, Greece and other stricken European economies, shadow transactions have risen considerably and account for a sizeable share of the overall size of the economy (see table). Statistics on the informal economy vary considerably. In China, it was estimated that 160 million people worked in the underground economy - 22 per cent of the official labour force, estimates the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). In India, just over two hundred million people worked illicitly - around 50 per cent of the official labour force. In Indonesia, the third-most populous country in this group, 36.7 million people were engaged in informal economic activities; this corresponds to 37 per cent of the official labour force. On the whole, the informal economy labour force in these Asian countries made up 47 per cent of the official labour force and 20 per cent of the population, according to some estimates.\n\nA study by Edgar L Feige, Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, estimates that underground activity in the US totalled a whopping US$2 trillion, equivalent to 13.3 per cent of the US economy. In a recent interview, Prof Feige said that there was \"no question this shadow economy has been increasing dramatically in the last two or three years\". Since 1997, it has doubled in the US economy and is now approaching the records last seen during World War II when there were strict price controls and rationing.\n\nThe underground economy is a double edged sword. On the positive side, the workers are also consumers and their consumption boosts the global economy. Also unemployment rates may be overstating the degree of unemployment because it does not measure those working unofficially, maintains Prof Feige.\n\nOn the negative side, those working and not paying the taxes place a burden on those who pay their taxes, economists say. Taxes could be lower if the government were able to obtain more revenue from the underground economy instead of raising taxes on employees and businesses who are following the law. Prof Feige estimates that the IRS in the US loses about US$400-500 billion. The figures also illustrate that the State has less to spend on education, hospitals and other departments which would also benefit underground workers who need these services. Moreover, unscrupulous employers also exploit immigrants and other illegal workers by paying them under the minimum wage and make them work many hours.\n\nA study by the IEA says that there could be three broad policy options for dealing with the shadow economy: doing nothing which leaves intact the existing negative impacts on legitimate and shadow work as well as on customers and governments; second, eradication which would stamp out the entrepreneurship and enterprise culture that governments wish to nurture. The third measure is to legitimise the shadow economy by making it more formal. This, according to some economists, would involve tax reform, notably much lower taxation in the country, to encourage more people to declare all their earnings, and wider sales tax and other indirect taxation.\n\nRussia is a prime example as individual taxation was cut to a flat rate of 13 per cent and as a result, the country drew in more revenue.\n\nProf Feige proposes a single comprehensive \"revenue neutral\" Automated Payment Transaction (APT) tax. \"It would be a flat-rate tax levied on all voluntary transactions, hitting the broadest conceivable tax base and therefore requiring the lowest conceivable marginal tax rate.\"\n\nAPT would \"significantly lower corporate and individual income tax rates by using the revenues obtained from taxing financial transactions\", he contends.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Billionaire John Paulson maintained his bullion holdings last quarter.\n\nThe net-long position climbed 17 per cent to 69,291 futures and options in the week ended Feb 11, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Long wagers rose 8.8 per cent, the most since March. Net-bullish holdings across 18 US-traded commodities rose 18 per cent to 1.07 million contracts, the highest since October 2012, led by silver and coffee.\n\nInvestors' return to bullion after the bear market in 2013 is driving prices to longest rally since 2011. US factory output unexpectedly fell in January and emerging market equities and currencies weakened. Mr Paulson, the biggest owner of the largest exchange-traded product, left his holdings unchanged in the fourth quarter, a government filing showed. Goldman Sachs Group and Barclays plc say the rebound will falter.\n\n\"The run-up in prices in recent weeks has been attached to the meltdown in emerging markets, and adding to that concern is US economic news,\" said John Rutledge, chief investment strategist at Safanad. \"It's still probably too soon to say the trend in gold market has fully turned. You've got people who are bears because they see inflation as under control, and others looking further ahead seeing inflation.\"\n\nFutures in New York rose 4.4 per cent last week to US$1,318.60 an ounce, posting eight straight gains, the best streak since July 2011. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials climbed 0.8 per cent, while the MSCI All-Country World index of equities advanced 2.4 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, fell 0.6 per cent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index lost 0.1 per cent. Gold rose another 0.7 per cent yesterday.\n\nHoldings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETP backed by bullion, climbed for three weeks, the longest stretch since August. Paulson & Co held 10.23 million shares as of Dec 31, unchanged from Sept 30 and valued at about US$1.19 billion, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing made on Feb 14.\n\nUS retail sales fell in January by the most since June 2012, and jobless claims unexpectedly rose in the week to Feb 8, government data showed. Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen said on Feb 11 the recovery in the US labour market is \"far from complete\".\n\nGold jumped 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the central bank pumped more than US$2 trillion into the financial system.\n\nPrices plunged 28 per cent last year, the most since 1981, after some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value. In November, Mr Paulson told clients that he personally wouldn't invest more money in his bullion fund because it was unclear when inflation would quicken. Gold held in global ETPs tumbled 33 per cent in 2013, and the value of the assets dropped US$73 billion.\n\nThis year's rally will \"flounder\" absent a \"more meaningful shift\" in investor sentiment, Barclays analysts said in a Feb 14 note. Goldman analysts led by Jeffrey Currie, the head of commodities research, said in a report two days earlier that gold will \"grind lower\" as US growth improves, reiterating a forecast for prices to reach US$1,050 by the end of the year.\n\nThe Fed cut monthly bond buying by US$10 billion at each of its past two meetings, leaving purchases at US$65 billion. Ms Yellen said last week reductions will continue in \"measured steps\". The US personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy costs, rose 1.2 per cent in 2013, matching 2009 as the smallest gain since 1955.\n\n\"Gold may be establishing a bottom, but there are still a lot of headwinds,\" said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp in New York. \"Yellen said that the tapering is going to continue, and inflation is still low.\"\n\nInvestors became bullish on silver, holding 7,675 contracts as of Feb 11, the CFTC data showed. That compares with a net-short position of 353 contracts a week earlier. Futures rose for 10 straight sessions through Feb 14, the longest streak since March 2008. In January, demand for silver coins sold by the US Mint almost quadrupled.\n\nBullish bets on crude oil climbed 11 per cent to 306,021 contracts, the highest since August, government data show. West Texas Intermediate advanced to the highest price in almost four months on Feb 12. Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for the futures, shrank to the lowest since Nov 1, the Energy Information Administration reported the same day.\n\nSpeculators expanded their net-bearish position in copper to 15,792 contracts, from 6,832 the previous week. Prices in New York climbed for two weeks, the longest rally this year. Refined imports in China, the world's biggest metals consumer, increased 53 per cent in January from a year earlier to a record.\n\nA measure of speculative positions across 11 agricultural products jumped 30 per cent to the highest since late October, the CFTC data show. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of eight commodities capped a third straight weekly gain, the longest run since August. The measure is rebounding after tumbling 22 per cent in 2013, the most since 1981.\n\nThe net-long position in arabica coffee surged 97 per cent to 15,728 contracts, the highest since September 2011. Futures in New York gained 29 per cent this year, the most among the 24 commodities tracked by the GSCI. In Brazil, the top producer of coffee, sugar and oranges, the driest January since 1954 drained dams and seared plants. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

However, the financing options are far from being finalised.\n\nWhile the type of financing has not been decided yet - and may ultimately include municipal bonds - at least two European banks have proposed the idea of securitising the lease cashflows from a new set of shops and concessions planned for the revitalised terminal.\n\nAdditionally, income from landing fees - including penalty charges for flights taking off or landing late - may be securitised as well, the sources said. \"LaGuardia would make so much money if they chose the securitisation option,\" said the head of ABS at an international bank. \"It seems like such an obvious option. Other airports have used this concept to great success.\"\n\nAdditionally, developing a shopping, dining and entertainment complex at the airport - which would bring in increased lease cashflows to be securitised - would make the airport a destination for patrons other than those taking flights. Hong Kong International Airport is one example of successful execution of this type of concept, the banker said.\n\n\"Securitisation would be an attractive route for LaGuardia to come to market, and it would be an interesting evolution in the US infrastructure market\", said another senior UK-based DCM banker. \"The same drivers exist in the US as in the UK to utilise that funding structure. It's just that the UK has a different legislative/ regulatory environment, and is more creditor-friendly.\"\n\nUK airports operator BAA, owned by Grupo Ferrovial, used whole-business securitisations - which securitise all of the operating assets of a brand - for infrastructure projects on its airports, including Heathrow.\n\nSimilarly, The AA, a UK roadside recovery business, priced a WBS last summer. \"There is scope to look at these UK examples and find better solutions and funding platforms rather than a more vanilla option in the US,\" the DCM banker said. \"However, it might have to be in an amended form, given the different regulatory environment in the US.\"\n\nThe main advantages of a WBS-style structure would be to provide so- called ringfencing around the assets, as well as an element of ratings uplift or leverage uplift, the bankers said. - IFR\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The initial information, however, is likely to be limited to the number of units sold in an ongoing development.\n\n\"The ministry has all the information from the developers and I am sharing this information,\" the minister said, to enable purchasers to know at a glance which properties are still available and at what price range.\n\nMr Abdul Rahman also spoke about introducing new rules to curb bulk purchasing which had contributed to significant price increases in recent years.\n\n\"My ministry will also enforce a new condition for selling houses in bulk or en bloc, whereby developers who intend to make bulk sales of more than four units must obtain prior approval from the controller of housing. This condition will be prescribed as a mandatory requirement in every advertisement and sale permit for housing development,\" he said at the launch of the Sime Darby Property Housing-Income Index study yesterday.\n\nWhile bulk discounts are not illegal, he said, the practice of property investor clubs obtaining a discount of some 20 per cent of the price from a developer and then on-selling it to their members at slightly below list price while pocketing the difference, is not healthy. Rehda, the housing developers' association, has, however, asked for \"modified restrictions\".\n\nMr Abdul Rahman said that a comprehensive database of house buyers would be established to enable the ministry to \"identify the number of houses owned by an individual and take the necessary steps to curb unhealthy speculation\".\n\nThe housing sector has slowed down since the October budget introduced a number of cooling measures following annual price increases of more than a tenth in the past few years in Malaysia's biggest cities.\n\nBut prices remain sticky for now, owing to a number of factors including the holding power of owners, the belief that prices will only increase in future and because of the scarcity of land in popular areas as well as higher inflation. Indeed, builders insist that prices are unlikely to drop although a few have said that they would start to build more affordable houses - nationally defined as units priced below RM400,000 (S$152,000).\n\nGiven escalating land prices, this will be difficult in the Klang Valley, Penang and parts of Johor Bahru. For a snapshot of the Klang Valley scene, the Sime Darby housing-income index study found that the mean household income of respondents in 12 selected locations in the greater Kuala Lumpur area (includes Nilai in Negri Sembilan) to be RM14,580 per month.\n\nSime's housing-income index was designed to enable individuals to estimate their mortgage affordability based on price-to-income ratio (PIR), mortgage-to-income ratio (MIR), and the housing affordability index (HAI) which measures whether the average family in a location qualifies for a loan on a typical house there.\n\nThe PIR revealed an affordable house price in the Klang Valley to be about 56 times the monthly household income (compared to the UN's average of 50 times), and that 26 per cent of monthly household income is used to service the mortgage. The HAI found households in Nilai which earn an average of RM9,430 to be more likely to qualify for a loan than those in Mont Kiara-Duta Hartamas where household income averaged RM20,160. (This is because the latter group is likely to be more leveraged). The sample size of 1,529 respondents comprised mainly middle to upper income. Some 28 per cent were Sime Darby homeowners.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He was nonchalant on hearing about the death knell for the nation's car manufacturing industry. After commiserating with the affected workers, he limited himself to expressing the hope that the workforce would move \"from good jobs to better jobs\". Last week, Toyota Motors decided to stop making cars in Australia from 2017. The decision comes hard on the heels of announcements by Ford and GM to quit manufacturing in the country, and spells the end of a A$20 billion (S$22.7 billion) industry. Together with engine, gearbox, seats and other car part makers, the combined industry employs upwards of 30,000 workers. Some economists predict that these closures will trigger a recession in those states where the car factories are located.\n\nA few weeks earlier, Mr Abbott's government refused a A$25 million bailout to keep a fruit processing plant going. It has been speculated that the country's last fruit cannery, SPC Ardmona, could announce its closure by the end of this month with a loss of 1,600 jobs. Such a shutdown would ripple across the broader farm economy in the region. The plant has lost more than A$400 million in the past five years.\n\nSo far, so consistent. But Mr Abbott's government has a long way to go if it wants to end the subsidy mentality that many Australian businesses have come to expect as a matter of right. One major Sydney newspaper, using figures from the government's own Productivity Commission, has tallied the tax breaks and outright grants that various industries enjoy. Remarkably, one of the most coddled is its financial services industry. It has been given subsidies exceeding A$900 million, including tax breaks of more than A$840 million and direct grants of about A$70 million. Even more surprising, the mining industry enjoys tax breaks of A$300 million and direct grants of another A$400 million. Yet, the mineral extraction business has always painted itself as the sturdy engine that pulls along the rest of Australia's economy.\n\nThe gas, water and electricity suppliers receive direct grants of over A$1 billion and consumers (read voters) are kept happy. The other super-large subsidy system is for farmers. The primary production industry gets tax breaks of A$548 million and rakes in another A$891 million in direct handouts. And, because of the drought in certain parts of the country, there are cries for more taxpayer aid. But, unlike the factory workers who live in urban areas and tend to vote for the opposition Australian Labour Party, farmers constitute the bulwark for the rural-based National Party - junior partners in the ruling coalition. Although his government has so far stood firm against more subsidies and farmers were invited to debate sustainable agriculture in Australia instead, there are signs that some form of assistance will be forthcoming. Mr Abbott will be well advised to resist the pressure. His economic credentials will be judged on this issue.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The remaining 50 charges against him will be taken into consideration for his sentencing.\n\nThe prosecution yesterday asked for Lim to be jailed for 18 months for his offences - six months for each charge, and for at least three of the charges to run consecutively.\n\nLim, who is suffering from a number of ailments including kidney disease and diabetes, turned up in court yesterday seemingly all ready to serve his jail time. He brought with him, among various things, a bag containing his supply of medication - and had even changed his metal spectacle frames to plastic ones, as no metal is allowed in prisons here.\n\nHowever, District Judge Eddy Tham will sentence Lim on Thursday.\n\nLim had served as the highest-ranking protocol officer at MFA before he was charged last October. The long-serving civil servant was then in charge of the MFA directorate responsible for organising ministerial and presidential visits, and oversaw policies on diplomatic privileges and immunities.\n\nHe was accused of cheating the ministry of almost $90,000, between February 2008 and May 2012, by inflating the claims he made on thousands of boxes of pineapple tarts and hundreds of bottles of wine supposedly bought for official ministerial trips. For example, he would claim for 200 boxes of pineapple tarts when only 50 were used.\n\nIn making their case for Lim's sentence yesterday, deputy public prosecutors Kelvin Kow and Gregory Gan argued that Lim's actions were \"an egregious abuse of his position and a gross betrayal of the trust placed in him\". As the sums involved were taxpayers' money, the offences also \"constitute an assault on public weal\", they added.\n\nThey said his case has also \"generated much public disquiet and brought disrepute to the public service\", which has caused \"an intangible harm\" to the public service. They added that his actions were premeditated and deliberate, carried out over multiple occasions and a \"prolonged time period of four years\".\n\nIn mitigation, Lim's lawyer - Philip Fong, managing partner of Harry Elias Partnership - argued that there were extenuating circumstances surrounding his client's actions. He said Lim inflated the claims only to make up for the expenses he incurred in buying gifts for foreign diplomats whenever they hosted events in Singapore.\n\nMr Fong said Lim told him that it is not MFA's official policy to give gifts at such local functions; therefore, any MFA officials who gave gifts to these Singapore-based foreign diplomats would not be reimbursed for what they spent.\n\nSo, in his attempt to overcome what he felt was \"bureaucratic red tape\", Lim overstated his claims to make up for these expenses.\n\n\"His conduct was misguided but well-intentioned as it was for the purpose of using the excess claimed to purchase the gifts for foreign diplomats based in Singapore and overseas,\" Mr Fong argued.\n\n\"He did not obtain any benefit for himself. He did not pocket any money. He only did so as and when he felt he needed petty cash to purchase gifts for upcoming functions with foreign officials,\" Mr Fong added.\n\nHe also said his client had made significant contributions to the public service and had had a distinguished and illustrious career. He also said Lim was truly remorseful for his misconduct, had made full restitution, and admitted to his acts very early in the investigations into his case.\n\nIn arguing for a lower sentence, Mr Fong pointed to his client's ill health and advanced age, and the fact that he would likely \"face financial hardship in the years to come without the support of any pension\".\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

(The first hike, to take the tax rate from its current 5 per cent to 8 per cent, is to take place in April.)\n\nWeak consumer demand makes it more likely that the BOJ will need to announce further monetary-easing measures today or at a later date, economists say; its governor Haruhiko Kuroda has signalled the central bank's willingness to take fresh steps if needed.\n\nThis in turn implies that the yen could weaken even further than the roughly 20 per cent it has dropped against the US dollar and the euro last year; it has also declined against major Asian currencies.\n\nThe Tokyo stock market reacted little yesterday to the latest GDP data, as investors digested the implications while waiting to see what steps, if any, the BOJ will take today.\n\nDespite the weaker yen, growth in Japan's exports was sluggish in the final quarter of last year, especially to the US market; growth in exports to Asia increased, yesterday's data showed. Exports grew 0.4 per cent during the October-December period, after a 0.7 per cent fall in the preceding quarter.\n\nEconomic recovery last year was led by firm consumer spending, but consumer demand in the fourth quarter was weaker than what economists expected.\n\nHousehold spending rose only 0.5 per cent on quarter, against an expected rise of 0.7 per cent, Kyodo news agency noted.\n\nConsumption, accounting for around 60 per cent of GDP, rose a real 0.5 per cent, but this was due in part to a surge in demand ahead of the planned three-point sales tax hike in April.\n\nCorporate capital spending rose 1.3 per cent, and housing investment, 4.2 per cent.\n\nA critical factor for the continued success of Abenomics in the short term lies in the willingness of corporate Japan to raise wages - thus boosting consumption - in the upcoming \"spring wage offensive\", but so far, indications have not been positive in this regard.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank \"may provide trade financing with suppliers, hedge book services, etc to support Airbus's production and delivery efforts,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rob Stallard said.\n\nBoth Airbus and rival Boeing, which has an aircraft financing arm called Boeing Capital Corp, are increasing production after a boom in aircraft orders. Both companies face concerns about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. The bank is, however, seen as unlikely to handle the airline customer financing carried out by Airbus and which is already well established through a Dublin subsidiary.\n\nIndustrial companies have traditionally been wary of the increased regulatory scrutiny - potentially involving tens of millions of euros in extra audits and management time or processes - that such a move would bring.\n\nAirbus and Boeing both offer customer financing to support aircraft sales as a last resort - an activity that has recently rarely been used as Asian lenders step in to fill the gap left by once-dominant French banks.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

How can businesses and corporates contribute towards national defence?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 16, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBryce Boland\n\nCTO APAC\n\nFireEye\n\nTOTAL Defence has never been more relevant, but the threats and required responses have changed. The wealth and strength of a country resides not just in its land and its citizens. It also resides in the economy and intellectual property. This wealth is intrinsically tied to the global connectedness of the world through the Internet. This reliance on modern technology can be exploited from anywhere and is the new frontier for defence.\n\nCorporations and the government need to remain vigilant and continue to seek the best possible intelligence to ensure that these threats are understood and defeated. The economic impact from sustained cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, government and corporations could be enormous or even catastrophic. The defence of the nation requires the most advanced thinking possible, and we must not be complacent about addressing these hidden but growing threats to national security.\n\nKwek Leng Joo\n\nDeputy Chairman\n\nCity Developments Limited\n\nSINGAPORE'S economic progress and prosperity are founded on national security. Total Defence plays a vital role in safeguarding our city's present and future.\n\nAs a country limited by natural resources, building upon our core strengths - the peace, stability and security we enjoy - makes Singapore an attractive global trading and investment hub.\n\nIt is the responsibility of every citizen - both corporates and individuals alike - to contribute towards sustaining Singapore's national defence.\n\nAs a homegrown corporation with a 50-year-old growth story that parallels Singapore's nation building history, CDL recognises the importance of Total Defence in providing a conducive environment where businesses and people can flourish.\n\nSince 1999, we have introduced National Service (NS)-friendly policies that place high priority for our NSmen employees to fulfil their national duties. We have implemented various schemes and incentives to encourage them to be fit and diligent so that they can respond when called upon to carry out their national duties.\n\nWith proper manpower planning, CDL has achieved zero work deferment for over a decade. As an honorary member of the Minister for Defence Awards (MiDAS) League and on the Minister's Honour Roll (Star) accorded by the Home Team NS Awards for Employers, we wish to encourage more businesses to take on a proactive role in Total Defence. Supporting our NSmen employees is one way corporations can contribute to the nation's peace and security.\n\nTeo Lay Lim\n\nSenior Managing Director\n\nAccenture, Asean\n\nRISING citizen expectations, evolving crime types and shrinking budgets test the capabilities of police forces around the world. One way of overcoming these challenges is to tap into the power of analytics.\n\nAnalytics, which harness useful insights from disorganised data, can prove a valuable ally in combating crime. Singapore's new ''Safe City'' testbed is a step in this direction.\n\nAccenture is proud to be part of this one-year programme in which we are responsible for testing how advanced analytic capabilities may be integrated into the existing video monitoring systems used in the city. This will aid city authorities to improve situational awareness, streamline operations and enhance the response times to public safety incidents.\n\nAccenture's solution will also enable the relevant authorities to detect and monitor a variety of situations, including crowd and traffic movements, public disorder incidents and environmental threats such as flooding.\n\nWe continue to look forward to delivering innovative and advanced technology solutions that will help safeguard the welfare of the country and its citizens.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nSINGAPORE was a developing country when the concept of Total Defence was conceived 30 years ago.\n\nToday, we are a developed nation and our military, economy and social fabric are very much stronger compared to the early days.\n\nBut as much as the landscape has changed in the last three decades, I believe that the concept of Total Defence is still very relevant.\n\nOn a basic level, businesses have done their part in releasing male employees for reservist training, for example.\n\nHowever, the broader view of businesses' contribution towards national defence falls on the economic growth of organisations.\n\nIt is about growing Singapore's economy by developing strong companies that can compete on the world stage.\n\nThis calls for strong management so one key area to look into is to develop business leaders and strengthen their leadership skills through continuing education and exposure, not only to grow the company but for them to grow personally as well.\n\nUltimately, as Singapore prospers economically, the taxes that companies and individuals pay can be used for nation-building - to build military might, infrastructure and other essential components to help safeguard our future.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group Pte Ltd\n\nTOTAL defence is extremely important to the corporate community in Singapore. It has transcended the simple notion of protecting the country into a rally for a bigger cause.\n\nIn these times when social and economic pressures prevail more strongly than before, with more foreigners sharing space in Singapore, the integration of our citizens and foreign guests to further Total Defence is critical.\n\nAt our company events, we always make it a point to reflect upon how fortunate Ademco is to be headquartered here in Singapore. Stable government, pro-business policies, good health care and infrastructure are but simply a few of the many things worth protecting.\n\nThe constant reminders of how Singapore compares against our neighbours give fresh breath to our Total Defence movement. Corporate bosses should continue to place emphasis on Total Defence; it will go a long way to helping our people remain cohesive.\n\nDileep Nair\n\nAmbassador\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nBUSINESSES can only carry out what they are doing provided the country is peaceful and secure. Foreign investments will shun the place at the hint of threats to the country's security and well being.\n\nIt is therefore only logical that all businesses must give their full and wholehearted support to Total Defence.\n\nAside from supporting staff that have to go for regular reservist training, businesses can make available their resources for national defence purposes if needed.\n\nSidney Lim\n\nManaging Director, South-east Asia\n\nProtiviti Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Total Defence concept was first conceived in the 1980s before the rise of the Internet.\n\nWhile the concept is definitely still relevant, we should also consider the new risks faced by organisations in a changing environment, fuelled by rapid advances in technology, that could significantly threaten our national security.\n\nEnsuring privacy/identity management and information security protection; cyber threats that could significantly disrupt core operations - these issues continue to be at the top of the mind in a recent Protiviti survey of 400 global CEOs.\n\nThey present a moving target in terms of changing technology that makes security and privacy more complex and tougher to manage and control.\n\nAlthough new developments (for example, social business, mobile computing, new platforms and devices) present opportunities for companies to create new markets and disruptive business models, they also present fresh avenues for cyber attacks and mischief.\n\nAs part of Singapore's Total Defence strategy, both public and private organisations should ensure that they have a sound enterprise risk management system in place to protect themselves against these risks, as well as any confidential data and information leaks which could potentially harm our country.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nMORE than 20 years ago, Singaporeans debated widely a White Paper on Singapore's Shared Values. Parliament eventually adopted five statements as the nation's Shared Values on Jan 15, 1991.\n\nThe first value was ''Nation before community and society above self'': The spirit of putting the interests of society ahead of the individual. This is the backbone of Total Defence.\n\nFor a nation with finite and limited resources in both land and people, we all have to pitch in to contribute to the Total Defence of Singapore.\n\nIt is not just the job of the army, navy, air force, police or civil defence but every single person who resides in this country, be they Singaporeans, PR or foreigners working here.\n\nAs such, at the organisational level, companies regardless of national origin must play a part to ensure the security of this country which has provided them the environment to grow and thrive.\n\nDoing so ensures the safety and security of everyone residing here as well as the privilege of continuing to thrive in an economic powerhouse such as Singapore.\n\nAs a Singaporean company, we have always prided ourselves on our ardent support of Total Defence, by making readily available our resources in service of our country: Our modern fleet of quality heavy haulage, marine and logistical equipment such as mobile cranes, trucks, tugs and barges are ever ready to be deployed to keep our country strong, safe and secure.\n\nJanet Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nIBM Singapore\n\nEVERYONE has a role to play and Total Defence Day is an opportune time for us to bond with our fellow Singaporeans, strengthen our unity and be inspired towards a collective future.\n\nThe safe and secure environment helps to create a place where world-class facilities, infrastructure and talents converge to create exciting growth opportunities for all.\n\nAt IBM, we believe we have a part to play in strengthening these elements of Total Defence not just through the provision of IBM's leading innovation and analytical solutions for National Defence but also by inculcating in our workforce the importance of loyalty to our family and nation.\n\nAlick Chia\n\nDirector, Business Support\n\nSKF Asia Pacific Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE'S concept of Total Defence covering the five key components of military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence is a good strategy and an excellent approach. It will involve every Singaporean and every institution.\n\nIn recent times, it has been discovered in many countries that both corporations and rich individuals have been trying to avoid paying their share of taxes to their government.\n\nFor Singapore's total defence strategy to function well, it has to be financially supported. This could also mean that corporations and rich individuals should take responsibility to pay their taxes to help finance this strategy in the long term.\n\nResponsible companies and individuals should be committed to pay their taxes according to what they have benefited either operating here or as individuals living in this country.\n\nOur tax rate is already low, we should not try to avoid it at all.\n\nIf those (both corporations and individuals) who had previously evaded paying tax now start paying their dues, tax collections would increase.\n\nThis would allow the government to introduce more social help schemes for the poor and needy, and help reduce the income gap problem.\n\nSchemes that help ensure good social mobility would make this country a place of hope for those born to poor families but are willing to work hard to improve their skills and competency to secure a better future for themselves and their families, like the pioneering generation did.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nWITHOUT the concept of Total Defence safeguarding our national security, businesses would not have a safe, sound and secure environment to thrive and prosper.\n\nSingapore's economic growth has been largely due to its reputation as a stable, well-governed country, which has drawn foreign investments and encouraged multinationals to establish their headquarters here.\n\nBusinesses and corporates should continue to ensure that such an environment is maintained and enhanced. Companies should have robust business contingency plans and ensure that their staff are well-briefed, and maybe even trained, to handle emergencies.\n\nIn addition, individuals will need to constantly upgrade their skills and expertise to safeguard the economic defence of our country by remaining competitive.\n\nIn this respect, businesses can contribute towards national defence by providing regular upgrading and training opportunities, which will develop and cultivate talent that will help Singapore stay ahead of the curve.\n\nHo Meng Kit\n\nCEO\n\nSingapore Business Federation\n\nTHE concept of Total Defence continues to be relevant to businesses. It is a call for them to be prepared to ensure that their operational readiness and supply chain are not compromised in the event of a crisis.\n\nIt can be a national emergency or other natural and man-made disruptions. This translates into having business contingency plans to ensure the uninterrupted operations of our offices and factories during these emergencies.\n\nThe Singapore Business Federation (SBF), supported by the National Security Coordination Secretariat, conducts annual dialogue sessions to educate and engage the business community on the importance of preparedness to combat pandemics, cyber threats, natural disasters and other exigencies.\n\nThrough outreach programmes and best practice guides, SBF assists businesses to keep their Business Continuity Management (BCM) programmes relevant.\n\nWe believe that Singapore's continued growth and prosperity lies in the three pillars of our society - government, businesses and the public - working hand in hand to uphold the objectives of Total Defence.\n\nAng Swee Meng, Allen\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nTOTAL Defence is still relevant to enterprise today because security is a critical infrastructure that enables businesses to flourish.\n\nBusinesses can contribute to economic defence by building up a resilient economy and by working with the government to put in place contingency measures to keep offices and factories running during an emergency and NSmen and equipment mobilised.\n\nBusinesses can also support civil and military defence by facilitating employees to go for annual in-camp and other training as required by their units.\n\nIn the final analysis, the concept of Total Defence makes Singapore internationally more competitive as it seeks to avoid political and social uncertainties that plague some countries in the region.\n\nDavid Siah\n\nCountry Manager, Singapore\n\nTrend Micro\n\nONE of the biggest threats to organisations today stems from the fact that many companies are going digital and operating in a dynamic and complex IT environment with various apps and platforms at play.\n\nThese technologies expose networks to great risks, most notably cyber criminals. In situations like these, the concept of Total Defence is relevant to businesses, as every employee plays a part in the cyber security strategy.\n\nAs Singapore becomes a digital nation, we believe it is critical that the country's public and private institutions take heed of the threat posed by cyber criminals.\n\nAs threat defence experts, companies like Trend Micro contribute to cyber defence strategy by helping organisations adapt quickly to evolving user behaviour, technology, infrastructure and threat vectors.\n\nThis, in turn, improves consumers' confidence in the digital economy, one of the critical areas that will drive economic growth over the next few years.\n\nLawrence Koh\n\nFounder and Managing Director\n\niFly Singapore\n\nTOTAL Defence is relevant to businesses here as we seek to build values that would essentially strengthen national pride, build a cooperative workforce and, in turn, ensure economic security in the country.\n\nAs a mentor to my staff, I do my best to manage our work policies that are relevant to upholding the values and virtues of Total Defence.\n\nBy imbuing these values into our working lifestyle, Total Defence becomes an inherent part of our lives, not just another compulsory team-building exercise we have to go through as citizens and colleagues.\n\nBusiness leaders can do their bit by supporting their staff when they are called to serve through government initiatives like Reservist or IPPT, as this builds faith in the stability of our defence system.\n\nBusinesses can also aim to build economic defence by maintaining world-class standards in service and management, and continually upgrading the skills of their staff, but this can still be done without compromising their roles or time in serving the nation, whether as NSmen or as civilians.\n\nAs support from corporations builds confidence in our nation's political and social agenda, the country can better withstand external economic or diplomatic pressures.\n\nBy upholding these values, Total Defence becomes, essentially, good for business.\n\nFrancis Fong\n\nManaging Director\n\nSAS Institute Pte Ltd, Singapore\n\nINTELLIGENCE has always been the cornerstone of any defence strategy, and today more than ever, we see it playing a critical role in driving national security.\n\nThe ''big data'' explosion has provided a goldmine of information that includes news, social media, multimedia (''big data'') with traditional data sources which, when successfully exploited, not only provides a comprehensive picture in real time but can also identify patterns which give warning before events occur.\n\nThis is already possible today, and is an invaluable resource for national security agencies and for the health of the financial and governmental systems.\n\nThe challenge within government and defence agencies is to contextualise the ''big data'' that resides within their organisations.\n\nThis is where companies like SAS come in - to help make sense of the wealth of data available and to turn it into actionable intelligence and insight.\n\nOur high-performance analytics help combat crime and terrorism in three ways - by enabling preventive policing, facilitating information sharing across agencies and borders, and leveraging social media intelligence - all of which are crucial to 21st Century national security.\n\nTom Zack\n\nPresident SEA\n\nEMC Corporation\n\nTHE definition of total defence is not only extremely relevant but also changing rapidly.\n\nWith evolving trends in communication and high reliance on cloud, virtualisation and mobile technologies, communication is getting borderless and so are the attacks.\n\nEvery mobile device opens up an organisation's network to vulnerabilities.\n\nTrends around mobility alongside the blurring lines between business and personal devices highlight the need to ensure that the data residing in an organisation stays safe.\n\nThe growing incidence of cyber-attacks prove that failure to do so can have damaging long term implications on an organisation's success.\n\nA recent EMC survey further highlights that at least 56 per cent of businesses in Asia faced a data breach or data loss in the last 12 months.\n\nAnalysts highlight that the ability to protect and empower employees will be the key differentiator between winners and losers this year.\n\nAuthentication, security, predictive analytics, back-up and recovery tools available today can help arm businesses with the right defence to protect and succeed against the challenges and demands of the digital age.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE concept is certainly still relevant to business organisations as one of the five key components of Total Defence is economic defence.\n\nThere are many examples around the world where economic and political turmoil cause social discord in a country so we need to safeguard against this by ensuring our country's good economic health.\n\nThe business community makes up a large pillar of society and businesses have a significant part to play in keeping the Singapore economy strong.\n\nA solid economic foundation will provide Singapore's citizens with good job opportunities and this will in turn help protect social harmony.\n\nAs citizens, we have a responsibility to seek the welfare of our country, for in Singapore's welfare, we will find our welfare.\n\nOf course, the economic race needs to be properly balanced with the other pillars of Total Defence, namely military, civil, social and psychological.\n\nIf not managed well, the push for economic competitiveness can easily create cracks in a small society like Singapore's.\n\nSo perhaps the concept of Total Defence is even more relevant today as we find ourselves in the transitional phase of economic restructuring.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTOTAL Defence has served Singapore well throughout these years. Businesses can only flourish when the country is stable.\n\nTherefore, Total Defence is definitely still relevant to business.\n\nOne of the ways we, as corporate citizens, can contribute is to ensure that our business operations can continue during crises.\n\nTherefore, we need to have a business continuity plan and staff who can react and implement promptly.\n\nThis means that time and money have to be invested in periodic planning and staff training to make sure that we can cope with any new challenges (floods, riots and so on).\n\nWe have, after all, benefited greatly from Singapore's stability. Hence, we have a duty towards the country, and investing some time and money is the least we can do.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC FairPrice Co-operative Ltd\n\nTOTAL defence is a vital function in ensuring that Singapore continues to thrive in an increasingly volatile global socio-economic climate.\n\nIn a country that imports almost all our food supplies, NTUC FairPrice recognises the important role we play in contributing to our nation's food security and price stability.\n\nThis role becomes more apparent and critical whenever we face a crisis; for example in 2003/2004, FairPrice ensured a steady supply of vegetables, poultry and related products when the Sars outbreak and the bird flu pandemic caused supply shortages to the market.\n\nBeyond ensuring adequate food supply, we also play an active role in moderating and even reducing prices during economic downturns such as during the rice crisis in 2008.\n\nMore recently during the haze crisis last year, we made face masks available widely to combat profiteering from supply shortage and overwhelming demand.\n\nWe are able to protect Singaporeans from volatile price and supply fluctuations because of the strategies we adopt, from source diversification, contract farming and stock piling, to forward buying, direct importing and bulk buying.\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring the affordability and availability of daily essentials for everyone; and in a way, this assurance provides peace of mind to our customers.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nI WAS conscripted into National Service in 1973. I retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1995, after having served 22 years of national service.\n\nI believe I am among the early pioneers, who have an intimate knowledge of National Service and Total Defence, both as a citizen and an employer.\n\nI was a key appointment holder and attended the first Reservists' Officers Staff and Command Course at the Singapore Command and Staff College from 1981 to 1983.\n\nMuch of my leadership skills were honed in National Service, for example, earning respect without having to use authority or, as they say, ''pull rank'' and dealing with complex situations, especially coordinating multi-dimensional needs and challenges.\n\nCompanies which I have worked for have benefited from my training. Based on my experience, Total Defence continues to be relevant and beneficial to business organisations today.\n\nNational Service in Singapore has now been institutionalised. Many parents today want their sons to go through National Service. This has underpinned Total Defence and helped institutionalise it.\n\nMany employers like myself, who have undergone National Service, understand the need for Total Defence. We have accepted this as an integral part of doing business in Singapore.\n\nWhen our employees go for in-camp training and our companies support Total Defence, we are all playing our part to keep Singapore safe round the clock while we conduct our businesses.\n\nI remember this was the message I shared with the Ministry of Defence when I was invited to give inputs on the PR campaign to launch Total Defence 30 years ago, and later as an ambassador to promote Total Defence to businesses, schools and the community, both as a national serviceman and an employer.\n\nWhat matters most in the ultimate test of defending Singapore is the psyche of all Singaporeans.\n\nIn this regard, the holistic approach taken by Total Defence continues to be relevant today. Beyond the recognition and awards for supporting Total Defence, businesses and corporations can and must continue to play a vital role to strengthen this psyche, by giving Total Defence the requisite priority and support it needs, on an on-going basis.\n\nWe do not want to be put to the test. Much is at stake for businesses. Total Defence ensures that this will not happen.\n\nMark Billington\n\nRegional Director, South-east Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nTHE holistic nature of Total Defence, adapted from similar Danish and Swiss philosophies, remains as important today as it did 30 years ago.\n\nSingapore's small size and global nature mean that we remain highly sensitive to external shocks and international economic trends, and building resilience into the system will help businesses shelter against difficult times.\n\nEconomic defence also includes maintaining our environmental resources so that they can support future generations in growth.\n\nWith limited natural resources, we are reliant on the little we have and those around us.\n\nThis is why ICAEW has championed accounting for natural capital as an essential part of business reporting.\n\nNatural resources are a critical asset and it is becoming increasingly necessary for businesses and investors to factor natural capital into their strategies and decisions if their behaviour is to become more sustainable.\n\nIt is not just the obvious industries such as mining, forestry and agriculture which are affected.\n\nMost supply chains start with a natural resource or use air, water and rely on unpolluted soil.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice President, Asia South Region\n\nSymantec\n\nAS Singapore commemorates three decades of Total Defence this year, it's noteworthy that the five pillars of Total Defence continue to remain relevant despite the changing security landscape.\n\nThey are also now intertwined and supported by the digital economy, and as we increasingly live and conduct our lives online, we need to ensure that online security is not taken for granted.\n\nAs recent events remind us, cyber attacks have the ability to seriously disrupt and affect a country and her citizen's everyday lives, emphasising the need for us to be mindful of new threats and dangers that can undermine the security of businesses and corporations.\n\nBy keeping IT policies and security software up-to-date and adopting best practices to protect critical data, we can work towards making every day a Safer Internet Day, minimising the risk of cyber attacks while doing our part for Total Defence.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nTOTAL Defence - to every Singaporean and organisation - is an immutable obligation. It is ingrained into the psyche of every Singaporean that national defence is about protecting and preserving our independence and freedom as a country.\n\nIt is not a question of relevancy but how each individual, organisation, business and corporate plays its role in Total Defence. This means being supportive of employees serving time in reservist training and celebrating with staff who excel in their service stints.\n\nThe Total Defence mentality must go beyond paying lip service; it must be an entrenched belief and conviction that it is only through Total Defence that Singapore could become what it is today, and how we can preserve our way of life, our cultures, our businesses and, most importantly, our national vitality.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nTHE concept of Total Defence will stay relevant not only to business organisations but to the entire population for many years to come. Every individual and member of the business and civil sector has a role to play to make our Total Defence capability work for the nation. This is more so for us as a small nation. Possible threats not only in the form of military attacks but other non-military adversities like exploitation of any economic, social or psychological weaknesses can happen anytime.\n\nAs a member of the business sector, employers can continue to support Total Defence by ensuring that its operationally-ready NSmen are released for required courses and exercises when mobilised. Systems should be in place for covering arrangements to ensure business operations can continue smoothly without disruption when such situations arise.\n\nIt should be an accepted work attitude among employees and employers should set the lead in setting good examples in supporting Total Defence for the country. Business associations can include Total Defence education on an ongoing basis among businesses to increase awareness among employers.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nTODAY'S youth might believe that the world mentality was different two generations ago, and that wars, espionage, civil unrest and racial hatred are things of the past. We must therefore actively encourage learning and understanding of the five pillars of Total Defence. The pillars that are not so obvious need reaffirming - society, the economy and psychology of the nation are easily undermined, no thanks to the Internet.\n\nSingapore's history must be taught and celebrated in the centres of education and the workplace, with parallels drawn to what else was going on in the world at the same time. This might make our youth far more patriotic and aware of the threats that our neighbours present to our national security. While our military and civil defences are very capable in defending us, it is far better to have a fence at the top of the cliff than an ambulance at the bottom.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE is economically well placed on the global map despite her size and scarcity of natural resources. One key driver behind Singapore's rise to its present status is confidence in the city-state, not just from internal but also offshore stakeholders. Confidence is key in attracting and acquiring funds and investors to keep the economy thriving. Total Defence is instrumental in instilling confidence.\n\nI see civil defence as the main component where businesses could actively play a part. By pledging resources such as logistics supply and skilled workforce in trying times, we pool together a troop to battle situations with prompt readiness. Mindset is mastermind to success and it is important for businesses to stay positive and keep operations in continuity to enhance psychological defence. The concept of Total Defence certainly holds great relevance to the business environment today, as we continue to attract investments to the island.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nTHIRTY years of Total Defence has led to it being even more relevant today. Aside from the combined elements of Total Defence, economic defence requires government, businesses and industries to organise and galvanise resources in a precise way.\n\nThe economy must continue to function even in the face of impending calamity. Strategic resource planning requires offices and factories to be able to continue operations even in a crisis with manpower or equipment shortages. The very act of planning - which should be a prerequisite for every organisation in Singapore - means that businesses are able to forward plan and develop contingencies in the use of resources in meeting different needs in times of strife.\n\nThis in turn enables business organisations to develop deeper and more progressive overarching thinking on all aspects of business, not simply fiscal considerations. It develops and upgrades skills, critical thinking, and potentially helps form business strategies beneficial overall, including cost efficiency. It puts us ahead of the curve. Just as Sun Tzu is deemed effective in the business world, no less should Total Defence be.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company also continued to see strong uptake in cloud subscription revenues.\n\nShe added that the whole region saw double-digit growth in SSRS for full-year fiscal 2013. The financial services industry (such as banking and insurance) and public sector have been the fastest-growing sectors for the region, she added.\n\n\"Within Asia-Pacific, South-east Asia performed very well in fiscal 2013, particularly during the second half of the year, recording strong, double-digit growth,\" Ms Fox-Martin said. \"(Overall) this momentum bodes well for the current year as large enterprises in APJ continue to choose SAP over the competition.\"\n\nShe said that Singapore also registered healthy software and SSRS growth during the year.\n\nMs Fox-Martin said that companies in Asia face competition, demanding customers and regional and international expansion needs. \"As a result, they are required to adopt and consume IT in a much faster and easier way. That's the way SAP is providing solutions to customers in the SAP cloud or on premise powered by our in-memory technology SAP Hana. We're making SAP the cloud company powered by SAP Hana for customers in Asia.\"\n\nShe said that data, devices and the people who use them are more connected than ever. There is immense value to be unlocked by connecting this information, the so-called \"dark data\", to the work people do every day, enabling users to quickly discover what is happening and then act with the power of collective insight, she added.\n\nMs Fox-Martin said that more companies today are seeing the opportunities created by the power of data and are aiming to find ways to harness the power of this data to make better business decisions in real-time and provide a better experience to customers.\n\n\"SAP's analytics vision is built around driving a near real-time connected experience across enterprise business intelligence (BI), agile visualisation and advanced analytics,\" she said.\n\n\"Analytic solutions from SAP help facilitate this discovery by connecting users, data, platforms and devices, allowing people to quickly and easily engage with their data, visualise what is happening and predict what comes next,\" Ms Fox-Martin added.\n\nMobile is no longer an option, it's everything, she observed. \"Today, more technology vendors are recognising that the strength of this app-based economy lies in the enterprise. Once considered the sweet spot for Angry Birds, mobile developers have shifted focus to creating enterprise-grade mobile applications covering every possible mobile platform; and in 2014, we'll see that development continue to increase as developers take advantage of newly introduced, streamlined tools that help create and deploy the same mobile application across multiple platforms.\"\n\nShe said that SAP is \"well positioned as a leader\" in the cloud, though adoption in developed markets is different from adoption in developing markets. \"All SAP's line-of-business applications (Human Resources, Procurement, Customer Relationship Management and others) are clearly moving to cloud and we are driving a cloud-first approach,\" Ms Fox-Martin said.\n\nA triple-digit percentage growth in its Asia-Pacific cloud business during the fourth quarter marked the third time this happened in fiscal 2013. \"The company's cloud business growth demonstrates SAP's successful transition to the cloud while managing the growth of its core business. We now have a cloud revenue run rate of more than one billion euros and we have the largest subscriber base with 35 million cloud users.\n\n\"In Asia-Pacific, we see the fast shift in markets like ANZ (Australia and New Zealand). Other markets like India and SEA also saw accelerated adoption rate of cloud.\"\n\nMs Fox-Martin pointed out that the days of building a business case to move to the cloud based on total cost of ownership (TCO) are over. \"Companies will increasingly look to invest in the cloud as their innovation platform - as a way in which they can extend their existing infrastructure, enable new processes and achieve new insights that enable them to run their business in an entirely new way - not just do the same old thing using a different delivery model.\"\n\namit@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Yellen made no bones about her intention to continue \"tapering\" bond purchases. So while that's bad news, at least one uncertainty is removed - traders do not have to worry if quantitative easing is going to carry on, or not.\n\nIn testimony before the House of Representatives and the Senate last week, the Fed chief made crystal clear that she will pick up the baton from Ben Bernanke and keep up with the move to wind down the bond purchases.\n\nShe reassured markets that the Fed in her care will not be easily swayed by weak jobs reports. Admitting that she had not anticipated the surprisingly poor jobs growth in January and February, Ms Yellen warned against jumping to conclusions on the overall trend of jobs growth based on only two reports.\n\nSpeaking at an event on Tuesday in Dallas, Fed regional president Richard Fisher said Ms Yellen had done a \"great job\". Mr Fisher said he and Ms Yellen had had differences of opinion in the past, but that she now spoke for him and the rest of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\"Her job is no longer to express her views, but to lead us as Ben Bernanke led us,\" Mr Fisher said.\n\nMs Yellen was also unfazed by the emerging markets crisis, echoing statements from Mr Fisher and others who have said the current scare is unlikely to lead to a repeat of the currency crises in the developing world in the 1990s.\n\n\"The big risk out there is if you really see a slowdown in the economy due to turmoil in international markets, or some major credit crisis that would constrain liquidity out there,\" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at mutual fund firm Hodges Capital. \"I don't think that's likely; otherwise the Fed wouldn't be curtailing the QE programme.\"\n\nMajor indexes were also lifted by earnings reports that were by and large positive last week. Industrial companies such as farming machinery giant Deere & Co and building materials maker Owens Corning exceeded Wall Street growth targets.\n\nThis suggests that two vital parts of the economy - farming and construction - are shaping up for a big sprint.\n\n\"In general, you're seeing construction markets pick back up,\" said Mr Marshall of Hodges Capital. \"If you look at companies that sell building wire, that sell cement, that sell gypsum or wall board - they're taking price increases here in January, February, March . . . right before construction season.\"\n\nAnother sign of construction activity and the jobs market picking up in the spring was the statement from home improvement chain Home Depot, which said the company will hire 80,000 workers ahead of its busiest season.\n\nA substantial majority - nearly 400 - of the Standard & Poor's 500 which have reported first-quarter earnings have surpassed the average analyst's estimate.\n\nThere were a few major disappointments in this buoyant earnings season, however. WellCare Health Plans, an administrator of health insurance to the poor and the elderly, indicated fees linked to the new healthcare legislation had eaten into its profits.\n\nMr Fisher, of the Dallas Fed, reiterated his argument that the regulations passed by US Congress have done more to harm than to help the economic recovery in the last several years. Mr Fisher said his major worry as a central banker was not inflation but stagnated growth in middle-income jobs, something he believes is a direct result of fiscal policy.\n\nTraders have also looked past some weak economic reports recently, working under the assumption that the stronger reports in November and early December were more accurate reflections of economic activity.\n\nA historically bad winter brought more blizzards to the south and eastern seaboard of the US last week. On Saturday, city workers had just finished clearing roughly one foot of snow off the streets of New York City when it began to snow again.\n\nThe jobs report two weeks ago and the retail sales report last week, which showed an unexpected dip in January sales, both partly blamed the poor weather for their underperformance.\n\n\"I think investors should prepare themselves for slightly negative news or small misses in terms of economic data as a result of all the bad weather the country's experienced,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\n\"But that's going to be very temporary. I would expect a jump in jobless claim, perhaps even a slight uptick in unemployment numbers in February,\" he added.\n\nSuch a blip should not be misinterpreted as a change in course, Mr Pursche said. He has little doubt that the recovery is picking up.\n\n\"You saw it in a rise in small business optimism; you see it in inventory-to-sales ratios . . . Just about every leading indicator is pointing to continued strength,\" Mr Pursche said.\n\nFor now, it seems likely that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will test the record set in January and settle around 16,600 points, or perhaps even hit 17,000.\n\nBut should the economy fail to bloom in spring, the recent optimism could melt away with the snow.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Maybe not for long.\n\nBy devoting his latest blog specifically on the subject, Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Clearings and Exchange, has put a spotlight on a controversial subject by revealing that \"I think it is timely for a renewed debate on circuit breakers to determine if they are now needed in the Hong Kong market\".\n\nAt least twice before, in early 1997 and 2004, HKEx dropped the idea after being met with lukewarm response from market participants. In his blog published on Thursday evening, Mr Li said this time, it's different. \"Our market has discussed circuit breakers from time to time before, with the conclusion being that they weren't necessary. Some people say that circuit breakers are not suitable for our market and amount to market intervention, therefore, are a waste of time to consider. But I don't think that previous decisions necessarily apply to evolving market conditions today.\"\n\nHe confirmed earlier reports that the exchange is weighing the merits of introducing circuit breakers. \"I think it is timely for a renewed debate on circuit breakers to determine if they are now needed in the Hong Kong market. So that's why we're looking at circuit breakers again.\"\n\nHis confirmation has political backing from the industry regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, whose executive director Keith Lui publicly lent his support to an adoption of circuit breakers, saying it would bring Hong Kong in line with international practice.\n\nWhen asked about a possible timetable for introducing circuit breakers for Hong Kong's exchange-traded products, a HKEx spokesman said: \"We continue to monitor developments in the global markets and consider if any measures can further improve the efficiency and integrity of our market. We keep an eye on a wide range of issues and there have been no conclusions or timetables with respect to circuit breakers.\"\n\nAmong the opponents for adopting circuit breakers is Jeffrey Chan, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association and founding partner of Oriental Patron Financial Group, who reportedly declared that Hong Kong's current trading system does not support any plans for a circuit breaker system and that any proposal will be subject to public consultation.\n\nOthers argued that HKEx's existing power to suspend trading of a stock, sometimes halting it for days or even weeks, is sufficient to prevent the market from suffering flash crash.\n\nOn the need for renewed debate, Mr Li cited the recent development in electronic trading, now often done automatically via algorithms \"that have a chance, even if a remote chance, of generating erroneous orders which could create an overreaction and threaten market integrity\". The consequence could be \"considerable turmoil which could impact confidence in the market\", he noted.\n\nHe explained that carrying out a review of circuit breakers is a response to request from the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, and in line with new electronic trading regulations to be implemented by Hong Kong early this year.\n\nHe also took the opportunity to debunk three misconceptions about HKEx's motive and about what model of circuit breakers would be suited to Hong Kong.\n\nFirst, he dismissed criticism about HKEx being motivated by its wish to speed up connectivity in its market structure and infrastructure with that of China mainland where a circuit breaker mechanism has long been enforced. \"Aligning with the mainland is not the objective. The objective is first to consider whether there is a need for circuit breakers in Hong Kong,\" he said. He added that building connectivity with the mainland is a strategic but long term goal, not something to be achieved overnight.\n\nSecond, it is about finding a model of circuit breakers that best suits Hong Kong. He explained that circuit breakers do not only mean strict daily price limits, as it is on the mainland or in other Asian markets. They could be designed \"with thresholds that are not fixed but adjust dynamically with market movements, allowing price discovery to take place more normally\".\n\nThe third is about not drawing up a direct correlation between circuit breakers and trading suspensions. Mr Li said some circuit breaker models, currently in use by some exchanges, could be done to provide a short \"cooling off\", usually lasting for a few minutes, while trading continues under certain limitations such as on the price at which orders may be executed.\n\n\"Where we decide to proceed with new initiatives, we will consult the market comprehensively; if the initiative is supported by the market, we'll implement it in an appropriate manner,\" Mr Li concluded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Vale has said it was losing US$2 to US$3 per tonne in iron ore shipping costs because of the Chinese ban.\n\nDue to the ban, the miner set up a transshipment terminal in the Philippines in February 2012 where the Valemaxes can transfer iron ore into smaller ships bound for China. It is also building an iron ore storage and distribution hub in Malaysia, expected to start operations this year.\n\nThe ships have also been docking at other ports, including in Italy, Japan, Oman and South Korea, said Mr Krishna.\n\nIn August, the transport ministry said in a draft document published on its website that ports may be allowed to receive ships based on the inherent capacity of their infrastructure, pending regulatory approvals. The ministry then sought feedback from the local marine industry.\n\nThree months later, Xinhua news agency reported that China's state-owned Shandong Shipping Corp signed a US$500 million deal with Vale to operate four of the Valemaxes.\n\nChina barred the Valemaxes from its ports about a month after the first of the giant vessels docked at Dalian port in December 2011. But a Valemax managed to dock at China's Lianyungang port in April last year.\n\nBesides Dalian and Lianyungang, other ports that may be able to accept Valemax vessels include Dongjiakou and Caofeidian, as well as Zhanjiang and Ningbo Zhoushan, which are under construction, industry sources said.\n\nMost of the ships were built in Chinese shipyards and partly financed by the country's international development bank. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

No price guide was given for the property in Kirribilli, a suburb four kilometres north of the city centre, where the median house price was A$2.35 million (S$2.68 million), according to the website.\n\nThe RBA is putting the house up for sale after its record-low 2.5 per cent benchmark interest rate helped drive a 13.4 per cent gain in Sydney dwelling prices in the 12 months to Jan 31. While home prices are at a record, the country's jobless rate is at a decade-high 6 per cent, shrinking the likelihood of a rate increase that could arrest further price surges.\n\n\"It's a seller's market quite clearly: there are plenty of buyers out there, not many listings, and prices are rising, so it's not a bad time to sell,\" said Louis Christopher, managing director of Sydney-based real estate data provider SQM Research. \"It's a little bit perplexing as to why the RBA was holding residential property.\"\n\nRachael Wright, marketing agent at Ray White, declined to comment on the listing, which shows the house, at 10 Carabella Street, has been split into two apartments. Colleague Kingsley Yates didn't immediately respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment. The RBA declined to comment on the sale. State government filings show the RBA owns both apartments.\n\nKirribilli, which is also the location of Sydney residences of the prime minister and the governor general, is surrounded by water on three sides, with views of the city's Opera House and Harbour Bridge.\n\nThe RBA bought 8 and 10 Carabella Street in 1986, and combined them with a neighbouring property that it already owned as part of a new staff training college, according to a city council document. The bank's HC Coombs Centre for Financial Studies is still located at the adjoining property at 122A Kirribilli Avenue, according to its website.\n\nThe value of the RBA's property, plant and equipment assets was A$491 million as of June 30, up from A$448 million a year earlier, the bank's financial statements for the 2013 fiscal year show.\n\nThe tenants of one of the apartments at Eversley gave notice of their plans to vacate in mid-2013, according to documents released in December under a Freedom of Information request. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/6a685d550330267ee0c13a20e9d8d832fb94312c60be3d5c8de36dc990c3f28c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Price booster: The RBA's record-low 2.5% benchmark interest rate helped drive a 13.4% gain in Sydney home prices in the 12 months to Jan 31. -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/smart-way-property-investment", "site_title": "A smart way to property investment", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA smart way to property investment\n\nReits, with their high liquidity and lower capital requirement, are a good option, especially for a beginner, says CAI HAOXIANG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 16, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPROPERTY investing has always been popular in Asia and especially in land-scarce Singapore. The common conception of how one can invest in property is often limited to buying a Housing Board (HDB) resale flat or a private condominium.\n\nFor the beginner investor with limited capital, a condo unit might not be the best type of investment to start out with. The downpayment for a suburban condo is likely to be at least $150,000. One takes on substantial debt of up to 80 per cent of the value of the property. The private property market, too, is showing signs of a market top. Rental yields have fallen while prices have risen.\n\nThe government's cooling measures also mean that most young people will only own one investment property for some time. This makes diversification difficult, but putting all of your eggs in one basket is risky.\n\nBy contrast, the publicly traded equity market offers more options. Property development companies, which buy land, build units and sell them off, are one way to get exposed.\n\nA relatively recent innovation in Singapore is the real estate investment trust (Reit). Investors can buy small ownership chunks of portfolios of shopping malls, office buildings or industrial factories and warehouses. For example, one lot of CapitaMall Trust (CMT), the oldest Reit and biggest in Singapore, goes for about $1,800.\n\nThe publicly traded Reit market has suffered considerably since last May. Prices for Singapore Reits have corrected by around 20 per cent since fears of rising interest rates left financial markets shaken. Reit prices may very well correct further, depending on how high interest rates go.\n\nThis article will touch on why people buy property and outline the characteristics of the investment class. It will also discuss how buying a residential unit differs from buying a Reit. A future piece will elaborate on Reits specifically, and how to value them.\n\nWhy buy property?\n\nThe reasons why people buy property in general also apply to Reits. There are four main reasons to buy any sort of property: diversification, capital appreciation, rental income and as a hedge against inflation.\n\nProperty prices do not move up and down together with other asset classes such as stocks or bonds. This means that if you hold property together with stocks, for example, the overall fluctuations of your portfolio are reduced. You can sleep soundly at night knowing that your net worth is unlikely to change much on a daily basis, compared to the return you can get.\n\nCapital appreciation comes about because Singapore is a relatively land-scarce country. If demand for land outstrips supply, prices are likely to rise. In the last 10 years, average property prices have doubled. This works out to an average yield of more than 7 per cent a year.\n\nRetirees also like to hold property because of the rental income they provide. HDB flats and condos can be leased out to tenants on a long-term basis of six months or more. The Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) guidelines also state that the maximum number of occupants in a residential unit is eight, no matter how big the unit is, and each occupant should have at least 10 square metres of space.\n\nFinally, property is regarded as a way to protect against inflation, or rising prices. When prices in an economy go up, rents and property values might also go up.\n\nResidential properties versus Reits\n\nSimilarly, the value of a Reit's properties has the potential to appreciate. The Reit can then choose to sell the property and buy another one with a greater potential for growth.\n\nThe rental income a Reit collects and distributes to unitholders can also increase over time. Here, a key statistic to look out for is a Reit's occupancy rate. If you have a condo with three bedrooms, you want to make sure that all three rooms are rented out. Similarly, because Reits own large properties such as shopping malls or office buildings, they have to maximise their rental income.\n\nBecause of the potential for both capital appreciation and a steady stream of rental income, properties and Reits in particular are said to take on the characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Reits have high liquidity as they are divided into many tiny units which are traded like stocks. They also have bond-like characteristics because of rental payments from tenants. Just as a bond promises its holder a fixed sum of income twice a year for say five to 10 years, tenants pay rentals every month, and sign long-term leases to do so. One way to value a Reit is therefore to calculate, in today's terms, a stream of projected rental payments going into the future.\n\nThe risk of a Reit is also somewhere between that of a stock and a bond. Bonds are thought of as low-risk, low-return investments, while stocks offer higher risk for higher returns. Because they take on the characteristics of both, Reit prices should theoretically not fluctuate as much as stocks and offer investors a decent yield. This might make them good diversifiers to a portfolio.\n\nBoth Reits and residential property have similar features which potential investors would do well to take note of.\n\nOne characteristic relates to the use of debt. Property buyers generally take out loans to finance their purchases. If they can borrow at a lower interest rate than the yield they generate on their property, they will make money. Interest rate increases eat into their profits if they have to refinance their loans at higher rates.\n\nThe higher one's borrowings and the more one pays in monthly mortgages relative to one's income, the riskier the investment is. If you cannot service the property mortgage payments for whatever reason, the bank that lent you the money will have the right to claim the property and sell it off, because the property was used as collateral for the mortgage. This legal process is known as foreclosure.\n\nProperty prices are affected by the general economy. If an economy slows down or goes into recession, leading to retrenchments, some people will not be able to service their monthly mortgage payments. They might then be forced to sell their properties at a discount to repay a portion of their loan to the bank. This is known as a distressed sale. If there are many distressed sellers in the market, property prices are likely to fall. Even those holding on to properties which they have already paid off will see the values of their homes plunge.\n\nCredit rating\n\nSimilarly, Reits borrow from banks or private investors to finance their purchases. They can also go to equity holders, but the cost of doing so is typically higher. Reits can borrow up to 35 per cent of the value of their property, and go up to 60 per cent if they obtain and disclose a credit rating from Fitch, Moody's or Standard and Poor's.\n\nReits typically borrow through short-term loans of a few years, and roll over their debt after the loan period is up by getting a similar loan at the prevalent market rate. In the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, financial markets feared that an economic downturn would cause tenants to go out of business and default on their rental payments. If that happened, Reits would face lower income streams and would not be able to refinance their debts. Many Reits were thus trading at extremely low valuations as investors wondered if they would go bankrupt.\n\nAn investor should therefore scrutinise the debt levels of a Reit and ask if they are sustainable. Some Reits are better placed to weather market downturns than others. In a sustained economic downturn, people might still need to shop for necessities, so shopping mall Reits might still perform well. But an office Reit might not if enough businesses decide to close shop or move somewhere cheaper.\n\nIlliquid property\n\nAnother major characteristic of property is that it tends to be illiquid. This means that property cannot be easily disposed of. This illiquidity is due to the complexity of most property transactions, as well as the large values involved. To sell a unit without making a loss, one has to find a buyer who can pay more than what one bought it for. This is a process that can take weeks or months. In a weak market, like now, it might be difficult for an average property to fetch a good price. Even if you lower the selling price of your condo, for example, it takes time for the buyer to evaluate whether the price is worth paying, relative to other options he or she has.\n\nBy comparison, Reits and stocks of large corporations can easily be sold on the public market at any point of the economic cycle, with brokers and traders standing ready to take a position. If one desperately needs the cash, one would find it easier to liquidate a Reit investment than a property. The underlying property might still be illiquid, but the Reit itself is not.\n\nA final characteristic of property investments is the management and maintenance costs which are required. If you own a condo for investment, you have to spend time and money advertising or sourcing for tenants, negotiating rental contracts, collecting rental payments and fixing property defects. If the property you own is old, you might need to spend money to renovate it so it will be more attractive to tenants.\n\nOn the other hand, a Reit employs an agent to help it manage the property. This is advantageous in a way. You do not have to worry about ceiling leaks or ageing facilities at a mall or office property when you buy units in a Reit. A professional manager will do it for you. Of course, the fees they charge have to be reasonable and free of conflicts of interest. Fee structures are disclosed in the Reits's annual report. We will discuss this in a future article.\n\nThe best managers will be able to add value to their properties through asset enhancement initiatives, or AEI for short. They can, for example, improve the layout of a mall to increase shopper flow. They can change the tenant mix, taking out unprofitable shops. Profitable tenants mean that Reits have the leeway to increase rentals, for example. Mall managers can also subdivide their space more efficiently to maximise rentals - witness how common spaces in malls are being used for promotional events now.\n\nIn short, property investments are usually classified as alternative investments, as opposed to the traditional classes of stocks and bonds. They can take on the characteristics of a growth stock during certain times, and offer the steady income streams of a bond in others. Those who cannot afford a condo but still want an instrument that gives a stream of income can think about getting a Reit first.\n\nhaoxiang@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In particular, improving trade finance processes to close any money-laundering loopholes would enhance the Republic's reputation as the financial hub of Asia-Pacific.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Hugh Jones, CEO of Accuity, illustrated the current challenges banks and other financial institutions face in ensuring compliance for cross-border trade finance transactions. Accuity is a data solutions provider with a stable of 17,000 corporate clients, of which 60 per cent are banks and another 20 per cent are non-bank financial institutions such as insurance firms. It is part of the Reed Elsevier family of companies, having been acquired in 2011.\n\nCompanies are still reliant on paper-based processes when it comes to trade finance - and this hinders their efforts to monitor and detect potential money-laundering activities, Mr Jones noted. It is easy, for instance, to overlook a transaction when a company shipping hammers worth, say, US$5 each receives an invoice stating the price of each hammer as US$1,000 when records are all stored in paper form and automated analysis to flag a suspicious transaction is not available, he explained.\n\nCiting findings from a white paper by Swift/Fung Institute, he noted how traditional trade finance is costly and inefficient. In Asia-Pacific alone, the annual cost of processing paper- based trade documents was US$138 billion in 2010, Mr Jones added.\n\nSuch money-laundering practices affect popular port cities like Singapore, in particular, given that it was the port of call for 139,417 vessels in 2013, according to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.\n\nTracking, monitoring and reporting all cross-border trade and its financing to ensure compliance on such a scale is a \"trillion-dollar opportunity\", and Accuity is at the forefront of providing tools such as Compliance Link to companies to do so, Mr Jones said.\n\nTrade between China and Hong Kong alone accounted for US$155 billion of laundered money from 2012 to the first quarter of 2013, he added.\n\nA separate report released last December by Global Financial Integrity, a Washington, DC-based research organisation, revealed Asia-Pacific accounted for three of the top five countries with the highest measured cumulative illicit financial outflows between 2002 and 2011. China topped the list with US$1.08 trillion, while Malaysia in fourth spot contributed US$370.38 billion and fifth-placed India accounted for US$343.93 billion, it stated.\n\nMr Jones pointed out that improving communication between the trade finance department and the bank's compliance unit would also go a long way in helping close the money-laundering gap in this area.\n\nHe said the compliance team already has processes in place to run transactions through the gamut of regulatory requirements, but they need to sieve through the various transactional details logged in by the trade finance team and this is a time-intensive exercise with room for oversight.\n\nHe said banks and other financial organisations don't have to commit heavy investments to overhaul existing IT systems to implement more sophisticated monitoring tools to combat money laundering.\n\n\"Banks already have the data; it's just in paper form. If they could leverage existing transaction databases, all they need to do is build in new workflows and processes to detect and act against suspicious transactions,\" he said, adding that this needed the cooperation between the trade finance and compliance teams who have to sit down and work on the required processes.\n\nHenry Balani, MD at Accuity, added that it is a matter of emphasis by banks in Singapore to tackle trade-based money-laundering activities with technology. Instead of using big data innovations solely to gain insights on customers' spending behaviour, the same technology can be used to offer intelligence around suspicious transactions, he said.\n\nThe challenges to combating money-laundering activities by banks here were reiterated in the inaugural National Risk Assessment (NRA) report released by the Ministry of Home Affairs last month.\n\nThe report noted, for example, how full banks and qualifying full banks (QFBs) are exposed to the highest level of risk to money-laundering activities across the entire financial sector.\n\n\"These banks generally have a significant global presence and engage in activities such as trade finance, cash management services and correspondent banking. Transactions could include cross-border transactions with jurisdictions of higher money-laundering risks, where the banks have to put in place additional risk mitigation measures,\" it stated.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Fewer than three in ten companies now expect a deterioration in business conditions over the next six months. The business prospects net balance - the difference between the proportion of sanguine and pessimistic responses - thus jumped 15 percentage points to 4 per cent.\n\nThis first positive showing in more than 30 months brings the BT-UniSIM survey report broadly in line with what the latest official business expectations surveys of manufacturing and services firms say.\n\nFor services firms, the outlook for January to June 2014 remains positive, even though the net weighted balance of one per cent fell from the 8 per cent reported the previous quarter.\n\nAnd a net weighted balance of 4 per cent of manufacturers polled by the Economic Development Board (EDB) say things are looking up in the next six months - an improvement from the previous quarter's one per cent reading.\n\nBusiness expectations aside, the three other indicators tracked by the BT-UniSIM survey - sales, profits and new orders - continued to point to contraction in Q4, but a smaller one.\n\n\"The stronger net balances in Q4 2013, and the turnaround in business prospects to optimistic sentiment, suggest that Q4 2013 could well be the end of the current contraction phase (as measured by the poll),\" said survey director Chow Kit Boey.\n\nHowever, she noted that respondents have not turned as bullish as they were in Q4 2009, which was when the last contraction phase ended. Then, the business prospects net balance was a resoundingly confident 45 per cent.\n\n\"Optimism on business prospects is more subdued . . . This is probably due mainly to weaker growth in China and Singapore's steeper increases in business cost,\" said Ms Chow.\n\nEven so, the turnaround in business sentiment bodes well for the wider economy. The report's various net balances, which bear a close correlation to year-on-year GDP growth in the following quarter, now predict that the Singapore economy will grow 5.4-5.9 per cent in Q1 2014.\n\nThat prediction is based on the official flash estimate of 4.4 per cent GDP growth in the final quarter of 2014.\n\nEconomists polled by Bloomberg say that the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) may revise this upwards, to 4.9 per cent, when it releases final growth figures on Thursday. This looks likely, after a surprising surge in December's industrial production.\n\nThe economists are projecting even stronger Q1 growth than the survey does, too: the median of seven banks' forecasts was 6.2 per cent.\n\nOf the five broad sectors poll respondents fall into, those in the business of transport & communications had the best showing this round, with the strongest expansion in Q4 sales and profits, as well as the brightest business prospects for the six months ahead.\n\nManufacturing came in second best, topping the charts for new orders or business in Q4. More small and foreign manufacturers have also seen improvements in sales and profits.\n\nEconomists think manufacturing growth will continue to pick up. \"Cyclically, we think the strengthening US economy will have positive spillovers to Singapore's manufacturing sector - in particular, the electronics industry,\" said Barclays economist Joey Chew.\n\nHowever, she and others have noted that the US rebound's impact on the local economy may be crimped by Singapore's ongoing economic restructuring efforts.\n\nChallenges that local enterprises face as a result of restructuring include \"a decline in cost-competitiveness, the hollowing out of some production capacity, and increasingly binding resource constraints\", including the tighter supply of labour, Ms Chew said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore is intended as its Asia-Pacific headquarters, London will represent Europe and Silicon Valley for the Americas.\n\nThe facilities are funded by the company's R&D (research and development) efforts, and are intended to complement its research department by partnering industry players and tertiary institutions. The company couldn't specify how much of its revenue or R&D budget will go to the centres.\n\nKonica Minolta's R&D offices in Japan and the US focus on technology research areas such as imaging, optics, materials and nano-fabrication, but the business innovation centres signal the company's new push into enterprise services.\n\nThe company is in the midst of a pivotal shift in the printing industry. Since the turn of the century, Japanese companies such as Konica Minolta, Fuji Xerox and Canon have wrested the multi-billion dollar printing market from US companies like Olivetti and Compuprint.\n\nToday, Japan's vendors still play a huge part in the printing market, but increasing pressure from vendors outside continue to mount. Korean giant Samsung, for example, has released mobile printing apps that sync with its smartphones, allowing it to use its smartphone portfolio to make a bigger impact on the market.\n\nKonica Minolta understands this pressure and is making a concerted effort away from the consumer market and deeper into the enterprise space.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the facility, Masatoshi Matsuzaki, president and CEO of Konica Minolta, said that the five locations were chosen because they are intended to help the company get closer to enterprise clients in each geography. \"We need to customise the (services) we come up with to fit each region's demands as closely as possible,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that 65 per cent of the company's printer sales in the US were driven by the IT services that it has been able to offer together with its printing hardware. For its next boost, the company intends to push harder into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn a late-2013 interview, Jun Haraguchi, senior executive officer at Konica Minolta, said that the company is keen to grow the revenue contribution from Asia outside Japan from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in the next five years. Mr Haraguchi said that western countries are growing at a far smaller rate compared with Asia, driven by emerging markets in the latter region.\n\nGlobally, 72 per cent of Konica Minolta's US$10 billion revenue in 2012 came from its business technologies services, while 18 per cent came from industry business. Healthcare is one of the biggest standalone verticals, at 9 per cent contribution to its revenue, according to Mr Matsuzaki.\n\n\"We are trying to shift from being a hardware player to a services provider. We hope the business innovation centres will accelerate this,\" the CEO noted.\n\nHe said that Singapore was chosen as the Asia-Pacific centre because the company has ties with research institutions such as A*Star's (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) I2R (Institute of Infocomm Research) arm. It plans to extend its industry collaboration to start-ups and independent software vendors in the country, as well.\n\nYuji Ichimura, Konica Minolta's head of the IT service business, said that each centre will be rolled out with a staff of about 10, noting that Singapore has eight people now. The heads of the innovation centres for Silicon Valley and London have already been hired, and former NCS executive Rachel Goh will helm the Singapore facility.\n\nSingapore will begin its research efforts with cloud-based service offerings, with the goal of developing more printing and document management services based on connected devices. The company explained that some of its enterprise clients have been pressing for cloud-based printing but need the vendor offerings to be based on tighter security restrictions. For example, companies may want to connect its mobile devices to office printer, but need to cordon the printers off within a private network in order to reduce the likelihood of third parties sniffing private documents, said David Kwok, principal architect at Konica Minolta.\n\nOne of Konica Minolta's clients, Kyoto University Hospital, recently implemented a setup like this. It had a set of printers on an Intranet network, but wanted them to connect with staff laptops which are connected to the public Internet. It eventually chose a private printing network tying the laptops and printers together, but allowed laptops to stay connected to the public network, so that staff would not have their Internet services restricted, said Mr Kwok.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Five companies posted 18 purchases worth $2.86 million, against one with five disposals worth $0.49 million. The figures were sharply down from the previous week's 14 companies, 36 purchases, and $6.85 million and two firms, 14 disposals, and $1.83 million. This was likely due to the busy reporting season as directors are prohibited from trading in their companies' shares one month prior to the announcement of results.\n\nTrading by others last week saw five companies recording seven repurchases worth $1.13 million. The figures, however, were sharply up from the previous week's two firms, two trades, and $0.697 million.\n\nDespite the low activity, there were several significant corporate shareholder purchases last week with buybacks in Keppel Land, Bionsensors International, and Cordlife Group and a rare insider buy in Suntec Reit. On the institutional front, there were rare fund manager sales in Dukang Distillers, Raffles Medical Group, and Keppel Corporation.\n\nKeppel Land\n\nProperty developer Keppel Land recorded its first repurchase since buybacks were introduced by the Exchange in June 1999 with 130,000 shares purchased on Feb 14 at $3.21 each.\n\nThe trade was made on the back of the 14 per cent drop in the share price since October 2013 from $3.73. The counter was also down since January 2013 from $4.31. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since December 2011 from $2.22.\n\nThe company announced on Jan 22 a 7.1 per cent gain in fourth quarter profit to $584.435 million, while earnings for the full year rose by 4.5 per cent to $903.954 million. The stock closed at $3.21 on Friday.\n\nBiosensors International Group\n\nMedical devices developer and manufacturer Biosensors International picked up where it left off in January with 300,000 shares purchased on Feb 14 at 87 cents each.\n\nThe buyback was made after the company announced on Feb 12 a 55 per cent drop in third quarter profit to US$11.125 million. Earnings in the first nine months fell by 60 per cent to US$34.48 million. The group previously acquired 6.4 million shares from Dec 30, 2013 to Jan 8 at an average of 84 cents each, 21.017 million shares from Aug 12 to Oct 7, 2013 at 84 cents to 97 cents each or an average of 88 cents each and 12.75 million shares from April 19 to June 17, 2013 at an average of $1.16 each. Prior to the repurchases since April 2013, the company acquired 19.77 million shares from November to December 2012 at an average of $1.11 each. The counter closed at 87 cents on Friday.\n\nCordlife Group\n\nPrivate cord blood banking services provider Cordlife Group bought back for the first time since November 2012 with 360,000 shares purchased from Feb 12 to 14 at an average of $1.19 each.\n\nThe trades, which accounted for 11 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 16 per cent drop in the share price since September 2013 from $1.42. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since March 2013 from 62 cents.\n\nThe acquisitions were also made after the company announced on Feb 11 a 25 per cent drop in second quarter profit to $4.232 million. Earnings in the first half, however, rose by 52.9 per cent to $12.9 million. The group previously acquired 200,000 shares on Nov 21, 2012 at 51.5 cents each.\n\nAlso positive this quarter are non-executive director Jin Lu, chairman Ho Choon Hou and FIL Limited. Non-executive director Jin Lu purchased 100,000 shares from Jan 14 to 17 at an average of $1.22 each, which increased her direct holdings by 15 per cent to 750,000 shares or 0.28 per cent of the issued capital. She previously sold one million shares in May 2013 at $1.02 each. Chairman Ho Choon Hou, on the other hand, acquired 60,000 shares on Jan 2 at $1.20 each, which boosted his direct stake by 10 per cent to 684,000 shares or 0.26 per cent. The chairman previously acquired 35,000 shares in October 2012 at 58 cents each.\n\nLastly, FIL Ltd reported a purchase-related filing on Jan 7 of 210,000 shares at $1.18 each, which increased its deemed holdings to 24.183 million shares or 9.05 per cent. The group previously sold 69,000 shares on Oct 23, 2013 at $1.00 each. Prior to that sale, the shareholder acquired a net 9.87 million shares from July 2 to Oct 9, 2013 at $1.06 to $1.34 each. Overall, FIL's stake is up by 59 per cent since July 2013. The stock closed at $1.18 on Friday.\n\nSuntec Real Estate Investment Trust\n\nDirector Lim Hwee Chiang recorded his first on-market buys in real estate investment trust Suntec Reit since the unit trust was listed in December 2004 with an initial 1.000 million units (direct interest) purchased from Jan 27 to 28 at an average of $1.60 each. The holdings represent 0.04 per cent of the issued capital. The purchases were made on the back of the 7 per cent rebound in the unit price since December 2013 from $1.49. Despite the rebound in the unit price, the counter is still down since October 2013 from $1.74.\n\nThis recent purchase was very unusual as Mr Lim was a heavy seller from 2005 to 2013 with a whopping 70.86 million units sold worth $97 million at $1.15 to $1.85 each or an average of $1.37 each.\n\nInvestors should note that there were purchases by directors Vincent Chen Wei Ching and Yeo See Kiat in December 2013. Vincent Chen purchased 60,000 units on Dec 19, 2013 at $1.50 each, which increased his direct holdings by 20 per cent to 360,000 units or 0.02 per cent. He previously acquired 50,000 units in August 2013 at $1.53 each and 50,000 units in July 2013 at an average of $1.58 each.\n\nYeo See Kiat, on the other hand, acquired 200,000 units on Dec 17, 2013 at $1.50 each, which boosted his direct stake by 62 per cent to 525,000 units or 0.02 per cent. He also has deemed interest of 450,000 units or 0.02 per cent. He previously acquired 100,000 units on Nov 22, 2013 at $1.555 each and 100,000 units in May 2013 at $1.81 each. The unit trust closed at $1.64 on Friday.\n\nDukang Distillers Holdings\n\nFIL Limited recorded its first sale in baijiu products manufacturer and distributor Dukang Distillers Holdings since it became a substantial shareholder in August 2013 with a disposal-related filing on Feb 11 of 361,000 shares at 22 cents each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 55.861 million shares or 6.99 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nThe filing was made on the back of the 49 per cent drop in the share price since November 2013 from 43.5 cents. The sale was also made three days before Dukang Distillers announced 93 per cent drop in second quarter profit to 10.039 million yuan. Earnings in the first half fell by 80.5 per cent to 40.493 million yuan.\n\nFIL Ltd previously acquired 16.7 million shares from Aug 30 to Oct 8, 2013 at 42 cents to 46 cents each and an initial filing on Aug 29, 2013 of 1.049 million shares at 43 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.12 per cent. The counter closed at 21.5 cents on Friday.\n\nRaffles Medical Group\n\nAberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited recorded its first sale in private integrated healthcare provider Raffles Medical Group since it became a substantial shareholder in November 2012 with a disposal-related filing on Feb 7 of 240,000 shares at $3.05 each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 38.722 million shares or 6.99 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 11 per cent drop in the share price since the last week of April 2013 from $3.44.\n\nThe group previously reported a purchase-related filing in April 2013 of 325,000 shares at $3.31 each, a purchase-related filing in February 2013 of 195,000 shares at $3.20 each and an initial filing in November 2012 of 159,000 shares at $2.42 each, which raised its interest to 5.0 per cent. The stock closed at $3.17 on Friday.\n\nKeppel Corporation\n\nAberdeen Asset Management Plc recorded its first sale in shipping, property, and infrastructure firm Keppel Corporation since it became a substantial shareholder in January 2013 with a disposal-related filing on Feb 10 of 1.18 million shares at $10.32 each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 107.705 million shares or 5.95 per cent. The filing was made on the back of the 9 per cent drop in the share price since December 2013 from $11.33.\n\nThe group previously reported a purchase-related filing in August 2013 of 90,000 shares at $10.31 each and an initial filing in January 2013 of 438,000 shares at $11.16 each, which raised its interest to 5.02 per cent.\n\nInvestors should note that executive director Tong Chong Heong unloaded 50,000 shares in November 2013 at $11.30 each, which lowered his direct stake to 2.465 million shares or 0.14 per cent. He previously sold 150,000 shares from March to April 2011 at an average of $12.33 each. The stock closed at $10.43 on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Limited\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Financial markets are likely to experience a repeat of what happened last May and June, after then-Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the US will soon slow down its bond purchases.\n\n\"Everything was hit. Everything fell, (equities), government bonds, corporate bonds. As a multi-asset manager, that's the worst environment,\" said Mr Gould, who is chief investment officer for Hong Kong Multi-Asset and Wealth and advises pension and insurance funds.\n\nGrowth \"feeds on itself\" and investors might start to worry about inflation again, given that a large pool of money is in the financial system after many years of loose monetary conditions.\n\n\"You throw all that new money into the system, more money should devalue money. That hasn't happened because the structure of the global economy is weak, there's excess global capacity. But if the capacity gets worked out, it could be less than we think.\n\n\"In that environment, cash is king. That's the only time you want cash, if you're quite confident that everything else will produce a negative return,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Gould said the situation of strong global growth causing increases in interest rate is his least expected scenario, one he assigned a 15 per cent chance of happening.\n\nThe base case, which he assigned a two-thirds probability to, is that of \"steady, unspectacular growth\" and minimal inflation - the consensus view. In this scenario, equities will do well, followed by corporate bonds.\n\nThe final possibility, with a 20 per cent chance, is that the recovery falters and interest rates stay low. This can happen with a scheduled consumption tax hike in Japan, or when slowing China growth causes the global recovery to stall. In such a scenario, investors should hold long-dated government bonds and corporate bonds, he said.\n\nCurrently, he is \"overweight equities, overweight corporate bonds, just moving shorter in duration, building up cash - we would sell 10-year Treasuries below 2.7 per cent, and be buyers at 3-plus\". The yield for 10-year Treasuries was 2.58 per cent last week and 2.86 per cent last month.\n\nMr Gould also commented on the recent market wobble, when a confluence of China financial sector worries, slowing growth, US tapering bond purchases and disparate emerging market worries conspired to cause a 5 to 10 per cent correction in global markets.\n\nThe major reason for Asia's underperformance is concerns over shadow banking in China, he noted, pointing to the near-default of a wealth management product that had raised funds for a failed coal miner. His clients in Hong Kong are worried, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of bad debt and unproductive investments in the Chinese financial system. The big concern is that this will somehow unwind in a disorderly fashion.\"\n\nMr Gould believes the situation can be managed by the Chinese government, and losses shared by the state-owned Chinese banks. Even so, investors in China will have the fear of a financial market collapse hanging over them for a long time to come, he said.\n\n\"The lack of trust and corporate governance issues will keep China cheap, and the sense of credit losses will continue to constrain it,\" he said.\n\nMr Gould, who picks stocks based on their fundamentals, reckons that opportunities abound in Asia. South Korea is among his favourites because of its low valuations and cyclical stocks that will benefit from a global recovery. However, he is unimpressed by Japan - a favourite of analysts - because he thinks profits will not be delivered.\n\n\"If the Japanese economy fades and Abenomics (the economic policies of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) is suddenly thought to be a failure, the downside in Japan is pretty big because it just had a very large jump.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In contrast, these five listed companies have a total of 38 other non-executive directors whose combined directors' fees approved at annual general meetings was under $7 million, or an average of about $180,000 per director.\n\nIt may appear ironic that the relatively small sums of the non-executive directors' fees are subject to shareholder approval at each AGM, while the much larger sums paid to the CEOs are not. In reality, executive compensation is determined by the non-executive directors forming the Remuneration Committee of the listed company.\n\nSince the global financial crisis, income inequality and executive compensation has become a flashpoint. In particular, the ratio of the pay of the top executive to the average worker has been seized upon to illustrate how outrageous it has become.\n\nAccording to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the top US CEO pay relative to the pay of the average worker has widened from 42 times in 1982 to 353 times in 2012. In response to the groundswell of protests, the Sarbanes-Oxley and the Dodd-Frank Acts laid out some rules requiring new reporting procedures and increasing the extent to which directors can be held to be personally liable for pay excesses.\n\nIn Switzerland last year, voters backed the \"against corporate rip-offs\" referendum. Swiss lawmakers now have to draft a law giving shareholders the right to hold a binding vote on all compensation for company executives and directors.\n\nIn Singapore, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has also been growing but has not yet reached the US level. A Business Times study put the average CEO-to-employee pay ratio at 122 times based on the six largest listed companies in 2010.\n\nThe question increasingly being asked is: How and who should put a check on high executive compensation?\n\nThe current legal position is that directors' fees are subject to shareholders' approval, while executive pay is subject to directors' approval.\n\nThat's how companies are constituted and governed. Shareholders elect the directors and agree to their fees. The directors have the power and responsibility to manage the affairs of the company, including hiring, firing and compensating the management team.\n\nAn executive director, meanwhile, wears an additional hat as an employee of the company. Employment terms are contractual matters between the employee and the company, which are matters under the purview of the board.\n\nAs such, if enough shareholders are unhappy with the performance of the board, they can (in extreme cases) remove the whole board, but they cannot remove the CEO or management of the company or determine how much to pay them. Only the board has that power.\n\nIn its recent review of the Companies Act, the Steering Committee appointed by the Minister of Finance had the opportunity to change this position. However, for better or worse, the decision was made to retain the distinction between the powers of shareholders and that of the board.\n\nThere are good reasons to retain this separation of powers. Directors have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the long-term interests of the company. Shareholders owe no such duty.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that, generally, the outlook of shareholders are short-term in nature. It is not uncommon to see shareholders attempting to hold listed companies to ransom out of their own self-interest, say, by demanding more dividends, without considering the broader and long-term cash-flow needs and other issues facing the company.\n\nHowever, giving the board unfettered power to decide on executive pay may lead to the negative trends on executive pay seen in the US and Europe. Current regulations in Singapore primarily emphasise disclosure. For example, Guideline 9.2 of the 2012 Code of Corporate Governance states that \"the company should fully disclose the remuneration of each individual director and the CEO on a named basis\".\n\nA step further is to get shareholders' feedback through a non-binding vote to approve executive pay packages at the general meeting. This is being legislated in a growing number of countries including Germany, Australia, the UK and the US. The aim is that the vote will be a highly influential signal to a board to not raise salaries beyond reasonable levels.\n\nWhile such \"say on pay\" legislation has not yet arrived in Singapore, it pays for boards to be sensitive to the current environment of perceived inequality and to increase the level of monitoring and oversight on executive remuneration. And ultimately, it is the shareholders who will decide how they want to hold the board they appoint accountable.\n\nThe writer is the first vice-chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the increased reliance on Internet Protocol-based applications and processes means widening corporations' threat surface, and Palo Alto Networks believes this migration emphasises the need for more intelligent, proactive network security software.\n\nAccording to Sharat Sinha, Asia-Pacific VP at Palo Alto Networks, this year will see a heightened need for more intelligent network security software. In this new era of securing the Internet gateways, such software will require more automated processes and in-built intelligence in order to \"detect, prevent and provide remediation\" should there be an attack on an organisation's network, he stated.\n\n\"This is especially important in industries such as government, education and healthcare, in which there are staffing shortages. Limited staff need maximum resources including security tools that give them the most visibility into their network traffic (yet) don't sacrifice business productivity,\" Mr Sinha said.\n\nHe noted that legacy security tools such as firewalls are no longer sufficient in capabilities and scale. Elaborating, the executive told BizIT that one such limitation of legacy tools is how its main focus is on detection while preventive capabilities are mostly manual. This means should an attack be detected on the network, internal IT staff will have to manually react and fend off the threat and this might not be possible if it was a large-scale attack.\n\nAnother limitation is in intelligence sharing. He observed that the sharing of information regarding potential malware attacks is not possible with legacy software, whereas products such as Palo Alto Networks' WildFire tool is cloud-based and offer real-time updates to all customers in its network.\n\n\"When an unknown malware is detected, our system immediately assigns a signature to it and releases the information to the cloud and all of our customers in the network,\" the executive explained.\n\nMr Sinha pointed to one local example that illustrated the inefficacy of legacy network security products. The unnamed conglomerate, which has businesses in steel and chemicals among others, was using outmoded firewalls and endpoint security software, which resulted in some trusted machines getting compromised. This, in turn, brought down its network for a significant period of time and proved costly for the organisation, he said.\n\nWhile Mr Sinha did not know the exact nature of the attack, the Palo Alto executive said firewalls tend to protect the network via ports but not the actual application. So if the malware was piggybacking an existing application through the port, it would have not been stopped. This, he said, was just one of the many possible ways to penetrate the conglomerate's inadequate network security measures.\n\nSince migrating to the company's WildFire product, the conglomerate has yet to face similar downtimes, according to him.\n\nMr Sinha believes more corporate organisations would be looking to upgrade their existing network security regime. This is because aside from tech-savvy industries such as financial services and government, others such as retail, healthcare, higher education and hospitality will face increased attention from hackers as they leverage more on IT to boost productivity.\n\nFor example, he said, the retail industry is huge in Singapore and contributes significantly to the nation's gross domestic product. However, companies face the same challenge as those faced by giant US retailer Target, which revealed its point-of-sale (POS) terminals infected with a malware designed to bypass PCI DSS encryption methods to steal customers' payment data.\n\nTarget first revealed last December that 40 million consumers were affected in the leak of payment card details, as well as other personal information such as mailing and e-mail addresses, following the POS system breach. It has since updated the figure to up to 70 million consumers in January this year.\n\nGiven that POS terminals are all linked to the network, the threat - whether in the US or Singapore - is relevant to all retailers, Mr Sinha said.\n\nTo better combat network security breaches, he advised companies to first look at their internal processes to determine what are the business-critical applications used. Once done, they should create network segmentation by which only employees who need to access such data can access it over the network.\n\nThis \"zero-trust\" network will detect and analyse every data transaction sent through the corporate network, which is a deeper inspection than those provided by firewalls that look only at ports and proxies, Mr Sinha said.\n\n\"Segmenting the network not only helps with detection of malware, it also helps localise the threat when it happens, find and fix the source of problem, and lower the chance of the same attack happening again,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But having found success in the IT industry, the Russian entrepreneur is betting on storage's upward track, and returned to the company he co-founded after being away for eight years.\n\nMr Beloussov was last CEO at Acronis in 2007. At the time, the company was turning over US$150 million in revenue annually, when he decided to focus on Acronis's sister company, virtualisation software vendor Parallels. Parallels and Acronis were born in 2003, when SWsoft, founded by Mr Beloussov in 1997, split into two separate businesses.\n\nHe explained his departure: \"I had a disagreement with a professional board member that we hired to run (Acronis), so I disengaged.\"\n\nThat year, Parallels had about 900 staff, and counted among enterprise clients large firms such as KDDI and StarHub.\n\nMr Beloussov is still the largest shareholder at Parallels, with a 50 per cent stake in the private company. In May last year, he decided to leave his role as its CEO, returning to Acronis at the helm.\n\n\"I'm back because of the opportunity in storage. I've built eight companies over the years, but none of them have hit US$1 billion in revenue yet. Acronis is my chance,\" he said.\n\nHe's eyeing the fast-growing storage and back-up industry which is expected to hit US$30 billion in sales by 2016. \"The growing need for storage is inevitable,\" Mr Berloussov. This is being prompted by larger industry trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) and the constant generation of media from consumers and enterprise users.\n\nIoT is a catchphrase describing a network of connected devices outside traditional computing gadgets. This includes smart fridges, or wearable technology that incorporate sensors to track data and connects to the Internet to communicate with other devices. Gartner predicts that as the cost of components go down and more manufacturers pack connectivity into their products, the IoT will grow to 26 billion units installed in 2020 - nearly 30 times the 900 million in 2009. This will translate to a US$300 billion market for the IoT's product and service suppliers, with services taking the lion's share of that pie in 2020.\n\nThe IoT will also exceed the number of \"traditional\" devices - smartphones, tablets and PCs - in 2020, which will reach 7.3 billion units.\n\nMr Beloussov said that his first task last year was to restore the \"original DNA\" at Acronis, refocusing on technology innovation. \"I felt it was time to polish our technology, to make it faster and better,\" he said.\n\nAcronis has two research labs globally, in the US and Russia. In Singapore, the company is collaborating with A*Star's (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) DSI (Data Storage Institute) arm to further research on storage technology.\n\n\"With them, we're looking to polish our cloud and mobility access products,\" he said.\n\nAcronis is looking to roll out an enterprise-focused cloud service for Asia in the later part of the third quarter of this year, after it partners with a data centre provider to establish physical storage here.\n\nWith data sovereignty a sticky issue for many enterprises, situating a cloud data centre here is necessary if the company wants to attract corporate clients in Singapore. Currently, it has data centres in Europe and the US, where its enterprise customers there and global consumer data is being stored.\n\nMr Beloussov said that the company's cloud business now contributes about 10-15 per cent of revenue and this is growing quickly and is on track to cross the 20 per cent mark next year.\n\nHe is certain the company's next phase of growth will come from Asia. \"Historically, we didn't focus much on the region - well, I did, but our American managers didn't. Now, I'm back and I'm re-focusing on the largest and fastest moving market,\" he said.\n\nA third of Acronis's business comes from Asia - unusual for a global software firm, where Asia typically contributes about 10 per cent, he noted. The company's largest market in the region here is Japan, and he hopes to eventually move Acronis's global headquarters to Singapore within the next five years.\n\nMr Beloussov came to Singapore in 1994, after co-founding a PC start-up in Russia called Falcon Computers. He later started a company called Solomon Software in 1996, and took up Singapore citizenship in 2001.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With a combined mineral resource and ore reserve of 30.1 million tonnes representing a total contained 7.2 million carats, the project is the second-largest combined diamond resource and reserve in Australia, said Blumont.\n\nIn January, Blumont made a takeover bid for Australia-listed mineral miner Genesis Resources. It offered 5.3 Blumont shares at an implied price of 7.19 cents apiece for every two Genesis shares, which would give Genesis shareholders a 16.48 per cent stake in Blumont if the offer is accepted. The aggregate consideration was a maximum of about A$32.5 million.\n\nIn October last year, Blumont was among three penny stocks which lost about S$8 billion in market capitalisation, following a dramatic crash in their share prices.\n\nBlumont shares ended 0.3 cent higher at 6.9 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Branson hit back, saying the description \"would be flattering if it was not so laughable\" and asking what that made Qantas, \"which is four times our size\". \"Should the Australian taxpayer be forced by the government to prop up the Qantas group as Treasurer Joe Hockey is suggesting, business people worldwide should think twice about investing in Australia for fear of such intervention in their sectors,\" he said.\n\n\"Qantas has gone cap in hand to the government. If the government fills their hat, it will severely damage competition in Australia.\"\n\nLast December, Qantas said it was facing some of its toughest-ever challenges as it flagged a half-year loss of up to A$300 million (S$341 million) and the axing of 1,000 jobs. It reports its interim first- half results later this month.\n\nMr Branson said Qantas already received most government travel spending and \"should not be granted further special privileges over all its competitors\", noting that until Virgin arrived on the scene in 2000, Qantas \"enjoyed a virtual monopoly in most parts of the Australian market\".\n\nThe Virgin founder said he did not care what the government did with the Qantas foreign ownership cap. \"What is most important is that the government doesn't provide financial assistance to Qantas, enabling it to reinstate its monopoly. It's not right for the industry and won't benefit the Australian travelling public or economy.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE unstable economy of the last couple of years may have made people pull back on their spending - but it hasn't stopped balding men from ponying up for hair transplants. In fact, the demand for this procedure is growing, says last year's practice census of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, the number of surgical hair-restoration procedures grew 10 per cent. The region where the highest number of such procedures were done? Asia, with 102,702 procedures in 2012.\n\nMost of the patients - 86.3 per cent - were men, and more than half were aged 30 to 49. Chow Yuen Ho of TCS Aesthetics Central Clinic Robotic Hair Restoration service says that the rising numbers come on the back of improvements in technology that have minimised scarring, shortened recovery and downtime.\n\nARTAS robotic hair restoration makes use of digital imaging and precision robotics to scan and grade each hair so that the healthiest - and best-placed - hairs are harvested for transplant to balding areas.\n\nDr Chow, who has more than 10 years of clinical experience and a special interest in aesthetic dermatological procedures and lasers, says: \"Optimal spacing is maintained between each hair, preserving the natural look of the donor area. Unlike older transplant methods, no stitches are required, and therefore, there's no risk of a visible linear scar.\"\n\nThe traditional method of hair restoration, called Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), is more invasive. It entails the surgical removal of a piece of scalp from the back and sides of the head, and the use of stitches or staples to close the wound. The strip of scalp is then handed to a group of technicians, who then manually separate the individual follicular units. These dissected follicular units are then transplanted onto the balding areas of the scalp by the surgical team.\n\nA recovery period of several weeks would typically follow, and patients may suffer numbness, scalp tightness or lingering pain after that.\n\nAnd then there is also the obvious linear scar and hairstyle limitations to contend with, adds Dr Chow.\n\nHair transplants are the only permanent solution to hair loss, he adds. Pills and creams may slow hair loss with continual use, but once these are stopped, their benefits stop as well.\n\nDr Chow says that the average person sheds between 50 and 100 hairs a day - a drop in the ocean, considering there are roughly 100,000 hairs on one's head.\n\nIt may be a first sign of hair loss, however, if one notices a significant amount of hair left behind on comb, pillow or shower stall grating.\n\nIn more than 95 per cent of cases, hair thinning in men is caused by androgenic alopecia, or male pattern baldness. This is a common hereditary condition resulting in hair follicles at the top and front of the head becoming sensitive to the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The hair in those regions becomes thinner over time. Eventually, the follicle becomes dormant.\n\nHealthy hair follicles resistant to DHT are usually on the sides and back of the head, but these may even get weaker and finer in time, says Dr Chow.\n\nHe likens the cutting-edge ARTAS approach to a normal visit to the dentist - just more pleasant.\n\nA local anaesthetic is administered so the patient stays awake through the procedure; he may even want to listen to music or watch a movie or take scheduled breaks during the procedure.\n\nBefore it, the physician would have developed a treatment plan based on goals, hair type and personal characteristics.\n\n\"During your procedure, the physician will transplant each hair individually. For most procedures, a new hairline is created and thinning interior areas are filled in,\" he says.\n\nThe transplanted hair, which is unaffected by the DHT hormone, takes root in a few weeks and grows. Patients see significant growth after about six months.\n\nThe cost of treatment depends on the amount of new hair desired, and will generally start from a ballpark figure of $5,500.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The China assets will eventually be listed in an initial public offering in Hong Kong or Singapore that might be larger than Q&M's own market value here.\n\n\"Because of these four projects we have created a lot of interest in the Chinese dental market. More and more people have come to talk to us about deals and funding,\" CEO Ng Chin Siau told The Business Times in a recent interview.\n\nThe broking community is also sitting up. Maybank Kim Eng Research initiated coverage on the company last October with a \"buy\" call and a target price of 41 cents, calling it the \"rarest gem in global dentistry\". It raised its target price to 48 cents last Thursday. The same day, Voyage Research's deputy head of research, Ng Kian Teck, who has covered the company since 2010, also raised his intrinsic value of the company to 57.5 cents.\n\nIn its initiation report last year, Maybank Kim Eng said that Q&M is \"the best-performing by margins, ROE (returns on equity) and growth in a sector where only four listed peers can be found (and) the cheapest. This scarcity value and strong balance sheet makes Q&M itself ripe for acquisition.\"\n\nWhat made analysts excited were the chain's growth prospects in the untapped private dental market in China, where disposable incomes are growing, public hospitals tend to be overcrowded and smaller clinics unpopular. Q&M already has a steadily growing business at home with 57 dental clinics, a database of 600,000 patients and 6,000 to 9,000 new walk-ins a month.\n\n\"How big can we grow? The sky is the limit. We are already the largest dental player in the Asean region and the only company that is listed,\" Dr Ng says.\n\nGoing forward, Q&M will focus on growing outside Singapore, and especially in China. \"Singapore only has a population of 5.3 million. Malaysia has 28 million, Indonesia 250 million, and China, 1.3 billion. China has more than 100 cities of more than one million people,\" he notes.\n\nThe Chinese government is also liberalising the medical healthcare sector there, with rules put in place that allow foreigners to own 100 per cent of companies there.\n\n\"I only have six dental hospitals. but there are 1,000 dental hospitals in China. There are 136,000 dentists in China, I'm only having 200. When I have 1,000 dentists there I'll be the single largest dental operation in China.\"\n\nThe strategy of acquiring dental hospitals in China is a lesson well learnt after four years of failing to gain traction with smaller clinics. Q&M began acquiring dental clinics from 2010, starting in Beijing and Nanjing. This eventually expanded to 10 clinics currently, with four in Beijing, four in Nanjing and two in Shanghai. But the clinics struggled to attract patients. \"It took us a long time to understand that in China, people don't trust dental clinics,\" Dr Ng says.\n\nIn private dental clinics, patients could not swipe their state medical insurance card, or yibaoka, to get subsidies from the government. Some 80 to 90 per cent of the Chinese population have this card. \"Yibao is a deep-rooted concept, where all patients go to hospitals when they have a problem,\" Dr Ng says.\n\nPatients also try to bargain down prices at smaller clinics, which they do not do at hospitals. The insurance card can be used at approved dental hospitals, even private ones. These private hospitals are run by people with good relationships with the government, Dr Ng says. All six dental hospitals he is acquiring have yibao-approved status, he added.\n\nSo the bigger hospitals were the way to go.\n\n\"It's a learning curve. We took smaller risks initially when we bought into all these smaller clinics; the commitment was 10 million yuan ($2.1 million) per clinic,\" Dr Ng says.\n\nAnd while the patient inflow and the returns on investments are higher, the first few years of a new hospital's operations may be loss-making, Dr Ng notes.\n\nAfter a couple of years of searching for a suitable dental hospital investment, an opportunity finally arrived. Last July, in the largest deal in the history of Q&M, the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MOUs) to acquire a 60 per cent stake of Shenyang-based Aoxin Stomatology Group for $21.6 million. Aoxin owns three dental hospitals, three dental clinics, and a training centre.\n\nThe acquisition, to be paid for in shares and cash, is the first and largest China deal Q&M is involved in. It was effectively completed last Tuesday, with an announcement made. \"They wanted to do an IPO exercise on their own for a while, but they're too small, and they know we want to do one,\" Dr Ng says.\n\nThe three remaining China deals are for Q&M to acquire two dental hospitals in Donggang and Dandong cities, also in Liaoning province like Shenyang, and a dental hospital and clinic in Weihai city, in nearby Shandong province. It is also acquiring Aidite, a zirconium oxide manufacturer in Qinhuangdao, Hebei province.\n\nZirconia blocks are used in a CAD/CAM machine, a computer-aided technology that can do tooth restorations in one hour or within the same day for a more complicated operation, instead of a few weeks traditionally. Q&M has invested in a number of these machines.\n\n\"The porcelain material is harder, more translucent like a natural tooth, patients can accept it. We strongly believe the market will go in this direction,\" Dr Ng says. \"Now the machine is too expensive, but cheaper ones are coming out, and when patients know of it they will ask.\"\n\nThe China acquisitions came after an aborted attempt to acquire Singapore Medical Group after a material change in the latter's financial performance. When the deal was first announced in end-2012, Q&M originally meant to expand into the medical services business. \"I learnt a lot about due diligence and applied the process to the China projects,\" Dr Ng says. \"I think I'm more comfortable now dealing with dental hospitals and dentistry, which I understand very well compared to medicine.\"\n\nDr Ng, who sold his three-room flat to finance the takeover of a dental clinic in Bukit Batok in 1996 and built up his chain since, has come a long way. Funding is no longer a problem, with the company sitting on $20 million of cash, a US$15 million loan from World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and a $200 million medium term note programme from HSBC. \"Now money is going out, I must make sure money comes in. Manpower, operational controls, all must be in place. We need to integrate and make sure everybody involved is happy with each other,\" Dr Ng says.\n\n\"I'm aiming to close the deals by the second quarter this year. My share price is moving, I need to close the deals soon,\" he quipped.\n\n\"I've spent the past three to four years understanding China's market and learnt the hard way. We did not lose money, just broke even, but it was a steep learning curve, and we're now prepared to grow aggressively, in a calculated way.\"\n\nQ&M closed last Friday at 37.5 cents.\n\nhaoxiang@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net interest income rose 13.3 per cent to $1.1 billion.\n\nFor the full year, net profit rose 7.3 per cent to $3 billion, or $1.84 per share, with net interest margin at 1.72 per cent as net interest income grew 5.2 per cent to a new high of $4.1 billion.\n\nStreet estimates were for a $2.8 billion profit, according to a poll of 21 analysts by Bloomberg.\n\nUOB, which paid out 50 cents per share after its fourth quarter a year ago, is recommending 55 cents per share this year, comprising a 50-cent final dividend and a five-cent special dividend. The bank also paid a 20-cent interim dividend at the mid-year, bringing its full-year payout to 75 cents.\n\nUOB shares closed at $19.90 yesterday, down by 0.4 per cent or eight cents, before the results were announced.\n\nDespite a positive 2013, the year ahead is expected to see more moderate growth, the bank said.\n\n\"On the macro front, the world is adjusting to (quantitative easing) tapering,\" Mr Wee said. \"In Asia, concerns have surfaced about capital outflows and China's debt issue, among others.\"\n\nUOB expects loans growth to moderate to a high single-digit growth in 2014 against a slowing Asian economy. Net interest margin is expected to stay flat in the year ahead.\n\nFees are also expected to maintain their growth momentum in 2014 amid strength in the loans and wealth management businesses. Mr Wee said double-digit fees growth should continue this year.\n\nMr Wee reckoned that concerns about Asian vulnerability may be overblown in light of the nature of capital movements as well as the considerably stronger balances held by regional governments compared to during the 19197 Asian financial crisis.\n\n\"We believe the near-term impact of capital outflows from emerging markets should be manageable given their stronger balance sheets,\" he said, noting that outflows are likely to occur with financial, rather than strategic, investors.\n\n\"Importantly, the underlying economy and business flows are resilient given the ample opportunities in Asia with its rising middle income and intra-regional trade and investments,\" Mr Wee said. \"These are areas UOB focuses on in growing our franchise business.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It might take him some time, however, depending on how many details you can provide him with, but the most important information would be the year of death, the dialect group, the person's name, as well as the names of his or her children.\n\n\"I can find it within a few hours if the details are enough and if he is buried in Bukit Brown. Sometimes I get so excited I drop everything to run and go look for it,\" says 50-year-old Mr Goh, who retains his full-time job as the director of a healthcare company and hunts down tombs as a hobby.\n\n\"But most of them take time, especially if there aren't enough details. So I can't actively look out for one. But it will be there at the back of my mind,\" he adds.\n\nSo far, his success rate is around 50 per cent, and the longest he has taken to locate a tomb is two years.\n\nHe uses a combination of different methods - for instance, \"outsourcing\" it to his friends, the tomb keepers. Since these are people who maintain the tombs on a regular basis, he asks them to help him keep an eye out once he receives a request. Other times, he relies on his own knowledge of history and Chinese culture, which he has gathered since he was young, to help him recognise different symbols and markings on each tombstone.\n\nMr Goh admits that it can be quite a mammoth task to track down the location of one tomb out of about 250,000, in almost 400 acres of forested cemeteries, including the Bukit Brown Cemetery, Seh Ong Cemetery, Lau Sua and Kopi Sua. In fact, only a handful of people are still able to do that because it takes too much time and dedication. He himself has spent at least three hours every weekend exploring the cemeteries for the last seven years.\n\n\"Many people can trace their own lineage nowadays, especially when you can do online tracing. It's easier. And maybe they can find the names (of their ancestors), but not the place. Those people who can really search and find the physical tombs like me, I can count on my two hands,\" says Mr Goh.\n\nHis own interest was piqued in 2006, when he visited Bukit Brown cemetery with his brother one day and noticed a tomb with the year 1842 engraved on the stone. Realising the potential historical value of the cemetery, he decided to devote some time to studying the history of the place.\n\nSince then, he has seen more and more requests from people in search of their ancestry, and gets more than 10 requests a month compared to the initial one or two. \"In the past when Singapore was still at the stage of development, a lot of people were more concerned with the struggle to make a living.

This was 8 per cent higher than the $663 million a year ago.\n\nOCBC CEO Samuel Tsien said that the bank's net interest margin (NIM), a key measure of lending profitability, should remain stable at about \"1.6 plus per cent\" in the year ahead. The bank is also focusing on higher-growth territories outside of its Singapore base like Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Hong Kong. It is raising US dollar deposits so it can lend more in US dollars, notably to China corporates.\n\nCosts are expected to rise percentage wise in the \"single digits\" for the year ahead due to technology investments and compliance requirements. Loan growth is targeted to slow to the \"low teens\" from 18 per cent year-on-year growth in 2013.\n\nOn the home front, new applications for housing loans have fallen by 40 to 50 per cent, but the bank expects its healthy inventory levels of loans to drive growth in the next two years. Mr Tsien said the global economic outlook is positive. \"There will be events that cause capital flows between continents, we need to be careful about that,\" he said.\n\nCore income for the quarter was up 2 per cent to $1.71 billion. This comprised net interest income, which grew 12 per cent to $1.03 billion, and non-interest income, which fell 10 per cent to $679 million. Net interest income went up due to steady asset and deposit growth.\n\nNon-interest income was affected by a 49 per cent plunge in net trading income to $69 million and lower contributions from life insurance arm Great Eastern - life assurance profit declined 22 per cent to $165 million. Mr\n\nTsien said trading income is a \"market-dependent activity\", and the insurance income drop was due to unrealised mark-to-market losses not reflective of a strong underlying insurance business. \"New premium sales are up 27 per cent year on year, and new business embedded value (a measure of future profits in today's terms) is up 22 per cent,\" Mr Tsien said.\n\nOCBC declared a final dividend of 17 cents a share, unchanged from a year ago. Shareholders can opt to receive the payment in the form of shares. The total dividend for 2013 is 34 cents, up a cent from a year ago. This represents a yield of 3.6 per cent on its Friday closing price of $9.38. OCBC stock had been battered since the beginning of the year upon news of its takeover of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank. Investors have feared that OCBC is overpaying for the acquisition. But the counter has since staged a recovery after closing at a one-year low of $9.09 on Feb 4.\n\nYesterday, Mr Tsien declined to give new information on the takeover, citing Hong Kong takeover rules where he cannot provide new information or opinions on the transaction. \"If the transaction proceeds, we will be sure to make any detailed announcements as appropriate, on the most timely basis,\" he said.\n\nFor 2013, OCBC recorded a full-year core net profit excluding divestment gains of $2.77 billion, 2 per cent lower compared to 2012. Total core income was unchanged at $6.6 billion, with net interest income up 4 per cent to $3.9 billion and non-interest income down 5 per cent to $2.7 billion. For non-interest income, growth in fees and commission income for wealth management, loan-related, fund management, brokerage and credit card was negated by a sharp fall in net trading income.\n\nUnder the interest income segment, loan growth was 18 per cent in 2013 to $170 billion at end-2013. All segments registered growth. Greater China saw the most, rising 56 per cent to $27 billion. Singapore, the largest segment, was up 12 per cent to $84 billion. There was a notable 44 per cent surge in US-dollar denominated loans to $46 billion.\n\nCustomer deposits grew 19 per cent year on year to $196 billion, with fixed deposits seeing a $10-billion jump in the last three months of 2013 due to OCBC fighting for its share of the pie amid numerous other bank campaigns advertising higher rates. Singapore dollar and US dollar deposits increased the most, with OCBC raising the latter to fund its US dollar loan book growth.\n\nNIM, the difference between interest income from loans and interest payments to depositors relative to interest earning assets, fell to 1.64 per cent in 2013 from 1.77 per cent in 2012. This was due to the persistently low interest rate environment, where the cost of borrowing is low and competition heated up for existing mortgage loans. While 2013's NIM marked a third consecutive year of declines, Mr Tsien noted that it has stabilised at the 1.64 per cent mark effectively throughout all four quarters in 2013.\n\nStability indicators remained healthy, with capital adequacy ratios above regulatory requirements. The non-performing loans ratio was down 0.1 percentage point to 0.7 per cent.\n\nAnalyst reports yesterday noted the results were in line with or above their expectations. \"A decent set of results on strong earnings top-line growth but focus will be on long-term strategy,\" said a Goldman Sachs note. OCBC closed at $9.38, up 5 cents or 0.5 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We are a legal operation, the bar has a liquor licence, so why don't we want people to talk about it?\" says Mr Bell, 28, who was in town this week as the guest judge for the second semi-final of the Diageo Reserve World Class Competition's Singapore championships. Mr Bell himself finished as the top US bartender in last year's competition, and an overall second in the global finals. \"We weren't meant to be hidden. The whole idea behind PDT stemmed from a fun way to separate the hot dog stand from the bar.\"\n\nFounded in 2006 by Brian Shebairo and Jim Meehan in a space vacated by a bubble tea shop in New York's East Village, entrance to the reservations-only PDT is via a dimly lit phone booth within Crif Dogs, a no-frills hot dog stand.\n\nIn the seven years since, the bar has garnered unparalleled success, with both the bar and Mr Meehan constantly topping global bar rankings, the latter even literally penning the book on speakeasies, The PDT Cocktail Book.\n\nSays Mr Bell of the Australian, Brazilian, Singaporean and myriad global tourists that now pack into PDT on a nightly basis: \"Historically, bars were not destination spots, they were just somewhere you stop by periodically. But people come to PDT now because they want to try the drinks, we're no longer just a neighbourhood bar.\"\n\nWhile he's not sweating the publicity nor the tourist to regulars ratio, what Mr Bell does find ironic, however, is the way Prohibition-era drinks are being romanticised and touted by speakeasies around the world.\n\n\"Traditional speakeasies weren't cocktail dens, they were hidden bars - and you couldn't drink very well in them. There were only illegal and homemade products during the Prohibition Era and all the bartenders left the industry,\" he says.\n\nThis is why the Prohibition Era is not an inspiration for the cocktail programme at PDT, which also means that he gets to concoct, inhibition-free, his signature potions such as the Lion's Den, a Japanese-inflected, togarashi and shishito pepper-dusted reboot of the margarita, and the Cuban cigar-inspired Romeo Y Julieta, which works in a subtle, smokey tobacco essence.\n\nBesides conducting a masterclass for local bartenders yesterday, Mr Bell also did a public guest bartending stint at Jigger and Pony on Thursday evening. The Amoy Street cocktail bar was made-over as a PDT pop-up, right down to its taxidermy wall mounts and darkened phone booth entrance.\n\n\"I am pleasantly surprised by the calibre of bartenders in Singapore,\" he says. \"A few at the top end were very well spoken, had great drinks, and a great story to tell. They're definitely of world-class calibre.\"\n\n\"There were some who could definitely work at PDT,\" he hints, adding that he prefers to hire younger people as bar backs and have them work their way up. \"We hire people based on their personality and work ethic. You can teach people how to make drinks, but you can't teach someone how to work hard.\"\n\nPutting in a hard slog, after all, was how he landed his coveted current role. A philosophy graduate from Seattle, Mr Bell got his break in 2010 when he was offered a bar back job at PDT while bartending for Mr Meehan's wife at the Gramercy Park Hotel. He held both roles until a full bartender's position opened up at PDT later that year.\n\n\"There's an awful lot of pressure. When you're working in a top bar like PDT, everyone wants you to mess up.\" But, he adds, \"you just stick to your guns and if you belong on top, you'll impress people. There'll always be haters, but it comes with the territory.\"\n\nIs it that bad? \"It's terrible,\" he winks. Oh please, don't tell us that.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore sales, which accounted for 67 per cent of group sales, registered a 2.9 per cent decrease in Q3 compared to a year ago, due to lower digital and electrical product sales. The fall was due to weaker consumer demand and lower bulk sales.\n\nOn the other hand, Malaysian sales, which contributed 33 per cent of the group's sales, grew by 20.8 per cent. Strong growth was mainly attributable to higher credit sales from an aggressive campaign and higher furniture and electrical product sales. The opening of new stores during the financial year also contributed to the increase in sales.\n\nGross profit rose 12.8 per cent, while gross profit margin increased 2.5 percentage points to 32.1 per cent, backed by higher service charge income from higher credit sales in Malaysia.\n\nFor the nine months to end-December, Courts reported a 28.8 per cent drop in net profit to $20.47 million from $28.77 million, while turnover rose 3 per cent year on year to $623.31 million from $605.27 million.\n\nEarnings per share were 1.12 cents and 3.66 cents for the third quarter and cumulative three quarters, respectively.\n\nCourts said consumer sentiment in Singapore is expected to remain soft in the next six months, and consumers in Malaysia are expected to remain cautious.\n\nHowever, the group continues to implement a series of measures to cope with a weaker retail environment in Malaysia, including an aggressive campaign to ramp up credit sales. Malaysia's long-term fundamentals remain favourable and Courts continues to execute its expansion plans. The second Courts Megastore in Subang was opened in January.\n\nIn Indonesia, construction work for its first \"Big-Box\" Megastore in Bekasi is on track and the store is expected to open ahead of schedule, by the second quarter of FY14-15. Construction negotiations for the group's second Megastore in BSD City, Serpong, is ongoing and opening is targeted in the second half of FY14-15.\n\nThe counter ended trading unchanged at 57.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dinner only on Sat: 6.30pm to 10.30pm. Closed on Sun\n\nITALIAN restaurants must be the culinary equivalent of the white shirt. They never go out of style; they're your failsafe option when you can't decide what to wear; and there's always room for one more in your closet. But if you want something show-stopping, you'll need to widen your colour scheme.\n\nThat pretty much sums up Gattopardo, which has eschewed the old-world charm of Fort Canning for the conservation chic of Tras Street in a move which seems more physical than conceptual.\n\nNow that it's in the centre of town within convenient reach of an ever-expanding upwardly mobile demographic, it's shed its old persona of \"grill and pizza bar\" in favour of something a little more classy such as \"ristorante di mare\" or seafood restaurant, as a nod to chef Lino Sauro's South Italian roots. The result is a cookie-cutter, three-storey eatery that takes its design cues from the \"stylish shophouse decor\" handbook. There's the obligatory bar on the ground level, and a small seafood display counter with a few seats squeezed into a tight corner.\n\nJust a few feet from the welcome desk, the open kitchen concept hardly seems conducive for a comfortable meal, especially with people traipsing past to get to the main dining room on the second floor. The latter, meanwhile, is business-like with starched white tablecloths, neutral colour scheme and generic upscale feel.\n\nIt's the same with the food - attractively plated, served by staff with the necessary decorum of a high-end restaurant. The menu is naturally seafood-centric, in line with its new name and chef Sauro's emphasis on using only sustainably caught seafood.\n\nLike the decor, the cooking and service are strangely impersonal, like meeting a polite stranger who goes through all the motions expected in a civil conversation - it's all very pleasant but not particularly satisfying.\n\nThen again, the restaurant is only a couple of weeks old and technically in soft-opening stage. But while some restaurants have a knack of endearing themselves to you from the start even with teething problems, Gattopardo's staff need a bit more time to warm up to the idea that service is about hospitality and not just literally bringing food to the table.\n\nEverybody's well-meaning and nice enough, but you can't help thinking that they're more pre-occupied with the physical issues of the restaurant - from a non-working ladies' restroom to the many unfinished touches around the place.\n\nThe cooking doesn't seem to be affected, though, as it's competent albeit not the most inspiring. A starter of Polipo ($36), for one, pairs wide strips of chewy grilled marinated octopus with a salad of shredded celery root and sundried tomatoes.\n\nThe acidic edge of the salad is tempered by the slightly sweet marinade of the octopus, but fails to clock any highs. Capesanti e Ceci ($34), is slightly more enjoyable with two plump Norwegian scallops grilled to an appetising semi-raw bounciness, slicked with a streak of mellow chickpea puree and sauteed broccoli rabe. But at $17 a scallop, your pleasure comes with a caveat.\n\nLeaving us wanting is the Capellini alla Moresca ($36) - a bare handful of angel hair pasta in need of an al dente bite, swirled in a cloud of dried mullet roe dust and a smidgen of uni for a result that is more salty than tasty. Same with the Sicilian noodles Bucatini con le Sarde ($30) - otherwise deliciously chewy hollow pasta tubes tossed in a mixture of fresh sardines, raisins and pine nuts, but with more fruit and nuts than actual sardines.\n\nLess reticent in flavour is the signature Zuppa di Pesce \"Gattopardo\" ($40) - a rich, earthy tomato-based broth with a punchy seafood infusion that compensates for the fresh but bland mussels, shrimp and fish.\n\nAnd while we may forgive the less than crisp-skinned roast pork belly with barely there squid ink sauce and hardly a whisper of coffee and orange jam, we find the $40 price for two bite-sized chunks of pork a little hard to swallow. For that amount, surely a copy of the porker's Spanish passport should be made available for all to see.\n\nGiven its general priciness, the $36 set lunch is a steal in comparison. For that money you get a decent trio of vitello tonnato - thin shavings of boiled veal still slightly pink in the middle and drizzled with savoury sabayon and barely a taste of tuna; simple braised pork belly; and a very acceptable green apple tart. In fact, desserts and baked goods are Gattopardo's strong point, particularly its Tortino di Castagne ($18) with its comforting crumbly tart pastry filled with warm chestnut puree. And don't miss the chewy crisp biscotti that comes at the end of the meal.\n\nTaken at face value, Gattopardo is one of your no-brainer, business crowd-oriented Italian eateries with middle-of-the-road cooking that's perfectly pleasant if not superlative-worthy.

Some 94 per cent of complaints are isolated ones against companies, which have received or will soon receive these warnings from the commission.\n\nAmong companies that have each attracted a clutch of complaints, at least two have been handed down what are considered lenient fines - between $500 and $1,000.\n\nCompanies imposed a fine in this range would have sent out multiple text messages to phone numbers listed in the DNC registry, but would have cooperated with the authorities and reviewed their telemarketing practices after being contacted by the commission.\n\nInvestigations are also underway into what the IDA called a \"recalcitrant organisation\", which could be prosecuted in court and fined up to $10,000 per contravention.\n\nCommission chairman Leong Keng Thai said: \"We expect organisations to comply with the DNC provisions and will not hesitate to take enforcement action against errant organisations.\n\n\"We want to encourage consumers to come forward with information on errant companies.\"\n\nAbout three in 10 of the complaints received so far have been made against private-education providers such as tuition centres.\n\nUnwanted property advertisements and other property-related messages make up about a quarter of the complaints, and messages from banks and finance firms, about 10 per cent.\n\nThese three sectors have drawn the most complaints.\n\nThe commission has also received complaints related to unlicensed money-lending, and has referred these to the police.\n\nIt has also fielded complaints about unwanted calls from foreign companies with no presence in Singapore but which are offering their products and services. The number of this is, however, insignificant.\n\nOrganisations seeking to check the DNC lists also need to register themselves to access this information. The number of registered organisations stands at 1,800, up from 505 as at Jan 2. Collectively, these firms have run checks on more than 55 million phone numbers.\n\nAmong the complaints are some which are deemed invalid. These include complaints from consumers who received unwanted messages before Jan 2, or who had not registered themselves in the DNC Registry.\n\nSome 550,000 phone numbers are on this registry, up nearly 40 per cent from the 394,000 \"unique registrations\" on the list as at Jan 2, when the registry was officially in place.\n\nThe IDA did not offer figures on the impact of the registry so far; it has only been a month. However, it said that anecdotal feedback has been positive.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The past week has been quiet, with most protest sites dotted around Bangkok sparsely attended during the day. \"The number of protesters has gone down significantly, so that's one factor,\" said police chief Adul. \"It makes our job to reclaim the protest areas easier.\"\n\nA Reuters witness said there was no violence as at least 1,000 police officers cleared protesters from a site stretching from the Royal Plaza to the United Nations headquarters. A few of the officers were armed but most carried just batons and shields.\n\nSome protesters hurled abuse but otherwise police met no resistance in a historic area of the capital that includes the prime minister's offices at Government House and the Metropolitan Police headquarters, scenes of violent clashes in November and December.\n\nPolice later said they had recovered firearms, ammunition and drugs from the site, where they removed barriers and tents set up by the protesters.\n\nProtest leaders had urged supporters to come out in force over this weekend, and held \"Love Thailand and Break-up with the Thaksin Regime\" events in Bangkok yesterday, Valentine's Day, which coincided with a Buddhist public holiday.\n\n\"This isn't the first time the government and police have tested the waters. They are going for smaller groups; you could call them softer targets,\" said Boonyakiat Karavekphan, a political analyst at Ramkamhaeng University in Bangkok.\n\nAn election on Feb 2 failed to break the deadlock in Thailand, a country popular with tourists and investors but blighted by eight years of polarisation and turmoil.\n\nProtesters blocked voting in a fifth of constituencies, a result that left Parliament without a quorum to approve a new government and Ms Yingluck's Puea Thai Party limping on as the main party in a caretaker administration with limited powers.\n\nThe deadlock has raised concerns about the long-term impact on an already weakening economy, with the caretaker government unable to approve spending on new infrastructure projects that would have supported growth.Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN leading Swedish chef Bjorn Frantzen comes to town next week, it won't just be a few twee Nordic lingonberries he'll be sprinkling on a plate. He's bringing his entire larder - or at least as much as he can squeeze into his hand luggage.\n\nThe plan is to make sure that diners at his one-night-only gig at Les Amis feel as if they're eating in his eponymous restaurant in Stockholm, says the two Michelin-starred chef. Highlights of his menu will include tartare of reindeer and beef with deep fried moss topped with Swedish caviar and a dusting of - grated reindeer penis.\n\nThough Denmark has traditionally been forging the path for the new Nordic food movement, Sweden has been fiercely keeping pace. But Chef Frantzen, whose restaurant climbed up eight spots to 12th position on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list last year, has largely differentiated himself from the pack by working in subtle Asian influences into his Scandinavian cooking.\n\nA sprinkle of seaweed here, a galangal root macaron there - and if you want to see how the magic all happens, you can even watch a condensed video of how his latest Winter menu was created online, in a practice that has become almost a tradition for the restaurant.\n\nOf his fascination with Asian, largely Japanese, culture, Chef Frantzen, who once likened his food to a Nordic kaiseki, says: \"When I visited Japan for the first time a few years ago, I fell in love with their cuisine and their tradition of food.\n\n\"I find their way of keeping things simple very elegant, and we have many things in common, such as our focus on the produce and tradition of fermenting, pickling and preserving,\" he says.\n\nWhile South-east Asian flavours don't feature on his menu yet, he adds that he hopes to explore the local wet markets on his maiden visit to Singapore.\n\nAcknowledging that the converse phenomenon - an Asian fascination with Nordic cuisine - isn't yet apparent, he believes that Nordic gastronomy is still very new, and will take time to find resonance in Asia. But interest is growing, thanks to awards and lists such as the World's 50 Best, he says. \"The list has definitely helped international guests find us more easily. People who travel for food set our restaurant at the top of their to-do list and I'm sure the list will have the same response in Asia,\" he adds of the list's Asian spin-off, the second edition of which will be revealed in Singapore next weekend.\n\nIt has, after all, helped not just his restaurant, but the Swedish restaurant scene to soar. \"Restaurants are opening every week in Stockholm, guests can pick and choose what they think is best. It's really fun to see Stockholm evolving from a small city to this,\" he says.\n\nTo stay ahead of the game, he's just installed a new test kitchen in the restaurant, for him and his two chefs to \"try out every idea that comes to mind\" in the day. By night, the 20-seater space turns into a room for private dining.\n\nAs for his role in the Nordic food revolution, he says: \"That's a hard one. This question is easier to answer looking back. Please get back to me when I retire.\"\n\nThree Michelin stars, perhaps? \"No pressure,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But, as widely expected, the number fell short of the US$200 billion or so seen at the Dubai Airshow last November, where the Gulf carriers Emirates, Etihad and Qatar placed massive orders for next-generation aircraft.\n\nThe biggest deal this week in Singapore came from Ireland-based leasing company Amedeo, formerly Doric Lease Corp, which firmed up an order for 20 Airbus A380 double-decker jets worth US$8.3 billion. Airbus also finalised an order with VietJetAir for 63 A320 family aircraft to the tune of US$6.4 billion as the budget carrier prepares to expand at home and in the region.\n\nBoeing announced that Thai low-cost carrier Nok Air would buy 15 single-aisle 737s, comprising eight Boeing 737-800s and seven of the upcoming 737 MAX 8s, worth US$1.45 billion.\n\nBombardier inked firm orders and commitments for up to 17 aircraft totalling US$852 million, while Pratt & Whitney signed a 10-year fleet management agreement with Malaysia Airlines for its fleet of 43 PW4170 engines worth US$550 million.\n\nAnd an order on Thursday from Indian start-up airline Air Costa for 50 of Embraer's E2 aircraft worth US$2.94 billion - with purchase rights for another 50 - helped boost the tally.\n\nEven with emerging economies such as India and Indonesia grappling with weaker currencies in recent months, aircraft makers such as Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier this week downplayed concerns that the region might have more planes on order than it can absorb, pointing to rising passenger traffic and the need for newer, more fuel-efficient models, given stubbornly high fuel prices.\n\n\"(Demand) for smaller aircraft to ply domestic routes for the Indonesian market, India and even Thailand and Malaysia - I think that will trend up,\" said Mr Lau at a press conference yesterday. \"There will be a fair bit of replacement of aircraft over the next few years. The MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) business will continue to flourish, as well as the growth for aviation training and the simulation market.\"\n\nSingapore Airlines and Airbus, for instance, said this week that they would set up an $80 million flight training centre to cater to regional airlines.\n\nHeld at the Changi Exhibition Centre (CEC), the Singapore Airshow (Feb 11-16) attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors from the commercial and defence industries, and 279 delegations from 72 countries.\n\nThis year's edition also saw slightly more trade visitors, at over 40,000 from 125 countries during the first three trade days - compared with around 38,000 in 2012 - of which roughly a third were from overseas.\n\nHighlights from the static display area this year included Airbus's upcoming A350 wide-body jet (which was pulled out of test flights to perform a flying demonstration here), Qatar's Dreamliner as well as business jets and military aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey. Some of these planes have already departed, with about 50 to be left on display when the Airshow is open to the public this weekend. Some 80,000 public visitors are expected to attend, with most of the tickets already sold yesterday.\n\nAirbus's spokesman for Asia, Sean Lee, said: \"In addition to presenting the A350 for the first time, we announced orders valued at almost US$15 billion. We were also pleased with the quality of visitors to the show, which included senior airline management representatives from across the region.\"\n\n\"It's a great venue. We've always been able to show the products very well here,\" said Roger Sperry, regional senior vice-president (sales) of Gulfstream, which brought its entire fleet of private jets. \"It's a good place for people to do comparisons of the various models.\"\n\nThe biggest of 16 Airshows in Asia, the Singapore Airshow serves as a networking platform for firms, industry leaders and high-level government officials in the sector's fastest-growing region.\n\nExperia Events said 72 per cent of the exhibitors from this year's Airshow had confirmed they will return in two years for the biennial event (Feb 16-21, 2016), with some pledging to take up more exhibition space.\n\nThe organiser is working with various government agencies to attract more firms from Asia, such as SMEs.\n\nMore than 1,000 meetings took place over the trade days, which could be the foundation for orders that might be sealed down the road.\n\nAt home, the Airshow generates economic spin-offs as well. A 2012 study showed more than US$250 million in spending going towards the economy.\n\nIn coming years, as Changi Airport expands to incorporate Terminal 5, the event organiser will need to look into how construction will affect accessibility to the CEC.\n\n\"What we will probably need to do is work with the authorities on accessing Aviation Park Road,\" said Mr Lau, referring to editions of the Singapore Airshow that will come after 2016.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

PT Indofood garnered majority control quickly, aided by the shortseller-inspired crash that prompted traumatised shareholders to sell their stakes on the market.\n\nAs of Nov 6 last year, Indofood had an 82.9 per cent stake in China Minzhong, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile the company expects consumption demand for its products to stay healthy, it noted that the Chinese government's urbanisation programme has led to a shortage of farmers and rising labour costs.\n\nIt has since expanded into industrialised farming for higher productivity and cost efficiency and to be able to harvest all year round without weather disruption, it said.\n\nIts counter rose 4 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to close at $0.955.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The five-day gain was 25 points or 0.8 per cent to 3,038.71, with the index slipping 1.19 points yesterday during which 1.8 billion units worth $872 million were traded.\n\nOn Tuesday, volume done of $792 million - of which $450 million or 57 per cent was done in the 30 STI components - was the lowest daily total for the year so far.\n\nThe rebound after several days of selling in January came after Wall Street, which itself came under tremendous pressure last month on worries over the health of the Chinese and US economies, managed to stabilise and recover almost all its losses.\n\nReasons for the US recovery, however, are not readily obvious. Economic releases have been mixed - the January employment and retail sales numbers have been weak but this has been attributed to bad weather - and the new Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has not said anything new other than reiterate the already known fact that the Fed under her stewardship will continue along lines set by her predecessor, Ben Bernanke.\n\nConventional wisdom, though, is still that the US economy is recovering and that Fed tapering will end at the end of this year, and that the first interest rate hike will occur only next year.\n\nIn its assessment of Ms Yellen's testimony to Congress this week, Ideaglobal said she appears to be unveiling a moderate revision to forward guidance, with more labour market indicators being used to judge whether the labour market is tightening.\n\n\"This fits with the broader guidance that the Fed Funds rate is unlikely to rise until well into 2015, despite the prospect of ongoing Fed tapering,\" said Ideaglobal. Ms Yellen was also due to testify this week to the Senate Banking Committee but that was postponed because of bad weather.\n\nAmong the blue chips to release its results this week was land transport operator ComfortDelgro (CD), which reported a 5.7 per cent increase in net profit to $263.2 million and recommended a final dividend of four cents per share.\n\nIn its \"buy\" on ComfortDelgo, OCBC Investment Research said it has reworked its assumptions following a change in analyst coverage, and raises its dividend-discount fair value from $2.20 to $2.30.\n\n\"We are positive on the fact that management has been able to mitigate domestic challenges by making astute accretive overseas acquisitions,\" said the broker.\n\nOSK DMG, in the meantime, also called a \"buy\" on CD with a fair value of $2.22 derived from a discounted cash flow model, but added that this has been reduced because it expects CD's local operating conditions to remain challenging. CD's shares yesterday closed unchanged at $1.94 with four million traded.\n\nIn the penny segment, Ocean Sky International (OSI) stood out, not because its share price rose but because it fell sharply. The civil engineering company was to be taken over by offshore marine company Ezion Holdings in a deal announced last September but that deal has been aborted.\n\nIn a Wednesday release, Ezion said the Singapore Exchange (SGX) had informed the company that the deal amounted to a reverse takeover, and because this would result in \"protracted timings\", the parties did not wish to extend the transactions and had decided not to proceed.\n\nOSI's shares yesterday managed a 1.4-cent bounce to 14.3 cents with 70.4 million done but are still 15.2 cents or 52 per cent down for the week.\n\nOther active low-priced issues were familiar names, such as HanKore, Charisma Energy, Albedo and SingHaiyi. Ezion's shares gained one cent over the week to $2.29.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After a two-year hiatus as the head chef of modernist restaurant Keystone, which closed last year, Mark Richards has resurfaced on the local culinary radar. This time, he's heading things up at five-month-old Marina Square eatery, Nuvo, and his first task at hand: to give the menu a spiffy reboot.\n\nGone are the heavy pastas created by the restaurant's outgoing Japanese head chef, and in their place, lighter plates bearing mixed heritage - as though an Italian married a Japanese and bore local school-enrolled, Singlish-speaking children.\n\nThe Angel Hair Wakame ($18/24) is an Italian capellini sprinkled with Japanese seaweed and tossed in chilli oil like you would a bak chor mee. The Green tea Pan di Spagna ($12) is a matcha cake with the moist density of a nonya kueh, and is served topped with a comforting banana jam and a crumble of Hello Panda (yes, the chocolate biscuit you may still remember from your childhood). Likewise the Ricotta Cheesecake ($15), which bears a characteristically Japanese melt-in-your-mouth lightness and is served spiked with chocolate Pocky sticks.\n\n\"I've missed the kitchen - all the buzz and the noise in it. That was what drove my decision to return to the motherland,\" says the 38-year-old Eurasian chef, who spent his break consulting on restaurant projects in China, Mongolia and Russia. \"Plus, I really liked the concept. Singaporeans are crazy about their Japanese food and their Italian food, so it's a no-brainer to come up with a menu that brings together both cuisines.\"\n\nOn his obsession with scientific cooking techniques - about 90 per cent of his dishes are sous vide, including the risotto - Mr Richards says it's something he picked up while working in Hawaii in 2003, and he hasn't looked back since. \"It's a practical way of cooking, it gives a better, consistent result by eliminating human error, and you are giving more justice to the produce,\" he explains. \"But at the end of the day, the base has to be in classical cooking, and then we evolve the food from there.\"\n\nFans of his bold, experimental strokes at Keystone, however, should be prepared to find a more restrained hand at Nuvo.\n\nInstead of pureeing and dehydrating fresh squid into squid ink crackers as he would have done at Keystone, for example, they are deep-fried as crowd-pleasing calamari rings and served on a bed of rocket leaves with compressed watermelon. \"As a mall restaurant, our food has to be easily relatable to everyone. I don't want to scare the aunties and uncles away,\" he laughs.\n\nStill, to please the most ardent of his followers, Mr Richards can design degustation menus for 10 diners and above with a fortnight's notice. The 150-seater restaurant's cocktail lounge will double as a swish private dining area after its refurbishment later this month.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Among those are rules that could impose a minimum share price on Mainboard-listed companies.\n\nSeparate from the public consultation, SGX will also change its querying framework from March 3, allowing the market operator to issue a \"Trade with caution\" note for queried companies who cannot explain unusual trading in their shares.\n\nThe BT analysis sought to assess what the proposed changes could mean if they were applied to Singapore-listed companies right now.\n\nFor the minimum share price proposal, the possible impact was assessed for different minimum prices, from five cents to 30 cents. MAS and SGX have set initial guidance at 10 to 20 cents.\n\nThe analysis showed that as many as 337, or 43.3 per cent, of all the listed companies could be affected if the minimum share price was set at 30 cents.\n\nThe question was then asked, what do those affected companies contribute to the market?\n\nIn terms of market turnover, the impact appears to be small, ranging from 0.5 per cent to 6.1 per cent of total traded value for minimum share prices from 5-30 cents.\n\nIn terms of volatility, while the affected companies tend to have higher-than-average volatility, the dampening benefits of a minimum price appear to diminish with higher price hurdles.\n\nAt a minimum of five cents, the affected stocks would have average 30-day volatility of 113.6 per cent compared to the market mean of 64.7 per cent. At 30 cents, the affected stocks' volatility would average about 75.6 per cent.\n\nIn terms of trading queries, BT classified all the replies to trading queries over the past year into five categories: Not aware; always looking at deals; could be explained by a previous announcement; insider trades that have yet to be announced; and specific but undisclosed potential deals.\n\nAbout 64 per cent of the replies made did not give specific reasons to explain their share prices, saying that they were not aware of any pertinent undisclosed information or that they were always looking at deals. Those will probably receive \"Trade with caution\" notices under the new regime.\n\nThe analysis is not perfect.\n\nConstraints in obtaining data limited the analysis to closing prices over the two-week period to Feb 12, when the consult suggests that volume-weighted price will be observed over a 180-day period. The universe of stocks also differs depending on the source of the data. The BT analysis used SGX's end-of-day numbers and excluded depository receipts, derivatives and exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe BT analysis deviates slightly from official data, which were also limited because they were current only until Dec 31 and only showed the impact of minimum share prices of 10 and 20 cents.\n\nMAS data showed that with the minimum share price set at 10 cents, 22 per cent of Mainboard-listed companies could be affected. BT's analysis was 25 per cent. Those companies had average volatility of 123.6 per cent, according to MAS. BT's analysis had volatility of 94 per cent.\n\nWith a minimum share price of 20 cents, MAS data showed 38 per cent of Mainboard-listed companies affected, compared to 42 per cent for BT. Average volatility for the MAS stocks was 100.7 per cent, compared to 83.1 per cent for BT.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net property income was 805.87 million yen, 2.4 per cent higher than the IPO forecast.\n\nThe main positive variance was from property management expenses. This was offset by increased sales and promotion expenses at suburban shopping centre Mallage Shobu. However, overall property expenses were lower than forecast by 0.8 per cent.\n\nIncome available for distribution was 713 million yen (S$8.8 million), which is 6 per cent higher than the IPO forecast. The higher income available for distribution was mainly due to property tax rebates. This was offset by the difference between the actual and forecasted distribution hedge rate for the period.\n\nFor H1 FY2014, distribution per unit is 5.24 cents, and income available for distribution is 1.85 billion yen. The net property income is 2.08 billion yen, and gross revenue is 3.29 billion yen.\n\nThis is CRT's first distribution and it will be paid on March 31, 2014.\n\nJim Chang, chief executive officer and executive director of Croesus Retail Asset Management, the trustee-manager of CRT, said: \"Across 1H FY2014, we are seeing a healthy level of consumer activity at our properties as well as encouraging macroeconomic indicators that point to growing optimism and confidence in the Japanese economy. We are in a good place to benefit from these economic conditions given our close to 100 per cent occupancy rates and stable rents across CRT's four retail assets.\"\n\nThe company also said that its properties are expected to continue generating stable cash flows and that it is expected to meet its IPO forecast for the period ending June 30, 2014.\n\nCRT's counter closed up 2.5 cents at 91.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite recent uncertainties in a few countries, we remain positive on Asia's underlying economic fundamentals,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank, the smallest of the three by market capitalisation, had the best performance. It recorded a 11.1 per cent increase in Q4 net profit to $773 million, led by strong growth in core income streams.\n\nUOB also rewarded shareholders with a special dividend of five cents; raising the total payout for the year to 75 cents, up from 70 cents in 2012. DBS Group Holdings and OCBC Bank raised their final dividends, by two cents and one cent, respectively.\n\nDBS core net profit in Q4 rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $802 million on a 10 per cent gain in total income. Including one-off items, DBS' Q4 net fell 20 per cent to $973 million. OCBC's net profit of $715 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 8 per cent higher.\n\nFor the full-year 2013, net profit of the three was a combined $9.45 billion, down from $10.6 billion in 2012 which had hefty $1.65 billion one-off gains.\n\nThe banks enjoyed strong loans growth of 17-18 per cent, fuelled by increases in business lending particularly from trade loans to China. Net interest margin or the profit made from loans continues to hold steady.\n\nDBS said its loans increased 18 per cent or $38 billion to $249 billion, led by regional trade loans, Singapore corporate borrowing and secured consumer loans.\n\nCustomer loans at OCBC rose 18 per cent to $170 billion from broad-based growth in Singapore and key overseas markets, which was led by trade finance and loans to the housing and building & construction sectors.\n\nUOB said loans from Singapore increased 17.7 per cent to $119 billion while those from regional countries grew 16.8 per cent to $52.7 billion (excluding currency impact).\n\nLoans growth this year is expected to ease off, falling to low double digits as the impact of stricter loan rules on mortgages bites hard.\n\nNew mortgage applications have fallen as much as 40-50 per cent, said OCBC chief operating officer Ching Wei Hong.\n\n\"We've seen volumes come off 40-50 per cent. That's expected given all the cooling measures that were imposed,\" he said.\n\nBut the banks said the slower home sales which have seen prices falling and a possible hike in interest rates are not likely to hit earnings negatively unless people start losing jobs.\n\nUOB chief financial officer Lee Wai Fai said the bank is less worried about increase in interest rates than unemployment.\n\n\"We have stressed (tested) interest rates through various forms ... and probably we felt that we can take easily 4 to 5 per cent increase in interest rate (hike) shock,\" said Mr Lee.\n\n\"For that to happen overnight, I think that will take a drastic attack on the currencies ... it's unlikely going to happen. So this worry about interest rates or default on non-performing loans (NPLs), if it ever happens in the mortgage market, will take some years to pan out.\n\n\"We saw that in the last crisis. Normally NPLs take three to four years to pan out, which will give a commercial bank like us time to react.\"\n\n\"So far, like I said, we've been monitoring that, the government is already ahead of the game. We ourselves are stressing that through various scenarios, and unemployment is something that we watch very, very closely,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/raise-lantern", "site_title": "Raise the lantern", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRaise the lantern\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nYeo Swee Huat Paper Agency\n\nBlk 6, Lor 8, #01-1307, Toa Payoh Industrial Park\n\nMOST artists paint on canvas, but not Yeo Hung Teo. He paints on lanterns, and is one of the rare few in Singapore who do this.\n\nThe 75-year-old runs Yeo Swee Huat Paper Agency, which was started by his late father. At 16, the younger Mr Yeo left school and joined the company, which produces traditional Teochew lanterns, and paper paraphernalia used in temples and for funerals.\n\nIn the past, Teochew families who could afford it would hang lanterns outside their homes. Each lantern would bear the family surname, and the location of their village in China. Besides families, temples, such as the Yueh Hai Ching Temple in Philip Street and clan associations, would also hang such lanterns, which often have auspicious characters written on them.\n\n\"These days, there are only a handful of families who hang these lanterns,\" says Mr Yeo, adding that it is only the Teochews who have such a tradition.\n\nMaking a lantern is a tedious chore, says Mr Yeo. Each lantern comes with a lattice bamboo frame, which is imported from China. Strips of cloth, or translucent paper, the same kind used in making Japanese shoji doors, are then stuck on the bamboo frame, using a special glue made from seaweed. Mr Yeo still follows the same traditional methods.\n\n\"Using glue from seaweed gives a better finish compared to glue made from flour,\" he says in Mandarin. Mr Yeo has staff to prepare the lantern, but he does the painting himself. \"I studied art, and I've always had a strong interest in drawing and painting from young,\" he says. Apart from flowers, such as peonies and lotus, Mr Yeo also draws mythical creatures such as the phoenix and dragon. He learnt to draw on his own, when he first joined the company. He uses a pen to draw on the lanterns before using acrylic paint, sometimes in neon shades to colour in the lines. It is not hard to see that Mr Yeo has decades of experience, as the creatures look very life-like.\n\nLanterns all have words on them, which Mr Yeo also personally paints. He says he is a stickler for details and quality, and never does a rushed job on them. Each stroke is given at least seven coats of paint, to get a smooth and consistent finish, and to make them look more outstanding when the lantern is illuminated. \"Some others do fewer coats, and you can spot the inconsistency,\" says Mr Yeo.\n\nBy sticking to his well-tested methods of production, Mr Yeo says his lanterns can last about a decade. Worn out lanterns are brought back to Mr Yeo, who strips off the covering, and reuses the bamboo frames.\n\n\"Our busy time is usually in December, when customers want a new set of lanterns for the new year,\" he says. Each lantern can take about two weeks to produce, and cost from $500 for a pair.\n\nMr Yeo knows that the younger generation has little interest in doing what he does. He has taught some university students the art of painting, but \"you really need to have the patience and passion to stay in this\", he says. He has no plans to retire.\n\nOver the years, he's become known as the expert for painting dragons. But ask him what's the hardest to paint, and he says it is the tiger. \"A tiger must be fierce. If you don't paint it well, it can turn out to be a pussy cat,\" he quips.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But planned deliveries this year and the next will fall to 36 and 21 aircraft, respectively.\n\nMr Garrison said Bell will build more advanced and reliable helicopters, and leverage on strong service and maintenance support to differentiate itself and grow market share in the commercial helicopters sector.\n\n\"We've captured more of the market in 2012 and 2013,\" he said. \"So we've enhanced our position in the marketplace.\"\n\nGlobally, commercial sales for Bell grew 13 per cent last year in a challenging market, he added.\n\nThe company has \"a very active engineering and development programme\", and is developing two new commercial helicopters scheduled for their first flights this year.\n\nOne is the five-seater Short Light Single (SLS) first announced last year in Paris, which will be unveiled at Heli-Expo 2014 in two weeks' time. The second is the larger Bell 525 Relentless that takes 16 passengers. It will be the first commercial helicopter to feature fly-by- wire.\n\nOn the military side, the company is developing the V-280 Valor, a third-generation tilt-rotor aircraft, as part of the US Air Force's search for a replacement of Apaches and Black Hawks.\n\nThe V-22 Osprey, on display for the first time at the Singapore Airshow, has received tremendous attention here, Mr Garrison said.\n\nWith reduced production for the US government, he said there is capacity available from Bell and Boeing for foreign governments, too. \"There's no doubt the speed, capability and range of the aircraft are ideally suited for this region.\"\n\nIn Singapore, Bell's capabilities at its 165,000 square foot Seletar facility, shared with Cessna, have continued to grow.\n\nSaid Mr Garrison: \"We are able to offer new (engineer) training, some training solutions, and we have received certification from Transport Canada to do some maintenance and customisation work.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their aim: to present inexpensive, off-cuts of meat in unexpectedly delicious ways.\n\nA platter of beef short ribs ($34) is cooked sous vide for 24-hours to accentuate its tender marbling; a slab of pork cheek ($28) is dusted with a panko crust and served on a bed of pea and horseradish puree.\n\nIf it all sounds a tad Fergus Henderson to you, it actually is. For Cordon Bleu-trained Mr Leong admits to being enamoured of the nose-to-tail cooking philosophy, though not quite taking it to the extreme as Mr Henderson's St John's restaurant does.\n\nSo while you won't find any lungs or intestines on the menu at Dibs, neither will you get prime sirloin or tenderloin. It's not all bottom-of-the-barrel picks, either: the short ribs are from Black Angus cattle while the cheeks are from black pigs (kurobuta).\n\nBut the best part of the menu at Dibs is how the Asian elements play out in subtle, creative ways, such as a drizzle of fish sauce or gula melaka in the salad dressing, or a chicken roll with ginger, burnt rice and cucmber ($25) that's like a modern take on chicken rice. A starter of \"meat butter\", or bone marrow ($15), is laced with teriyaki sauce and bonito flakes for that extra umami and the bowl of smokey cockles ($8) is adapted from the favourite beer snack of kopitiam uncles, but dressed up with bacon dashi and a lively kick of smoked chillis.\n\nThe benefits of running a small restaurant is that new dishes are always being tinkered with, and the menu will evolve gradually, says Mr Leong, who previously worked at Italian restaurant Gaia at the Goodwood Park Hotel and Quest, a molecular Asian restaurant in Abu Dhabi. His two other partners, Jonathan Wee and Lawrence Lim, work in the finance and start-up industries respectively.\n\nThe restaurant currently seats 40 on the first floor, while a soon-to-open lofty second floor is used as a private events space for now. The trio also hope to open a second concept when things stabilise, such as a winebar offering homemade charcuterie, says Mr Leong.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With fixed costs such as depreciation and amortisation as well as taxes to remain constant, \"we expect (that) as volumes and Ebitda kick in for the second half, you'll see potential for earnings growth.\"\n\nOlam also made strides in its cashflow metrics.\n\nFree cash flow to firm (FCFF) improved from negative $777.2 million to negative $282.2 million, while free cash flow to equity (FCFE) - which includes interest the firm has paid - went from negative $988.1 million to negative $533.5 million.\n\nThe firm is on track to becoming FCFF-positive by the end of the financial year, said Mr Shekhar, \"and we're focused on ensuring that happens while we're growing our earnings as well as our Ebitda\".\n\nFor the first half of this year, Olam moderated the pace of its capital expenditure, shaving it to $262.4 million, from $469.6 million last year.\n\nOlam's negative free cashflow and high capital expenditure had attracted criticism from US shortselling firm Muddy Waters in November 2012. Subsequent to the saga, Olam in April last year unveiled a new strategy to accelerate free cash flow generation, reduce gearing and complexity in the business, as well as to promote a better understanding of its business.\n\nOlam's gearing now stands at 2.06 times, compared with 2.21 times in the first half of last year.\n\nThe 10 initiatives that Olam has undertaken through sale and leaseback transactions and divestments, among others, will release about $446.5 million in cash for the current financial year, the firm said yesterday, adding that it is still in discussions for more of such transactions.\n\nOCBC Investment Research yesterday increased its earnings forecast for Olam, and upgraded its call on the firm to \"buy\" on the better-than-expected set of results.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By David Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAS the saying goes, you are what you eat. But few take it quite as seriously as the folks in Chaoshan, where no conversation can begin without a cup of Gongfu tea, a social etiquette strictly adhered to since the Song Dynasty. The brewing of tea is itself a ceremonial ritual, and often, guests get to sample the best pick of the host's tea collection.\n\nThe Teochews - as the natives of Chaoshan are called - guard their history and culture so fiercely that even as other Chinese cities rushed to embrace the modern new lifestyles that economic growth brought, the Teochews paced themselves. Although Shantou was one of the four original Special Economic Zones, the city didn't develop as fast as Shenzhen, Xiamen and Zhuhai.\n\nShantou is part of Chaoshan, itself a prefecture of Guangdong Province together with Chaozhou and Jieyang. With a population of three million, this former fishing village is today a major toy-manufacturing centre in South-east China. As with many fast-growing cities in China, there is a sharp contrast of old and new, and modern high-rise buildings and old shophouses mingle cheek-by-jowl. Navigating the streets is easy, but be prepared for big city hassles such as bargaining with the taxi drivers (slashing taxi fares by as much as 40 per cent is possible!)\n\nEven the food in Shantou has undergone some changes. While the majority of the residents prefer traditional food, the young have been seduced by Western and foreign cuisines. Journalist/author Zhang Xinming, an expert on Teochew cuisine, explains: \"It is impossible to resist the changing of taste buds. The world has evolved, and people are exposed to new concepts and ingredients through various media.\"\n\nTogether with some friends, Mr Zhang recently set up Chao Cai Yanjiu Hui, a resource centre to promote Teochew cuisine within the prefecture as well as overseas. \"It's a place to promote and exchange information about our cuisine and heritage,\" says Mr Zhang. \"We even have a kitchen for training young chefs in both cooking techniques and plating.\"\n\nMost Singaporeans strolling the stall-lined streets of Shantou will find the food familiar, even if the taste isn't what we're used to. Which is to be expected, considering that the recipes that the early immigrants prepared in Singapore have been modified over the generations. For instance, we eat our kway chap steamed while Shantou residents would pan-fry the rice sheets to give them a light crust. Even the broth is slightly starchier.\n\nSupper is a compulsory ritual here - a full-blown version of Teochew porridge. Instead of boneless braised duck, though, the Teochews jostle for the more esoteric goose head. In fact, it appears at almost every meal as appetizer, with the Teochews being so finicky about it that a special breed of goose, known as Lion's Head Goose or Shi Tou E, is farmed for its head and liver only. Each head, after braising, weighs about 2kg, and costs as much as S$200 at a fine-dining restaurant.\n\nAn hour's drive from Shantou lies Chaozhou - Chaoshan's most famous historical and cultural city. For centuries, it was a rich arts hub known for its prowess in opera, music, tea drinking, lion dance and of course, cuisine.\n\nThe history of Chaozhou could be traced back more than 5,000 years. Many archaeological sites have been unearthed, including many Buddhist relics, and Ming Period architectural ruins are found within the city. Most social gatherings are still held at the local teahouses, accompanied by string ensembles, and in the north lies the famous mountain known for its Wu'long Chinese tea.\n\nDriving into town, you can't miss the many porcelain shops with huge signboards. For more than 1,300 years, Chaozhou was a major porcelain-manufacturing centre; in recent years, it has also become a leading manufacturer of apparel, electronics and foodstuffs.\n\nHowever, it is the rich cuisine of the city that attracts food connoisseurs. The Teochews are famed for their deft handling of seafood, in particular their skill at extracting the best flavours with various cooking methods, including some very simple ones. It is common to find fish, prawn or crab served raw, at most accompanied by a sauce, or cured with soy sauce. On the other hand, delicacies such as shark's fins, abalone and sea cucumber are often elaborately prepared for lavish dinners.\n\nPuning, within Jieyang, is a relatively new county formed in the Ming dynasty. Most of the ancestors of the current 2.3 million residents of Puning were immigrants from Putian during the tumultuous period of the Song dynasty. It was under the Ming however, that the city became fully developed as a centre for agriculture and Chinese medicinal herbs.\n\nPuning boasts a relatively small town centre, which resembles Singapore in the 80s. Outside this can be found many Ming-style villages that lie around the city. Although the buildings suffer from a lack of proper maintenance, the famed Teochew style of mosaic porcelain-work known as chien nien, or cut-and-paste porcelain, still form magnificent elaborate motifs along the roofs and archways.\n\nLife in this city is laid-back, and many traditional foods can still be found along the roads and at makeshift stalls in the villages. Many traditional, artisanal businesses still exist, such as a three-generation-old noodle shop whose recipes have remained unchanged for more than 100 years. Everything, including the noodles, is still made from scratch each day. At another stall a husband and wife would arrange simple wooden boxes and stools to sell deep-fried ngoh hiang (five-spice meat roll).\n\nPuning is home to the famous Puning miso sauce and tofu. Its makers treat the simple task of deep-frying tofu as seriously as studying for a university degree. Each family has its own recipe and method of achieving the crispy yet moist tofu, and little else. For them, and the people of the region, ensuring that they put simple, but fine-tasting and fortifying food on the table for family and friends is all that truly matters.\n\nOne can easily fly directly to Shantou from Singapore. For those who would like a holiday detour from Guangzhou, Shantou is only an hour's train ride with the newly launched express train.\n\nADDRESSES\n\nSHANTOU\n\nZhuang Shi Xiang Ji\n\nZhongshan Lu\n\nNo 2 Guo Rui Jian Cai Jie Ju Zhong Xin\n\nTel 0754 88360111\n\nA private-room only Teochew buffet restaurant.

Fixed income makes up a major portion of Asian portfolios, said Mr Dunnett.\n\n\"Asia-based investors, a lot have global bond mandates, are splitting them because 60 per cent are US bonds,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nUS bonds were affected by the tapering fears last year and returns were negative, he said. Worries last summer that the US Federal Reserve would soon start shrinking its money stimulus programme roiled financial markets. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasuries went from 1.6 per cent in February last year to a high of 3.0 per cent at the end of the year. It has since fallen to about 2.8 per cent. Bond prices fall when yields rise.\n\nInvestors are increasingly shifting some of the bond allocations to euro fixed income. So far this year, investment grade euro bonds have returned 1.4 per cent, he said.\n\nMr Dunnett is projecting returns of 2.75 to 3.25 per cent for this year while he expects the returns for US bonds to remain negative because of further tapering measures and expectations that interest rates will rise.\n\nThe new Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen has this week committed to continue scaling back asset purchases given the firmer US economy.\n\n\"If incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labour market conditions and inflation moving back towards its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps,\" said Ms Yellen.\n\nInterest rates will rise and it will hit the US harder as the economy is more robust, Mr Dunnett said. On the other hand, the euro sovereign crisis has \"not completely normalised\". The euro fixed income market is a growing asset class, he said.\n\nThe euro investment grade credit market has grown 3.8 times since the beginning of 2000 to reach 1.55 trillion euros (S$2.7 trillion). This compares to US$4.6 trillion for the US investment grade credit market which dates back to 1860.\n\nThe smaller size is partly reflected in the fact that European corporates have traditionally found funding via bank loans; this is expected to change going forward as banks deleverage, he said.\n\nEuropean banks will continue to deleverage, and corporates will increasingly find financing on the credit markets. This is especially true for corporates in peripheral countries who rely on banks for a large proportion of their financing. This will force them to improve their credit profile to avoid high borrowing costs, Mr Dunnett said.\n\nAs for euro exposure concerns given that Asian investors are largely in US dollars, Mr Dunnett said that, for years, people have said that the euro will fall against the greenback. \"But it's held very strongly,\" he said.\n\nThat's because the European Central Bank does not do quantitative easing like the US. \"The ECB does not print money,\" he said.\n\nIn January 2011, one euro was worth US$1.31, now it's about US$1.36.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They gained 11.5 per cent in December from a year earlier, the fastest annual growth since 2002, according to the RP Data-Rismark Home Value Index. Meriton, which had been debt free since 2000, took out a loan in early 2013 to fund new developments as it held on to more of the apartments it built to capitalise on rental demand.\n\nMr Triguboff, who turns 81 next month, is Australia's fourth-richest individual with a net worth of US$5.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nMeriton, based in Sydney, owns or manages more than 3,000 apartments as long-term accommodation, and rents out 3,200 serviced units, according to the company. It owns enough land to build about 11,000 apartments, up from a traditional pipeline of about 8,000, Mr Triguboff said. About 1,500 of those will be built this year, he added.\n\nApartments in suburbs close to city centres will be the most popular type of new developments after houses in the same locations over the next 12 months, a survey of about 290 property professionals by National Australia Bankon Wednesday showed. Apartments valued at less than A$1 million have the best prospects for capital gains this year, the survey showed.\n\nMeriton sells between 12 per cent and 15 per cent of its apartments to overseas buyers, most of them Chinese, according to the company. It doesn't market the properties in mainland China and has no plans to start, Mr Triguboff, the Chinese-born son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, said.\n\n\"They come to me,\" he said. \"Today, we're part of the Chinese market, more than 10,000 apartments is nothing,\" he said, referring to how many units the company can build.\n\nMeriton, which has focused on Sydney in New South Wales state, and Brisbane and the Gold Coast in Queensland, is venturing into Melbourne in Victoria for the first time, seeking existing buildings and development sites in the city's centre for serviced apartments, Mr Triguboff said.\n\nIn Sydney, Meriton is open to acquiring commercial properties in \"top locations\", such as overlooking Hyde Park in the city centre, for conversion to apartments, he said.\n\nMeriton continues to receive interest from global investors to take over the company, Mr Triguboff said. Last year, he said that he had been approached by bankers representing pension funds from Canada and the UK, and Chinese funds.\n\n\"We have interest all the time, but they don't give me enough,\" he said, adding that the company is worth A$6.1 billion.\n\nIf the price is right \"I might sell\", he said. \"But I now have a grandson who's started. If he'll be OK, maybe we'll keep it.\" Mr Triguboff's grandson began working at Meriton last month, he said. His first great grandchild, born to granddaughter and Meriton's marketing director Ella Lizor this year, could also be a potential successor, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Seat-mile cost will be almost similar, allowing a higher flight frequency with the right size.\n\nHe added that E-Jets will help complement larger narrow-body planes such as the Boeing 737s.\n\n\"I think the first major low-cost airline in this region that gets into the E-Jets and E2 will be a winner in the game,\" he said.\n\nAround 65 operators worldwide currently fly E-Jets. \"The target is to have 100 airlines by the time of the E2,\" Mr Dunnachie said.\n\nHe added that after sales support is also one of Embraer's greatest strengths, helping it differentiate itself. \"We always remind the market that our support network is at least 20 years of blood, sweat and tears.\"\n\nEmbraer has been in Singapore for 13 years, with a warehouse in Changi, and is actively looking at new facilities here.\n\nThe company is scouting locations for a new simulator to add to those in Australia and Japan. \"Logically that should be here, in the centre,\" Mr Dunnachie said, but added that there are no firm plans yet.\n\n\"We've had a very prolonged association with Singapore, and I can only see that expanding in the future.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will enable consumers to lock in their electricity prices as far as two years down the road.\n\nWhile the dates are subject to final approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, \"we think we are on time\", the official added. Speaking at a Seraya Energy forum organised by the genco for its customers, Matthias Obert, SGX vice-president and its director of commodities, said the futures market here will provide new options for consumers to procure and hedge electricity. \"It helps cancel the short-term fluctuations in the spot market\", when prices can fluctuate widely.\n\nThis was seen in the electricity price spikes last year, when prices doubled during the haze period, and when there was a tight supply cushion, including from a forced generation outage. Therefore, futures are a cost-efficient way of fixing electricity prices.\n\nThe latest SGX timeline tallies with what S Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, said at the Singapore International Energy Week last October, that the Republic intended to launch the electricity futures market in the second half of 2014 after a market trial.\n\nAt that time, Mr Iswaran, who is also the Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade & Industry, revealed that six gencos had indicated their interest to be market makers. They comprise the three biggest players here, Senoko Energy, YTL PowerSeraya and Tuas Power, as well as Keppel Merlimau Cogen, Sembcorp Cogen and desalination player Tuaspring, which is building a 411-megawatt power plant.\n\nMr Obert said that to attract liquidity to the electricity futures market, trading hours will be initially concentrated from 2pm-5pm, with a half-hour window from 4.30pm-5pm for the market makers.\n\nFor consumers, the advantage of the futures market is that it is exchange-traded and well supervised, cleared, and therefore poses no credit risks. There is also little liquidity risk given the participation of the gencos. Low capital outlay of a suggested 5-10 per cent is needed, though the numbers have not been finalised yet, Mr Obert added.\n\nWhen the market goes \"live\" from October this year, it will start with a limited suite of products with shorter contract duration and will comprise quarterly contracts for nine consecutive quarters. There will also be a wider bid-ask spread of a maximum $7-$15 per megawatt/hour.\n\nThe early players will be the gencos (market makers) and large industrials, \"although some interested banks are also in talks on this\", said Mr Obert.\n\nIn the next planned \"market growth\" phase from April 2015 to March 2017, SGX intends to add more instruments, such as caps, months or further quarters. Longer trading hours can be expected. The bid-ask spread will also be tighter with a maximum spread of $5-$10 per MWh.\n\nFurther down the road, from April 2017 onwards, SGX's plans show that the electricity futures market could be complemented with a physical and then financial gas market which could potentially reach beyond Singapore.\n\nSpeaking to BT on the sidelines of the forum, YTL PowerSeraya CEO Chan Swee Huat disclosed that the genco was spending $70 million to expand its oil storage capacity to lease out to users. When completed this year-end, it will double the percentage of the genco's revenues from its non-power services to 10 per cent. This is critical, given the thinning margins in the power industry here due to keen competition, as new capacity additions have resulted in power supplies here being double peak demand of some 6,600 MW.\n\nPowerSeraya's cogen plants also provide other utilities like steam to the petrochemical plants at Seraya sector of Jurong Island - which counts players such as Shell, Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore and new players at a high-purity ethylene oxide corridor there - and it is looking at how it can cater to their future needs, including through more investments of its own.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A new breed of young, local chefs are looking East rather than West in their mission to create category-defying, progressive cooking. Debbie Yong reports.\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLabyrinth\n\n5 Neil Road\n\nHours: 7pm-11pm (Tue-Sun)\n\nTel 6223 4098\n\nIT'S been almost a decade since Willin Low first coined the term \"Mod Sin\" to describe his style of fusion cooking, and even the definition of the modern Singaporean, it seems, has been slowly evolving in that time. \"The new modern Singaporean is highly globalised,\" says Han Li Guang. \"He or she didn't just grow up on hawker food but on burgers and fries, too. He is more knowledgeable about food and has been to the top restaurants around the world. He's probably tried the bacon ice-cream at The Fat Duck, and is far more receptive to new ideas than the Singaporean diner of 10 years ago.\"\n\nMr Han should know - he's checked off all these boxes. The 28-year-old left his corporate banking job two years ago, and after a stint of eating around the world and apprenticing under Michelin-starred chefs, he's now head chef and owner of week-old modern experimental restaurant Labyrinth on Neil Road.\n\nOn his menu: avant-garde interpretations of Singaporean classics such as a piquant chilli crab ice cream served with soft shell crab and seaweed fronds on a bed of mantou sand, and siew yoke fan manifested as roasted pork belly on a bed of risotto cooked in ramen broth, and topped with pork scratchings and a sous vide quail egg.\n\nThe initial plan was to open a dessert bar, reveals Mr Han, an avid baker since his university days, \"because I enjoy the technical, scientific approach that doing pastry requires\". That idea soon morphed into a dining in the dark concept, which was eventually scrapped - though the goal to do familiar local flavours with a novel twist stuck.\n\nNamed for the \"adventure through a gastronomical maze that we will lead you through\", the menu at Labyrinth is, aptly, degustation-only. Dinners cost $78 for five courses and $118 for the eight-course option. Lunch, to be introduced in a month, will be priced at $35 and $45 for three and four courses respectively.\n\nThe open kitchen 14-seat counter concept (there's a regular table for six by the entrance for bigger groups), meanwhile, was borne out of a lack of staff, he readily admits, but the upside is that Mr Han's thoughtfully designed creations are best appreciated with direct explanation from the chef.\n\nAnd that's when the fun kicks in. In line with what Mr Han calls \"DNA cooking\", or cooking based on cultural relevance that go beyond mere appearances, dishes are crafted with not just local ingredients but local eating rituals in mind.\n\nA chendol xiaolongbao, for instance, contains grass jelly cubes and red bean and coconut spheres encased in a thin green pandan skin. You eat it by going through the traditional motion of first dipping it in a dish of gula melaka syrup, which you tip out of a vinegar bottle.\n\n\"Fusion is only confusion when it is not well thought out. A lot of restaurants out there are mere copycats. You have to first understand your ingredients to put them together in a reflective way,\" he says.\n\nRather than bank on pricey imported meats, Mr Han prefers to work with local produce, ones that he personally handpicks every morning from a local butcher and a chicken supplier in Shunfu market that his grandmother has been pastronising for the last three decades. \"Sure, we can use Iberico pork from Spain but it tastes better in Spain - not after a 20-hour flight to Singapore,\" he explains.\n\nLikewise his insistence on keeping to his category-defying East-West cooking rather than venture to make his mark in classical French or European cuisine.\n\n\"There's a need to differentiate myself. If I do European cuisine, I will be fighting with chefs who have European heritage and who have many more opportunities to be trained under the great classical cooking chefs,\" says Mr Han, who helped out in the kitchen when visiting chefs Mauro Colagreco and Tom Kerridge were in town. Sous chef Christopher Lim previously toiled at Les Amis and now-closed Mod Sin restaurant, Wok and Barrel.\n\n\"In this new media age, recipes are out there on the Internet, you can learn anything you want to. (Bo Innovation's) Alvin Leung is not a trained chef - maybe that's why his dishes are so unique.\"\n\nHowever different in form, he's still shooting for comparisons with the local torch-bearers, at least in terms of calibre, he states candidly: \"We've got big ambitions. We want to be right up there with Iggy's or Justin Quek one day.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Trust us, it tastes far better than it sounds. \"Chope\" a counter seat by the bar for a more interactive experience (you can even challenge the bartender to a round of checkers played with alcohol shots) or placidly drink in the neighbourhood's historic charm from the plush couches in the lobby lounge.\n\nAh Sam Cold Drink Store\n\n60A Boat Quay\n\nHours: 6pm-midnight (Mon-Thu), 6pm-3am (Fri-Sat)\n\nTel 6535 0838\n\nTHIS second floor speakeasy along Boat Quay is already known for its charming old-school decor and bespoke drinks fusing flavours such as chendol, red bean potong ice-cream and milo, but peckish post-work tipplers will be happy to hear that the bar has started serving a full food menu from this week.\n\nBar manager-turned-chef Edwin Poh is a fourth-generation hawker who has been helping out at his family's hawker stalls since he was eight, and serves up pretty authentic kong bak pau, hokkien mee and char kway tiao ($10 to $12) made with tiger prawns and noodles carted over fresh from his neighbourhood wet market every morning - all while still looking dapper in a shirt and vest with slicked back hair.\n\nHead bartender Sam Wong and Eugene Chua, a recent transplant from Bitters and Love bar, will shake up food-pairing cocktails - such as a savoury dirty martini laced with Worchestershire and tabasco sauce and muddled Peranakan pestle and mortar-style - and a bar snacks menu featuring homemade har cheong gai and ngoh hiang is currently being crafted.\n\nDing Dong\n\n23 Ann Siang Hill\n\nHours: 12pm-3pm (Mon-Fri), 6pm-midnight (Mon-Sat)\n\nTel 6557 0189\n\nQ: WHO in their right mind would tip Chinese black vinegar into a cocktail? A: Who else but the bold boundary-pushers at the Tippling Club? The progressive restaurant's award-winning bartender Zachary de Git turns his attention to modern Asian sister-bar Ding Dong this month, re-tuning over three-quarters of its drinks roster to work in punchier Asian inflections such as the pandan leaf and pineapple and lime grilled with pomegranate molasses in the tequila-based Bahru Bootleg ($20), or the aforementioned Chinese black vinegar, stirred into a stock and shaken with a combination of cognac, framboise and triple sec foam to form the dark and broody Modena stout ($20) that slowly grows on you with each sip. Nursing a scratchy throat? The Pe Pa Kao ($22) is a made-in-Singapore derivative of the classic Rum Old Fashioned, working in dark rum, a twist of local calamansi and the traditional Chinese herbal syrup we all loved licking off spoons as kids - surely as good an excuse as any to keep knocking them back.\n\nHorse's Mouth\n\n583 Orchard Rd, #B1-39\n\nForum The Shopping Mall\n\nHours: 6pm-12am (Mon-Thu), 6pm-1am (Fri-Sat)\n\nTel 6235 1088\n\nFORMER head bartender Louis Tan may have recently left The Horse's Mouth to start up new Neil Road bar L'Aiglon, but incoming lead bartenders Samuel Sim of The Library and Byron Tan, formerly of the W Hotel's Woobar, are quickly sweeping in with a few nifty tricks up their sleeves. Coming soon on the covert basement bar's March menu: potent potions working in savoury flavours such as Thai mango salad, cucumber maki sushi, nasi lemak and chicken rice - all designed to be served in a variety of glassware to resemble the starter, main course and dessert of a three-course meal, says Mr Tan. Intriguing, to say the very least.\n\nFOOD\n\nUjong\n\n1 Beach Road, Raffles Hotel\n\nOpens mid-year\n\nSHEN Tan of now-defunct Mod Sin restaurant Wok and Barrel is poised for a return with restaurant Ujong, set to open around mid-year. The casual eatery under the Caerus Group, which also owns eateries such as Lady M and Nuvo in Marina Square, will take over the 2,000 sq ft Empire Cafe in the Raffles Hotel. Expect a revival of Wok and Barrel signatures such as the beef rendang pizza and pulot hitam pudding with coconut ice-cream and gula melaka, along with new creations such as kaya sticky buns and curry soda breads.\n\nWild Rocket at Mount Emily\n\n10A Upper Wilkie Rd\n\nOpens July 1\n\nAFTER shutting Wild Rocket for a brief recharge and potential relocation in December last year, local chef Willin Low has decided to resume running his restaurant group's flagship restaurant Wild Rocket in its former location within the Hangout Hotel on Mount Emily. Targeted to re-open on July 1 after the hotel's refurbishment, the 40-seater restaurant will have interiors designed by local architect Tan Yi Chen of Produce to reflect its modern Singaporean identity, featuring plenty of wood and detailed carpentry, says Mr Low. The new menu \"won't alienate our regulars\", with old favourites still dotted on the lunch menu, but expect refreshing new updates such as a laksa risotto topped with uni or botan ebi. The group's gourmet burger restaurant Relish, meanwhile, will relocate from Cluny Court to as-yet-undetermined new premises by May.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This comprised a gain of $221 million for the partial divestment in November of a stake in the Bank of Philippine Islands less $50 million set aside to establish the DBS Foundation, which is the group's commitment to social and community development.\n\nFor the full year ended Dec 31, 2013, net profit fell 4 per cent to $3.7 billion.\n\nDespite a higher final dividend payout of 30 cents, up two cents from a year earlier, the stock ended five cents lower at $16.48, on profit-taking after rising for six straight days.\n\nDBS enjoyed a robust Q4 as strong business momentum resulted in total income rising 10 per cent to $2.15 billion - the first time it crossed the $2 billion mark - though this was partially offset by higher allowances. Growth was broad-based, across all business lines and geographies, except India.\n\nChief executive Piyush Gupta noted that the 10 per cent growth in income came about despite a tough business environment, and this testified to the strength of the bank's underlying franchise.\n\n\"If you look . . . all over the region, the fourth quarter was a very tough quarter,\" he said.\n\n\"This last year, the consumer business grew 10 per cent, that's really interesting because if you look at the big challenge for banks around the world . . . the reason many banks are pulling back the consumer business is the low interest rate environment (which) makes it very, very difficult to drive profitability in those businesses,\" he said.\n\nIncome from wealth management rose 18 per cent during the year to $924 million, while assets under management of its private bank rose to $69 billion, up 22 per cent.\n\nDBS also had record income of $1.37 billion, up 11 per cent, from small and medium-sized enterprise customers.\n\nSingapore, its core market, experienced double-digit income, broad-based growth, he said. The Republic contributed 65 per cent or $2.26 billion to total profit of $3.5 billion.\n\n\"All engines are firing extremely well,\" Mr Gupta said.\n\nNet interest income in Q4 increased 12 per cent to $1.45 billion, as loans grew 18 per cent and net interest margin was stable at 1.61 per cent. Non-interest income rose 5 per cent to $697 million. Fee income increased 18 per cent to $439 million, led by wealth management, investment banking, trade and transaction services and cards.\n\nOther non-interest income declined 12 per cent to $258 million, as there had been a gain on fixed-asset sales of $41 million a year ago.\n\nExpenses rose 9 per cent to $1.03 billion. Total allowances increased 32 per cent to $151 million as both general and specific allowances went up.\n\nFourth-quarter net profit was down 7 per cent compared with the previous quarter.\n\nLoans growth this year is likely to fall to 8-10 per cent, while net interest margin is expected to remain around 1.6 per cent, said chief financial officer Chng Sok Hui.\n\nDBS will invest $200 million over three years in digital banking to make the customer experience more interactive and intuitive, Mr Gupta said.\n\nAs for its higher final dividend of 30 cents - taking the full year's payout to 58 cents, up from 56 cents in 2012 - he said the bank \"plans to stick to 58 cents for the foreseeable future\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is stepping up production facilities while Canada's Bombardier is claiming strong sales at the Singapore Airshow, and China is moving ahead with plans to produce regional jets.\n\nWith its dense and growing network of regional air \"hubs\" serving huge populations and with intensive demand for business travel over short to medium distances, the Asia market is a strong attraction for regional producers and to outside makers such as Montreal-based Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer.\n\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) said this week it has compiled a comprehensive production base expansion scheme for mass production of the MRJ (Mitsubishi Regional Jet), a \"next generation\" regional jet now under development.\n\nThe company plans to produce the MRJ at five bases primarily in Japan's Nagoya area and production will also be launched at MHI's Kobe Shipyard & Machinery Works in Hyogo prefecture.\n\nJapan - the Nagoya industrial region especially - is making a strong push to develop its civil aerospace capability at a time when China is conducting test flights on its own Asian Regional Jet or ARJ 21 which is expected to go into production soon.\n\nThe MRJ is a family of 70 to 90-seat regional jets under development by Mitsubishi Aircraft. The jets are said to offer high fuel efficiency and reductions in noise and gas emissions as well as \"spacious cabin comfort on a level unprecedented in regional jets to date\".\n\nOrders have already been received for 325 units of the aircraft with 165 confirmed, Mitsubishi said. The first test flight is scheduled for the second quarter of 2015, and delivery of the first aircraft is planned for the second quarter of 2017.\n\nBombardier said meanwhile that it ended the Singapore Airshow (Asia's biggest such event) with orders and commitments for up to 17 aircraft valued at up to US$852 million. The company also strengthened its presence in the Asia-Pacific region by inaugurating its first wholly-owned service centre for business aircraft and by opening a Regional Support Office for commercial aircraft in Singapore.\n\nBombardier also signed a letter of intent with Flight Safety International and Nantong Tongzhou Bay Aviation to establish next generation aircraft pilot training in Jiangsu, one of China's most affluent and fastest-growing provinces.\n\nIndonesia, comprising more than 17,000 islands, has a population of more than 240 million people, and has a rapidly growing economy. \"Air travel from city to city will undoubtedly increase as time goes on,\" an executive of Hong Kong-based ANI Holdings, a leasing and maintenance group, said. \"Regional jets will therefore be essential for Indonesia.\"\n\nFor highly capital and skill-intensive aerospace ventures to be viable, Japan in particular needs to be able to secure orders from the Asia region, unlike China which has a huge and rapidly expanding market for aircraft on domestic routes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Speaking at DBS's Q4 results briefing, he said it is likely that the prices of high-end homes will slide 15 per cent, and that for lower-end ones, by 10 per cent.\n\nAs for the higher interest rates expected with the shrinking of monetary stimulus policy by the US, he said he was not expecting it to have any effect on DBS. \"The Singapore portfolio is really driven on income considerations . . . As I've said before, the pressure will likely start coming when unemployment rises - more than when property prices change.\" Singapore's unemployment rate is now at a low 1.8 per cent.\n\nMr Gupta said: \"All our stress tests in the past have shown that we can easily withstand a 20 per cent reduction in Singapore property prices without material impact on our portfolio. We stress-test (for a) 20 (per cent fall in property prices), but don't expect it to happen; our stress tests are always calibrated to go off the charts. My own sense is that there will be a correction of 10-15 per cent.\"\n\nHe noted that the market was already stabilising and that the froth was running off, but that if this continued, the government would roll back some of the macro prudential measures. Sales of new mortgages have plunged 30-35 per cent at DBS, and by 40-50 per cent at OCBC Bank as a result of the stricter loan rules.\n\nMr Gupta likened the Singapore property market to that of New York and London, where prices held up even during the financial crisis between 2008 and 2012. While prices in the rest of the US fell by about a third, prices in New York slipped by only 10 per cent. It was a similar situation in London, another city where the demand is not dependent on the state of the domestic economy.\n\nMr Gupta said he expects regional money buying properties here to also put a floor under prices. With the slower sales, DBS's $49.1 billion mortgage book is likely to grow by $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year, down from $3.5 billion last year and $5 billion the year before that, said Mr Gupta.\n\nOCBC Bank chief operating officer Ching Wei Hong said of the new mortgage sales having declined across the board: \"That's expected, given all the cooling measures that have been imposed. We've built up a healthy inventory level. The inventory drives the growth of (the loan) book, going into 2014 and 2015. Beyond 2015 H2 and 2016, if conditions remain the same, we'll see a bit of tapering in that period.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And that's what you get to see with the award-winning musical My Fair Lady - a working-class girl turning into a lady - but that's just one side of the story.\n\n\"It's the story of Cinderella with a twist,\" says Jeffery Moss, 69, the director of the US National Tour of My Fair Lady, which ran for seven months in 2012 and just opened in Singapore at the Sands Theatre this week.\n\n\"That's the irony of the story. He's the teacher, she's the student. But at the end, she takes this guy who thinks he's a gentleman, and shows him how to really become one,\" explains Moss with a chuckle.\n\nThe story follows a young girl named Eliza Doolittle who makes a living selling flowers on the streets of London in 1912. One night, her rough Cockney accent as a working-class Londoner attracts the attention of a phonetics professor named Henry Higgins - a lover of proper speech and enunciation.\n\nHiggins makes a bet that within three months of speech lessons with him, Eliza will be rid of her current accent and be able to pass off as a high-born English lady. After some thought, she takes up his offer in hopes of making a better living for herself, and that's where the story begins.\n\nFor Moss, he believes that the relatable scenes and witty script have been what kept the show relevant all these years, even though it is based on a play that was first staged in 1912 titled Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw.\n\n\"It's so universal. We're in Asia with this show, and even with the different cultures, different mindsets, it seems to talk to people universally. I think that's one of the reasons people say it's one of the greatest musicals of all time,\" says Moss.\n\nMy Fair Lady became a musical in 1956, with book and lyrics by Alan Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. It starred Julie Andrews as Eliza and Rex Harrison as Henry in the original Broadway production which won six Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Direction of a Musical and Best Choreography.\n\nIt spawned a movie version in 1964, with Harrison reprising his role as Henry and Audrey Hepburn taking on the role of Eliza. The movie bagged eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nAs the director of such an iconic piece of theatre, Moss reveals that people do tend to compare his production with the earlier editions, but that doesn't bother him one bit.\n\n\"I'm proud of it when people say this reminds them of the original production. I'm happy in fact. It was a long time ago, it set the mark, it's iconic,\" he says.\n\nLikewise, actress Aurora Florence, who plays the role of Eliza Doolittle in this production, is unfazed that she has to fill the shoes of big names like Andrews and Hepburn. Instead, she focuses on bringing her own element to the character - a \"grit\" that reflects Eliza's rough background in what she calls a sometimes farcical production.\n\n\"I don't try to copy them (Andrews and Hepburn). There's nothing specific that I try to do that they did. But I'm sure that because I grew up watching the movie and I listened to the soundtrack from Julie Andrews, there are some things I do that would be very similar,\" explains Florence. The 24-year-old is also known for co-founding the American alternative pop band Imagine Dragons, and releasing her own EP It's Wonderful last year.\n\nAdding on to Florence's views, Moss insists that while he retains most elements of the previous productions, he is not copying the way My Fair Lady has been staged in the past.\n\n\"There are certain things that are in the script because the original production did it that way, and we acknowledge it. We're not foolish enough to say let's set it in another city or something like that... We're showing the story to the audience in our own way.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA VISIT to Michael Lim's home is much like visiting a chateau in France but without having to endure a 12-hour long flight. The European experience starts right at the compound gate, where a pair of larger than life centurion statues stand guard.\n\nLike with most chateaus, this one, off Holland Road, comes with an immensely long driveway, before a two-storey mansion with elaborate columns, a steeply-pitched roof, and a water fountain right up front, comes into view.\n\n\"When you look at the house, you think you are somewhere in Europe rather than in Singapore,\" quips Dr Lim, medical director at the Singapore Heart, Stroke & Cancer Centre, who drew up the design of his home after visiting several French chateaus and the Palace of Versailles for inspiration. \"I am someone who loves art, and wanted my home to have the same European architecture.\"\n\nIndeed, the mansion is very much a conversation starter. Throw open the doors and a grand marble staircase with ornate floral balustrades, and topless nubile female statues on both sides, greet visitors.\n\nWorking with an architect, Dr Lim designed the home to have plenty of voluminous space, \"so as to not feel boxed in\", he explains. \"A spacious home also makes you feel more relaxed.\"\n\nThe ceilings are all two-storeys high, and the presence of numerous marble columns in the home create that visual height. The home, which also comes with an attic and basement, is definitely big enough for the 53-year-old Dr Lim, his wife, Wendy Huang, the centre's CEO, and their five children, aged from five months to 25 years old.\n\nDr Lim is clearly lord of the manor. \"Wendy prefers a modern kind of home, something which needs less upkeep,\" he says. The family has domestic helpers, but the annual cleaning is outsourced to a cleaning company.\n\nThe staircase is not the only wow feature of the home. Dr Lim is especially proud of the formal dining room located at an adjoining wing. The room is expansive, with crystal chandeliers, an ornately decorated ceiling, and gold curtains with silk tassels. Should a count or countess in period costume walk through, no one would bat an eyelid. The area comes alive during festive periods, when Dr Lim has family and friends over. \"Once, we hosted over 100 people, and there was still plenty of room for everyone,\" he says.\n\nWhen it comes to furnishing the home, it was only natural to have pieces that would complement the European architecture.\n\nEach piece was personally selected by Dr Lim. \"Since I sketched the design of the home, I knew exactly what pieces I would need and where to place them,\" he says. The home took three years to build and furnish.\n\n\"I like pieces which show artistic effort, such as the wooden hand carving on the back of a chair or the fine detailing on the edge of a mirror,\" he says.\n\nOne of his precious finds is a 100-year-old grand piano made from malachite with gold embellishments. Dr Lim's youngest plays it.\n\nDr Lim prefers to keep the bedrooms private, but will gladly take visitors to the attic, where he has his \"art room\".\n\nOne wall is lined with watercolour and oil paintings of scenes in Singapore, all painted by him. \"Painting is one of my hobbies,\" he says, and the Singapore Watercolour Society invites him to showcase his pieces at its annual exhibitions.\n\nOn the opposite wall is a collection of artworks by Chinese masters including Xu Beihong, Fu Baoshi and Wu Guanzhong. \"The pieces belong to Wendy, and they have been in her family for years,\" says Dr Lim.\n\nApart from painting, Dr Lim's other love is collecting ceramics. That's evident from the display shelf holding Chinese ceramics, such as vases and bowls that date back to the Han and Ming dynasties. His favourite Chinese ceramic pieces, however, are kept under lock and key, in his room.\n\nOn the other side of the room, are \"Western antiques\" - including a collection of gold rimmed crystal glassware from Moser which in the old days, supplied to French royalty. Another gem is a jewellery box from French label Tahan, which also supplied pieces to French royalty. \"I appreciate the work that goes into making these intricate pieces,\" says Dr Lim.\n\nWhen it comes to buying antiques, he has some advice. \"Don't buy thinking that you can make money from it, otherwise you'll regret it,\" he says. \"Ask yourself if it is worth the price, because you must enjoy what you buy.\"\n\nApart from the art room, the karaoke room in the basement displays less of an European touch. It's modern for a reason, as Dr Lim explains. \"There was no such thing as a karaoke room in 19th century.\"\n\nDr Lim takes pride in knowing that his home is vastly different from the typical glass homes in Singapore. \"The architecture is different, but yet the home is functional, and I always look forward to coming home.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I felt it was quite a waste for the tiles to be thrown away, especially since these tiles are a big part of the Peranakan culture,\" says Mr Lim, who gave up collecting coins and stamps because \"they were too costly\".\n\nTogether with a friend, the two began salvaging Peranakan tiles from homes that were about to be demolished, and would often have friendly competitions to see who could garner a bigger collection.\n\n\"My search for the tiles expanded from the seaside bungalows at East Coast to the shophouses in the Jalan Besar and Kallang areas,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nHe had about 100 pieces of tiles in his collection. \"Back then, there was little value in these tiles, as no one wanted or paid attention to them, so it was easy to get hold of them.\"\n\nThree years ago, the former hotelier decided to start Aster by Kyra, a business selling his collection of Peranakan tiles, which now number about 20,000 pieces, salvaged from shophouses in Singapore and Malaysia. \"The goal is not only to keep this Peranakan culture alive, but also to make some money from my hobby,\" he quips.\n\nThese decorative tiles are officially termed majolica tiles, and the first pieces were believed to have been imported into Singapore from Britain in 1891. \"They were used as floor tiles,\" says Mr Lim, who has done much research on the history of the tiles. He also plans to write a book on the topic.\n\nSuch tiles were popular in the 19th century in British homes, and often had an art noveau or floral motif. Besides tiles from Britain, there are also tiles made in Japan, and these have a more Asian look to them, featuring fruits, and mythical creatures such as the kirin.\n\nMr Lim is believed to be the only person in Singapore to salvage old tiles, and contractors know to call him when they are about to demolish an old building.\n\nHe now gets his tiles from temple courtyards, and other public buildings, and from the occasional shophouse. \"Many shophouses today are under conservation, so the tiles on the facade cannot be removed, but I can salvage the ones in the interiors,\" he explains.\n\nThe tiles have to be carefully removed from the walls, to prevent chips and breakage. Often they come with the cement backing attached. The pieces are soaked in water for two to three weeks to remove the cement and dirt.\n\nThe restoration process continues at his workshop in Midview City, with the tiles soaking in a plastic container of solution that contains detergent and chlorine for another two weeks. The tiles are then cleaned with turpentine before getting another two-week bath in detergent to get rid of the turpentine smell. The final process involves polishing them with kerosene. Mr Lim learnt the process of restoration on his own.\n\nFor tiles with minor chips, repairs are done by applying cement and reglazing the tile.\n\nWhile most of the tiles in the store are antique ones, Mr Lim also has a selection of customised tiles. To the untrained eye, these tiles look very much like their antique counterparts. There are slight differences - antique tiles have a toxic, metallic glaze on them. \"The new tiles have a pigment glaze,\" says Mr Lim. The colours on the new tiles also tend to be less vibrant compared to the antique ones.\n\nDepending on the condition and rarity of the antique tiles, each piece can cost from $44 to $280. It is a far cry from back in the 19th century, when each piece cost 12.5 cents, and were already considered expensive so only rich families could afford them. The customised tiles cost $12.50 a piece.\n\nMr Lim's antique tiles have found a new lease of life in homes, sometimes as hanging art pieces and also in restaurants. \"I went into this because of passion, and I want to keep the heritage value going,\" he says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's no wonder it has been called the greatest musical of all time.\n\nEverything in it practically screams \"classic\" - from the preppy costumes to the exquisite set and meaningful music - it's a picture-perfect portrayal of London in 1912 in all its glory.\n\nThe show begins with a young Cockney girl Eliza Doolittle (Aurora Florence) selling flowers outside an opera house when she realises Higgins is hiding behind a pillar taking notes on her speech.\n\nAlthough initially offended by his arrogant nature, she eventually agrees to be part of his bet that he can change her working girl accent into one of a high-born lady, in hopes of making a better life for herself.\n\nOf course sparks fly as Higgins continues to treat her like a member of the lower classes, even after she masters a \"proper English accent\". It results in the unusual love story between two bickering individuals.\n\nAt some points in the show, the plot borders on draggy and gets a tad boring, especially in the second act, but picks up with every appearance of Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle (Michael Brian Dunn).\n\nHis fast-paced songs like With A Little Bit Of Luck and Get Me To The Church On Time, set to the skilful lively choreography of Denis Jones and with the assistance of an energetic cast, are much welcome breaks of light-hearted humour in the three-hour show.\n\nAnd Florence's performance is commendable as well. The 24-year-old proves to be a formidable force in the face of inevitable comparison with her predecessors Julie Andrews and Audrey Hepburn for her role as Doolittle.\n\nShe effectively holds her own and delivers a hypnotising performance with her clear sweet vocals, to the point where you'll be sure to hum Wouldn't It Be Loverly all the way home from the theatre.\n\nMy Fair Lady runs at the Sands Theatre at Marina Bay Sands till March 2, from Tue to Fri at 8pm, and on Sat and Sun at 2pm and 8pm.

Not only is she beautiful and makes great coffee, she also laughs at all his jokes - the nervous, stuttering Woody Allen type that, incidentally, has long lost its screen appeal.\n\nSam scans her Facebook profile and finds out that she loves French cooking, guitar-playing men, Joan Baez songs and Carlos Castaneda's bible for hippies The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge - the perfect hipster list if there ever was one.\n\nSo off he goes to learn French cooking, the guitar, Joan Baez songs and the New Age teachings of Castaneda. When he shows up at a theatre to deliberately bump into her, he tells her he plays the guitar and they soon start to date.\n\nNow, anyone with dating experience knows that pretending to be someone you're not can only doom you and the relationship in the long term. You can maintain the charade for a time but it always catches up with you.\n\nUnfortunately, 30something Sam must have missed that lesson in his 20s. And so did A Case of You's producers in the last millennium. So what the audience gets instead is a perfect romantic fantasy in which the very sexy Birdie falls deeply in love with very nerdy Sam. Eventually, Birdie discovers his ruse, but she quickly forgives him and everyone dances - yes, they literally dance.\n\nMaybe, this writer is cynical. Maybe he doesn't know a single relationship in which nothing bad ever happens. But a movie strung together by an endless series of adorable, aww-shucks couple moments feels somehow false and hollow.\n\nWhen one watches a \"stop the bomb and save the world\" blockbuster with computer-generated actors, one knows to suspend one's disbelief and enjoy the popcorn. But when a low-budget romantic movie tries to portray love in earnest, it should at least strive to show you something genuine and enduring about love - and not just the cute, easy parts.\n\nApparently, the producers asked legendary musician Joni Mitchell if they could play her wistful 1971 love song A Case of You in the movie. She wisely declined.\n\nRating:\n\nC-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their room choice can be made from a display in the lobby, paid for at a machine with keys dispensed through a small window.\n\nStaff (when they do appear) are polite, but neutral, doing their best to blend into anonymity and instantly forget the faces they see.\n\nAcademic Ikkyon Kim, who has written on the subject, said \"love hotels\" came about during Japan's feudal era, which lasted until the mid-19th century.\n\n\"Of course, they weren't called that at the time, but there have long been rooms that a couple could rent for a few hours,\" he said.\n\n\"Before World War II, there were a number of ryokan (traditional Japanese- style inns with tatami mat flooring) which operated along these lines.\"\n\nBut it was in the boom years of the 1950s and '60s where the modern form was firmly established.\n\n\"They came about to fill a need,\" said Mr Kim. \"People were living in these tiny apartments where the whole family would sleep in the same room at night. There was no chance for any privacy.\"\n\nAs Japan got richer \"hotels became these large concrete buildings with many rooms, each with its own bath, a big bed, a colour television and all the kind of things people wanted to have at home\".\n\nIn the 1970s, owners started experimenting with more exotic forms - castles, fantastical rooms, and rotating beds - and others followed.\n\nBound by strict rules on tasteful advertising, but unhampered by the kind of planning regulations that are intended to maintain architectural harmony in European cities, extravagant designs with pink turrets or gaudily-painted Cadillacs improbably balanced on roofs loudly announced their presence to passers- by, without ever mentioning sex.\n\nThe frothiness of Japan's 1980s bubble economy, when almost anything seemed possible, led to an explosion in \"love hotels\".\n\nEstimates suggest there are up to 30,000 in Japan now, in an industry worth a staggering 4 trillion yen (S$49.4 billion) a year.\n\nMore than two decades since the bubble burst, the sector is still in a robust state, \"even if it's not quite as good as it was back then\", laments Mr Tsunoda, who says the rise of the Internet has pushed owners to up their game.\n\n\"Previously, couples would just go into the first place they came to on the street, but nowadays they can use their smartphone to compare what's in the area and take their pick,\" he said.\n\nClients are always looking for novelty, for a unique experience, said the manager of The Rock, a \"love hotel\" in the style of a haunted house in a Tokyo suburb.\n\n\"It's getting more and more difficult to distinguish ourselves,\" she said. \"It's hard to find the kind of facilities and equipment that customers don't already have at home.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The group also intends to deploy the rigs in offshore drilling markets of Africa, the Middle East and South-east Asia.\n\n\"Building three premium rigs at the same time will enable us to accelerate our presence in this industry and establish ourselves as a serious drilling contractor in the market,\" said industrial entrepreneur AP Dobrov, who backs Fecon.\n\nHe said teaming up with the world's leading rig builder, Keppel FELS, will help fast-track Fecon's entry into the market. \"Their track record of delivering on time, without incident and on budget will ensure we get maximum value and returns on our investment.\"\n\nMr Dobrov said the group believes there is a need for more high-specification jack-up rigs in the market as the replacement cycle continues, and the KFELS B class rig will be \"the most efficient rig in the greatest number of locations\".\n\nThe three rigs are scheduled for delivery progressively in the second half of 2016, with payment terms at 20 per cent on order placement and 80 per cent upon delivery. At about US$217 million apiece, the rigs are priced in line with recent contracts with an earlier delivery date.\n\nThe KFELS B class rig can stand in water depths up to 400 feet and drill to 30,000 feet. On Fecon's requirements, the rigs will each have a full 15,000 psi BOP (blowout preventer) system 75 feet cantilever outreach and accommodation for 150 people.\n\n\"KepFELS has built and delivered more than 50 KFELS B class jack-up rigs since 2000, all of which are operating successfully in various parts of the world,\" said Keppel Offshore & Marine managing director Wong Kok Seng.\n\nBesides those delivered, the group has 27 new KFELS B class rigs on order, which would give the rig type a one-third market share of all jack-up rigs built, delivered and on order since 2000. Including all jack-up rig types the group has built, Keppel would have a close to 50 per cent market share of rigs built since 2000.\n\nWith this new contract, the total value of new contracts secured to date is US$868 million. Last week, the group said it had clinched a US$218 million contract to build a similar rig for UMW Drilling 8 (L) Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of UMW Oil & Gas Corp.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the group to secure between $5 billion and $6 billion in new contracts this year. Last year, the group bagged $7 billion in new contracts and had an order backlog of $14.2 billion as at Dec 31, 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mid-morning that day, they suddenly came under tremendous pressure in high volume, quite naturally drawing a query from the Singapore Exchange (SGX). This was duly dispatched at 1.36pm.\n\nThis is all well and good, and would be familiar ground for most market observers. The problem is that - incredibly - SGX sent its standard template asking OSI to explain the substantial increase in its share price when it should have asked about the decrease.\n\nSixteen minutes later, at 1.52pm, possibly because it realised its error (though this is not explicitly stated), SGX issued a notice to ignore the previous query but did not mention anything else.\n\nAt 2pm, after the shares had collapsed nine cents or 31 per cent to 20 cents, OSI requested a trading halt pending release of an announcement.\n\nAt 2.07pm, seven minutes after the shares were suspended and 15 minutes after withdrawing its earlier query, SGX sent off its standard query template but with \"decrease\" mentioned in place of \"increase\". Some seven hours later, at 9.04pm, Ezion said in a filing that the deal had been terminated. This was followed a minute later by OSI filing the same announcement.\n\nSGX's queries, including its blunder, raise questions over just how vigilant its surveillance really is, and highlights how far behind the curve it operates. Even if it had asked the right questions at 1.36pm, thus satisfying its brief as mainly a signaller of caution to the market, it would have made almost no difference - OSI's shares, at 21.5 cents at that time, had already crashed spectacularly.\n\nFurthermore, the correctly worded query was issued seven minutes after the company suspended trading. So it carried no signalling or informational value whatsoever because nobody could have acted on it even if they had wanted to.\n\nIt is therefore difficult to refute the widely held belief that the exchange's archaic querying process as it stands today is weak and ineffective. Fortunately, the process is currently under review and proposals to raise the surveillance and querying bar were issued for public consultation last week.\n\nIf the exchange and regulators wish to redeem themselves, they should embark on a thorough investigation of the hurried sales which hit the market on Wednesday during the five hours of trading from 9am to 2pm.\n\nHopefully, when this is actually done, the findings will be divulged quickly. Wait too long and the incident will slip quietly into the annals of the local market's history - which is teeming with similar cases over the years that appear to have escaped official scrutiny.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His later application to join the art institute, Netherlands-Indies Kunstkring (Art Circle), in Jakarta however, was rejected on the grounds that he was Indonesian.\n\nThese two events in his life purportedly spurred the artist to embrace a political slant through his art and also to champion the craft - developing a term \"Jiwa Ketok\" (visible soul) for his approach, which is to capture the expression and soul of their subjects.\n\nTogether with Persagi, a movement he co-founded, he rejected the \"Mooi Indie\" (beautiful Indies) style with its colonial and touristy perspectives of Indonesia, knowing that it didn't convey the reality of Indonesians.\n\nHis approach - both in thought and painting - was so seminal that it's not without reason that Sudjojono, born in 1913 and who died in 1986, is called the Father of Indonesian Modernism.\n\nLast year, his birth centenary was celebrated, and now, an exhibition in Singapore - S Sudjojono: Lives of Pictures\" - also showcases the artist's works and inspirations. The exhibition is part of the S Sudjojono Centennial Celebrations with the main exhibition held in Jakarta last December.\n\nBut the Singapore exhibition is curated differently. And it's also the first time archival works from Sudjojono's two families - of his first and second wives - are shown in one exhibition, explains Syed Muhd Hafiz, one of the three guest curators of the show now on at Nanyang Technological University's School of Art, Design and Media (ADM) Gallery.\n\n\"In previous exhibitions, material from either his first wife's family or second wife's family would be shown, but not both. We were able to put the two together thanks to the contacts that we have with both families,\" explains Hafiz. Sudjojono had divorced his first wife in 1958 and married his second wife a year later; which didn't just herald a change in his personal life, but also his political one.\n\nThe Singapore exhibition also differs from the one in Jakarta which celebrated his centenary with a selection of works in chronological order, like a retrospective. Here, the exhibition looks deeper into his art-making and narratives, through his art work and archival material.\n\n\"The last time Sudjojono's works were exhibited in Singapore was in 2008, at the NUS Museum, in the context of Indonesian art,\" adds Hafiz.\n\nThe exhibition in Singapore was able to take this angle, thanks to the curators - Hafiz, Seng Yu Jin, and Wang Zineng, who works in different capacities in a university, museum and auction house. \"So each of us have a perspective to share,\" shares Hafiz.\n\n\"We thought it was an opportunity to expose a wider Singapore audience to Sudjojono's work, given that he also has collectors here, and by showcasing his writings, to also examine his influence on South-east Asian art.\"\n\nIn many ways, Sudjojono's art criticism and writing continues to influence artists today, believes Hafiz. \"Sudjojono's is a name you still hear, and his iconic articles are still revisited.\"\n\nThe three curators were also interested in addressing the bias in previous Sudjojono exhibitions: his works with his second wife, Rose Pandanwangi are better known, thanks as well to a Sudjojono Centre she set up in 2006.\n\nSudjojono's first wife, Mia Bustam, was a well-known communist figure in the Sukarno era, and was jailed during an anti-left wing slant in Suharto's New Order government. Sudjojono quit the communist party for his second wife, a move which saved him when there was later a purge against communist party supporters.\n\nThere are 11 works of art in this exhibition and 12 sketches, while the archival material includes video interviews with the family members from both wives' families, to provide more context to the artwork.\n\nPoints out Hafiz: \"As Sudjojono became more socially conscious and politically involved, his art went into more social realism. Art, for Sudjojono, should serve the country and the people, and he used it to awaken the national consciousness of Indonesians.\"\n\nLater on, the artist would retreat from political life, a move which is also reflected in his works.\n\nGiven the current diplomatic spat between Singapore and Indonesia (over the naming of Indonesian warships after men deemed as terrorists by Singapore), Hafiz hopes that it won't have too much bearing on the investigation and showcasing of Indonesian art here.\n\n\"There's just so much similarity of cultures between Singapore and Indonesia, and Malaysia - more than differences that we should have a better understanding of the artists from the other countries,\" he notes.\n\nSudjojono's Lives of Pictures exhibition is held at NTU's School of Art, Design and Media Gallery from now until March 1. The address is 81 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637458. The gallery is open from 10am-5pm from Mon-Fri, and from 12pm-5pm on Sat.

The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists was for an increase to 58. A measure of the number of properties for sale fell to the lowest since July 2012.\n\nAn improvement in credit conditions along with the lack of homes for sale has underpinned prices over the past year, raising concerns about the sustainability of the market. Bank of England (BOE) chief economist Spencer Dale said on BBC radio yesterday while he doesn't think the UK is heading towards a housing bubble, officials will watch developments \"very carefully\".\n\n\"With more people now in a position to buy a home than at any point over the past few years, there are simply not enough properties to satisfy demand,\" said Peter Bolton King, RICS global residential director, in the statement. \"The upshot of this are increasing prices in many areas, and this looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nPart of the decline in the RICS index in January may have been weather-related, according to Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London. The measure of new buyer enquiries fell to 31 from 48 in December, the lowest in eight months. The measure of new properties coming on to the market dropped to minus 3 from 3.\n\nMr Wood said house prices may increase 10 per cent this year, in part helped by \"rock bottom\" interest rates after BOE governor Mark Carney signalled on Wednesday that he's in no rush to raise borrowing costs. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Even in constant currency terms, revenue was 2 per cent lower, with Australia's consumer operating revenue falling 6.9 per cent to A$1.78 billion (A$2 billion) for the quarter.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was 4.3 per cent higher at $2.75 billion, while revenue was 7.2 per cent lower at $12.7 billion - also brought low by Down Under.\n\nThis Australian-millstone narrative will hold for the financial year ending March 31, 2014. SingTel's group consumer revenue is now expected to decline by low double-digit levels - previously only slated to decline by the high single-digits. At the same time, group enterprise revenue, previously expected to be stable, is now forecast to decline by the low single-digits. The outlook for group Ebitda - a low single digit-level decline - was maintained, alongside the expectation of a mid single-digit level decline in group revenue.\n\nWhile the weaker Australian dollar narrative has been a standing feature of late, it has been joined by the less-robust business sentiment held by Australian firms and regional MNCs.\n\nSome of this showed in the third quarter, which saw group enterprise's operating revenue dip 0.2 per cent to $1.55 billion on the weaker Australian dollar. Over the nine-month period, enterprise operating revenue from Australia also declined 0.9 per cent to A$1.14 billion.\n\nEven so, a strong showing from SingTel's regional mobile associates helped to bolster numbers, with the share of their pre-tax profits rising 10.9 per cent to $539 million. This was hauled upwards by Airtel, which saw its pre-tax profit contribution more than double from $70 million to $148 million.\n\nAcquisition-wise, future pickings in emerging markets with low penetration rates and revenue growth opportunities appear slim.\n\n\"There're fewer and fewer of those markets left where we think that the valuation is compelling,\" said Chua Sock Koong, SingTel Group CEO.\n\nAs associates' contribution grew in Q3, operating expenses also declined 10.1 per cent to $3 billion - partially driven by lower handset subsidy costs.\n\nThis decline was the result of both a conscious lowering of handset subsidies and the Android influence on the mix of handsets sold in the quarter. Android handsets tend to command a lower operator subsidy than iPhones do.\n\nWhile a gloomy tale was told Down Under, Singapore sang a relatively jaunty tune.\n\nFor the third quarter, mobile revenue here rose 5.8 per cent to $322 million. Its local mobile base grew by 205,000 subscribers year-on-year, ending the period with 3.96 million. Monthly average revenue per postpaid user stood at $78 for the quarter, down from $81 in the corresponding quarter the previous year.\n\nAt the same time, mio TV's residential customers rose from 398,000 in the previous year's third quarter to 418,000. As the 2014 World Cup looms large in SingTel's goalmouth this year, the operator would only say that it is in discussions with the rightsholder.\n\n\"It's very clear in our minds ... what the qualitative and quantitative benefits are of getting that event. Right now, there's nothing significant to tell,\" said Allen Lew, SingTel's CEO of Group Digital Life.\n\nSingTel's digital division continued an exponential growth in revenue, which rose 40.3 per cent year-on-year to $48 million. Negative Ebitda also surged, from $15 million in Q3 of the previous year to $42 million.\n\nYesterday, SingTel also revised its expected cash capital expenditure for Singapore and Australia, now expected to come in at about $2.2 billion instead of $2.5 billion, driven by the impact of a weaker Australian dollar and delayed spending.\n\nEarnings per share for the group stood at 5.47 cents and 17.28 cents for the quarter and nine-month period, respectively, up from 5.19 cents and 16.57 cents from the corresponding periods a year ago. The group's counter closed at $3.57 yesterday, up six cents.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Pre-Internet era, the film also gained a certain notoriety for its raunchy love scenes which initially earned it an X rating in the US before it was re-edited to a less racy R; and featured a scene where a then-16-year-old Brooke Shields takes it all off in front of a fireplace.\n\nFast forward 33 years later - in a digital age where willing naughty selfies posted on social media networks are par for the course for any attention-seeking nubile starlet - and it comes as a slight surprise that writer-director Shana Feste's (Country Strong) reboot could turn out to be this chaste. But who could blame her when the leads, Alex Pettyfer (Magic Mike) and Gabriella Wilde (Carrie), both have a toothy apple-pie wholesomeness that can only naturally steer this remake towards PG territory.\n\nSo this version of Endless Love gets about as explicit as those MTV-type spring break reality shows that feature plenty of teenagers in skimpy outfits but draw the line at nudity. Save for one very brief scene where Wilde disrobes a la Shields in front of the fireplace (but with her long blonde hair strategically shielding her naughty bits), the rest of the sex scenes are implied and mostly don't go beyond a few seconds of tonguing between Wilde and Pettyfer.\n\nInstead, Feste and her co-writer Joshua Safran (Gossip Girl) try their hands at injecting a little more drama into their adaptation of Scott Spencer's original 1979 novel of the same name. Which sounds like a swell idea if the results weren't so cliched and boringly predictable.\n\nWilde plays Jade, a poor little rich girl whose snotty doctor dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) frowns on her blossoming romance with Pettyfer's David. Never mind the latter is charmingly earnest but the fact that he comes from the wrong side of the tracks and isn't going to college like Jade is enough reason for the old man to do whatever he can from stopping the two from seeing each other.\n\nHis efforts include sending Jade off early for an internship, calling for a last-minute family-only holiday at their remote lake house and finally taking a restraining order out against David. But the film is not called Endless Love for nothing if this amorous couple can be so easily separated, as the pair do whatever they can to convince Hugh their love is the real deal.\n\nIt's all Mills and Boon stuff to make teenage girls swoon and Pettyfer's square-jawed dreamboat looks alone does half the job. It's mildly entertaining at best thanks to the easy chemistry between the two leads (both Brits playing American teenagers, no less) and Feste has gone the distance to make this reboot her own so even that famous Ritchie-Ross duet doesn't get remade for the soundtrack.\n\nToo bad it's also terribly unmemorable and so lightweight it can only be taken as seriously as a summer fling.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the Asia-Pacific (Apac) showed an improvement with 80 per cent of respondents, up from just 50 per cent in 2011 - indicating that while boards of directors take an active interest in AML, this is still short of the global average.\n\nOn regular discussion of AML issues at the board level, it was 51 per cent for Apac, compared to the global average of 66 per cent.\n\nAs for AML training for board members, only 47 per cent of Apac financial institutions have it, 15 percentage points lower than the global average.\n\nLem Chin Kok, KPMG Singapore partner heading AML and sanction services, noted that regulators in the region are becoming more vocal in their expectations of the role that the board of directors play in the oversight of AML compliance programmes.\n\n\"In particular, regulators are asking the board of directors to demonstrate active management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, to develop a robust risk culture throughout their organisations, and to ensure that their AML compliance programmes are sufficiently resourced,\" said Mr Lem.\n\n\"As a result, we expect that board-level interest in AML will continue to increase,\" he said.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has also increased its AML efforts.\n\n\"I do believe that the MAS has similarly raised its expectations as the paradigm shifts. The designation of tax crimes as money laundering predicate offences last July and the release of the national money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment report earlier this year are examples,\" he said.\n\nRegulatory change remains a key driver of AML initiatives, with many regulators introducing and enhancing requirements over the last few years.\n\nSome 82 per cent of Apac respondents indicated that the pace and impact of regulatory change are a top concern.\n\nThey said the top three areas that regulators focus on during site visits are customer due diligence (70 per cent), ongoing monitoring (56 per cent), and enterprise-wide AML risk assessments (54 per cent).\n\nA significant number also mentioned politically exposed persons and sanctions compliance as areas of interest for regulators, broadly in line with other parts of the world.\n\nMr Lem has also observed heightened scepticism among regulators.\n\n\"For example, the regulators may no longer be satisfied that a bank has a sanctions surveillance system. The regulators may want to know how the bank ensures that the system is functioning properly, that routines configured are working as intended, and that the system will continue to be effective,\" he said.\n\n\"Similarly, the regulators may no longer be satisfied that a bank only performs checks for adverse news on its clients during periodic reviews. The regulators may question the duration between the checks or the scope of the checks.\"\n\nSimilar to other regions, Apac respondents highlighted a lack of qualified resources as one of their top concerns.\n\nSome 67 per cent of Apac respondents have more than three years of experience in AML, compared to 82 per cent in Western Europe and 85 per cent in North America.\n\nSeparately, the report said that United States tax law, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), due to be implemented by July 2014, has the potential to become a significant driver of improvements in the KYC or know your customer process. Fatca requires all financial institutions outside the US to provide data on accounts of US nationals to the taxman.\n\nIn Apac, over 40 per cent of respondents said incomplete customer due diligence records are the top concern for Fatca compliance, followed by process changes.\n\nMeanwhile, less than 50 per cent of Apac respondents believe they will be Fatca-compliant by July 2014, despite the six-month extension that was granted.\n\nSaid Mr Lem: \"We believe that regulators in the region will increasingly enter into agreements to exchange information. Hence, financial institutions, including those in Singapore, will likely face greater uncertainties and challenges in the near future.\n\n\"Their focus is also likely to broaden beyond the banking sector to include other sectors such as remittance agents, money-changers, internet-based stored value facility holders, corporate service providers, pawnbrokers and gaming operations.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

I chose vintages 2010 and 2011 for the Burgundy tasting at Paul\u00e9e de Singapour 2014 to show that notwithstanding the general opinion that 2011 was ranked the least of the three, the overall quality of the vintage, in both red and white, was not far off from the 2010.\n\nI still remember clearly the pronouncements of Frederick Mugnier of Domaine JF Mugnier when we were barrel-tasting his 2011s in his cellar in the autumn of 2012. He regards his 2011 as rather similar to his 2008s, which he surprisingly said he preferred to his 2009s!\n\nHe regarded 2010 as the best of the three, a classic Burgundy vintage, ranking with the greatest of all Burgundy vintages. The situation vis-a-vis 2010 and 2011 parallels that between 2001 and 2002, a comparative tasting of which was the theme of the first Paul\u00e9e de Singapour in 2005.\n\nAltogether 63 Burgundies, 42 red and 21 white, were tasted, and I do not know what the rest of the tasters felt but at the end of the three sessions, I was inclined to think that 2010 and 2011 were very close in overall quality, albeit different in their individual strengths. Looking over my tasting notes again it was striking how little the differences were between them - to my palate, at least.\n\nMy own conclusions at the end of the tasting was that there was little to choose qualitatively between the two vintages of each wine, and that any difference that could be discerned would be the result of individual taste preferences.\n\nPut it another way, I would happily drink either vintage - provided I could get hold of them, and even if I could, it would be provided I could afford them!\n\nOne-liners on selected wines:\n\nBeaune 1er cru Clos des Ursules, Louis Jadot\n\n2010 more density and breadth, 2011 perhaps a little lighter, just as enjoyable.\n\nVolnay 1er cru Santenots de Millieu, Comtes Lafon\n\n2011 very ripe big cherries, very long.\n\n2010 great fruit, great ripeness, more acidity.\n\nChambolle Musigny 1er cru, Pacalet\n\n2011 a light wine.\n\n2010 good ripeness, with good length and freshness.\n\nChambolle Musigny 1er cru Baudes, Drouhin\n\n2011& 2010 both exemplary examples of Chambolle Musigny character - the colour a glorious transparent, medium-red, the Pinot Noir-perfumed bouquet light and floating in the air, the transparently textured palate. Both very concentrated, beautiful fruit. Do not choose between the two if you ever come across them. And please let me know where you find them!\n\nCorton Grand Cru, Bonneau du Martray\n\n2010 & 2011 both very crimson colour, 2011 transparent, 2010 darker. Both very Pinot Noir nose, 2011 lighter in intensity. Very good length and ripe fruit, 2010 more density. On balance, 2010 the bigger wine, 2011 lighter perhaps a bit more elegant.\n\nGriottes Chambertin Grand Cru, Domaine/Maison Roche de Bellene\n\n2011 darker in colour crimson red; bouquet in both very fine Pinot perfume. Very good fruit in both. Both very close, on balance 2010 slightly bigger.\n\nClos Vougeot Grand Cru, Louis Jadot\n\nBoth similar crimson colour; exhibiting very good ripe fruit, 2010 denser, very fine acidity in both. 2010 bigger wine, 2011 lighter and very attractive.\n\nNuits St-Georges 1er cru Clos de la Marechale, JF Mugnier\n\n2011 and 2010: Same dark-ruby colour in both, very little to choose between the two. Both very ripe fruit, 2010 perhaps richer with good minerality.\n\nNuits St-Georges les Chaillots, Michel Gros\n\nBoth same dark ruby; lovely Nuits St-Georges character, particularly 2011. Very fine fruit and minerality especially 2010. Little to choose between the two.\n\nGevrey-Chambertin, Pacalet\n\nBoth had a touch of brown in otherwise deep red, light Pinot nose. Dense ripe fruit in both but lacking a little in freshness.\n\n2011 was found to be better than 2010.\n\nVosne-Romanee, Michel Gros\n\nDark ruby-red in both, attractive Pinot nose in 2010; very ripe fruit in both but needed airing to bring out. On balance 2011 had the edge on 2010.\n\nVosne-Romanee 1er cru Les Brulees, Michel Gros\n\nBoth very good in colour, nose and fruit. Very little to choose between the two, both very good examples of the character of their respective vintages.\n\nVosne-Romanee 1er cru Clos des Reas, Michel Gros\n\nThe flagship wine of Michel Gros. Both vintages typical and excellent examples of their individual character. Very dark ruby colours, fine Pinot aromas still rather shy in 2010, both are big wines, mouth-filling juicy fruit, 2010 perhaps a tiny bit more intense.\n\nVosne-Romanee 1er cru Les Malconsorts, Dujac\n\nBoth very similar, dark colours, both very fine, big, powerful seductive wines, difficult to choose between the two, 2011 perhaps showing a touch more minerality.\n\nClos St Denis Grand Cru, Roche de Bellene\n\nBoth showed dark ruby red colour, lovely pure Pinot nose, very refined; lots of good ripe fruit in both, both were a little short on finish.\n\nClos de la Roche Grand Cru, Roche de Bellene\n\nDark ruby-red colour in both and fine delicate Pinot aromas. Good fruit in both, 2011 very intense dense solid wine, 2010 showed a trace of umami even. Both similarly slightly short finish.\n\nChambertin Grand Cru 2010, Chateau Marsannay\n\nDeep red with a touch of brown, surprising for its age. Good Pinot fruit with distinct tinge of savouriness. A bit short, may improve with age.\n\nChambertin Clos de Beze Grand Cru, Faiveley\n\nVery dark ruby-red in both, 2010 showing just a touch of tawniness; both showed very good Pinot aroma.\n\nLots of very ripe fruit in both, very solid, very long. 2011 showed touch of savouriness (umami). Very little to choose between the two.\n\nBonnes Mares Grand Cru, Comte Georges de Vogue\n\nBoth dark ruby-red, 2011 perhaps a little darker; very fine Pinot perfume from both wines.\n\nVery ripe fruit in both, 2011 a little more open, 2010 very closed and backward, almost stern in character, very much in character. Rather \"yin and yang\" in comparison and contrast.\n\nGrands Echezeaux 2010, Domaine Romanee-Conti\n\nSurprisingly beginning to show brown tints in the otherwise red colour. Very fine Pinot perfume - ripe strawberries, light touch of citrus - very ripe fruit, but very youthful showing a little roughness around the edges.\n\nVery very long, very powerful wine.\n\nMusigny Grand Cru, Comte Georges de Vogue\n\nDeep purple-red and very fine Pinot perfume in both; lots of very ripe fruit in both, 2011 perhaps showing a touch more acidity. Very good length in both. 2011 very Musigny character, 2010 more backward, deeper richer fruit, will need more time. Both extraordinary, ultimate Pinot wines.\n\nMusigny Grand Cru, JF Mugnier\n\nBoth beautiful wines, deep purple-red colours, very refined Pinot perfume for bouquets; 2011 big volume very ripe closed; 2010 very complex, very ripe. Both very fresh and very long finish. Impossible to choose between any of these Musignys!\n\nThus endeth the reading as they say - what a surfeit of riches indeed.\n\nSumming up\n\nAn extensive tasting of white and red, across the board , from Cote de Beaune and Cote de Nuits, from producers who included some of the most famous names in Burgundy, a truly representative showing. On balance, 2011 showed it is very close to 2010, just a little different. Like twins, close but not exact copies.\n\nI would buy both vintages, from the top producers if available, as much as I can get and can afford, and even if there's no storage space, would somehow make space for them, as this is a chance of a lifetime.\n\nAnd I would wait another five years at least before touching them.\n\nDisclaimer: I am involved in the distribution of Domaines JF Mugnier, Michel Gros, Bonneau du Martray, Comtes Lafon and Leflaive.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is aiming to garner about half of those orders, especially from growth markets such as Indonesia, India and IndoChina.\n\n\"The real opportunities in Asia is the number of new airlines looking at new markets. Low cost carriers have been great for us,\" said Mr Karlsson.\n\n\"We think 2014 is going to be pretty good. 2013 was a bit challenging,\" he added.\n\nCurrently, Bombardier has some 250 planes flying in the region, and over 300 planes on order from customers in Asia.\n\nIts upcoming single-aisle CSeries will aim to fill the gap in the 100-150 seat segment and could prove a popular choice among Asian carriers, he reckons. It will also pit Bombardier against the two biggest aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus, in terms of some of their smaller models.\n\n\"There's a really big gap between the turboprops - like the 86-seater - and the LCCs, which fly 180-seaters. That gap needs to be filled,\" he said. \"When we look at the data, the majority of sectors in Asia require about 100 to 150 seats.\"\n\nIt currently has firm orders for over 200 of the CSeries aircraft, which has seen its delivery date pushed back to the second half of next year.\n\nAs of yesterday, Bombardier had garnered orders and commitments for 17 aircraft worth up to US$852 million during the Singapore Airshow. Buyers included Abu Dhabi's Falcon Aviation Services which ordered two Q400 turboprop aircraft.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Scheduled to open in 2017, it will have three hotels with more than 2,500 rooms, including a luxury hotel in partnership with Italian fashion house Gianni Versace SpA.\n\nThe company founded by Macau tycoon Stanley Ho is expanding in Cotai, Asia's version of the Las Vegas Strip, to catch up with companies including Sands China Ltd and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd that have resorts there. SJM, which runs 20 of Macau's 35 casinos, is the last of the Chinese city's six operators to get government approval to build on the isthmus of reclaimed land that links the islands of Coloane and Taipa.\n\n\"We made the HK$25 billion estimate about a year ago,\" Ambrose So, chief executive officer of SJM Holdings, said at the press conference in Macau. \"Now that the costs of construction materials and labour have risen, we believe a HK$30 billion price tag is more realistic.\"\n\nLisboa Palace will initially be built on a 70,500-square-metre (760,000- square-foot) site. The company plans to buy a stake in a neighbouring plot controlled by Angela Leong, SJM's executive director and a Macau legislator, to triple the size of the resort, chief executive officer Ambrose So had said. The company will finalise the deal within this year, he said yesterday.\n\nThe resort was modelled after Versailles, according to WATG, the US- based architectural design company employed for SJM's project. Sands China's Venetian Macao is modelled after the Italian city as is its parent's Las Vegas casino, which was also designed by WATG.\n\nA French theme \"resonates well\" with customers from mainland China, Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst at Union Gaming Group, said in a research note yesterday. \"Mainland consumers view Europe in general and France in specific as very aspirational destinations.\"\n\nThe 180,000-square-metre expansion site, which has been approved for non-gambling entertainment use, is owned by a company controlled by Ms Leong, who is also the mother of Mr Ho's youngest children. Mr Ho, 92, held a casino monopoly in Macau for four decades until 2002, when the government issued licences to overseas operators such as Sands and Wynn Resorts.\n\nSJM is following the competitors, which built restaurants, malls and family-friendly attractions in their resorts to draw middle-class holiday-makers from mainland China to Macau.

The company will invest as much as US$100 million in resorts and other tourism-related property in Norway, he announced.\n\n\"The tourism industry in Norway is probably more mature\" than in Iceland, Mr Huang said in a phone interview from Beijing. \"Our commitment in Nordic countries is not changed. We plan to enter one or two countries first and then expand to the rest of Northern Europe, while we don't mind waiting for Iceland.\"\n\nMr Huang first proposed the project in Iceland in 2011 as a launchpad for investments elsewhere in the Nordic region. The new Icelandic government, which was elected in April 2013, is reviewing investment laws that had blocked his previous bids. Mr Huang's company, one of the first Chinese developers investing abroad, said in 2011 it planned to develop the resort and mountain park on 300 square kilometres of land.\n\n\"Northern European countries are actually still very conservative,\" Mr Huang pointed out. \"They think Chinese investors are those nouveau riche who buy out everything everywhere. If it takes time for the investment, then we'll just do it slowly.\"\n\nMr Huang's connection with Iceland started 30 years ago when he was studying at Peking University, he said in 2011. His roommate and good friend back then was from the volcanic island and later married a politician. Mr Huang donated US$1 million in 2010 to set up an Icelandic-Chinese poet-exchange programme.\n\nBeijing Zhongkun, who has properties in California and Tennessee, is also known for helping restore the 200-year-old villages of Xidi and Hongcun around Huangshan mountain in China's eastern Anhui province, which are now included on the Unesco world heritage list. The closely held company built and operates resorts near the villages, according to Beijing Zhongkun's website.\n\nMr Huang donated US$1.6 million to a museum in Norway in exchange for the return of seven marble columns from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing to China. It took six months to reach an agreement with the Norwegian museum, which needed funding for refurbishment, he said.\n\nThe columns, currently in the KODE Art Museums of Bergen, were bequeathed by a former Norwegian cavalry officer, Johan Wilhelm Normann Munthe, as part of a collection of 2,500 Chinese artifacts in the early 1900s, The New York Times reported on Feb 9.\n\nThey will be returned in September and placed at a museum at Peking University from where Mr Huang graduated, he said.\n\nMr Huang, who is a member of China's writers' association, has published several books of poetry.\n\n\"I felt very sentimental when I saw those relics in the museum and I think they should be returned to China,\" Mr Huang added. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

And Chudar by NUS Indian Instrumental Ensemble and NUS Indian Dance relate dramatic stories of the eternal courtship between the Hindu deity, Lord Shiva, and his consort, Goddess Parvati.\n\nThis year, there are 28 events held from March 14-29. -\n\nCHEAH UI-HOON\n\nFor more information and ticketing details on the NUS arts festival, please go to\n\nwww.nusartsfestival.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It may be more effective to address directly the rising costs of living that exacerbate income gaps, said participants at a pre-Budget roundtable organised by BT.\n\nWhile there have been suggestions to raise the top marginal personal income tax rate or broaden the income bracket for which the top rate applies, KPMG head of tax Tay Hong Beng and EY head of tax Chung-Sim Siew Moon both think such moves would be \"very difficult\".\n\nThat could send the wrong signal to the global talent that Singapore still hopes to attract, especially since comparisons are often made between Singapore's top marginal personal tax rate of 20 per cent and Hong Kong's 17 per cent.\n\nMrs Chung-Sim said: \"At this moment, we are very competitive. But any increase in the top marginal rate may put us into a not so competitive situation.\"\n\nMr Tay added that another consideration for policymakers would be the tax burden of the middle income group, sandwiched between those who earn little and benefit from transfers and those at the upper end of the payscale, but still pay taxes.\n\n\"It may not be a direct remedy on tax, but more about how we can make goods and services that are necessary more affordable.\"\n\nTo reduce inequality, the rising cost of living in Singapore must be addressed, Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan agreed.\n\n\"Perhaps we need to look at it from a demographics point of view as well. We have one of the most quickly ageing populations in Asia. Healthcare is one of the very crucial costs that has crept up,\" he said.\n\nHealthcare items, which carry a weight of 6 per cent in the consumer price index's basket of goods, saw a 3.8 per cent rise in prices in 2013 from 2012. This was driven by a 4 per cent rise in medical treatment costs and a 6.8 per cent increase in medical health insurance costs.\n\nThis compares to an overall inflation rate of 2.4 per cent in 2013, or core inflation of 1.7 per cent after accommodation and private transport costs are stripped out.\n\nMr Tay thinks that there is room to consider granting tax incentives to companies providing healthcare services or healthcare insurance providers too, that is, if their savings are translated into lower prices for consumers.\n\nTackling healthcare costs (Budget 2014 Pt 7)\n\nReducing inequality (Budget 2014 Pt 8)\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

It contributed 10.9 per cent to the firm's revenue in the 2013 financial year.\n\nThe main pressure on LionGold's bottom line, however, came from the dive in other income, which fell to $2 million year on year, from $21.9 million.\n\nThe firm made an unrealised loss on financial assets at fair value of $400,000, compared with a gain of $2 million a year earlier, and recorded a decrease in gains on its equity interest in a subsidiary as well as an acquisition.\n\nLionGold produced 8,559 ounces of gold in the quarter, compared with 13,846 ounces in Q2 and 9,431 ounces in Q1.\n\nThis was produced at a higher all-in sustaining cost of A$1,454 (S$1,652) an ounce, as the exceptional production in the previous quarter dropped. The gold was sold at A$1,361 an ounce.\n\nAs at the third quarter, LionGold held 7.5 million ounces of gold resources, 810,000 ounces of which were classified as reserves.\n\nFor the nine months, LionGold's revenue rose 26 per cent to $114.6 million. It made a loss of $53.8 million, compared with a profit of $627,000 a year ago.\n\nAmid volatile gold price which affect its revenue - gold spot price fluctuated between a low of US$1,186.68 and a high of US$1,352.63 during the quarter - the management is continually reviewing its operational process and managing factors such as its mining techniques, scale of operations and minimum cut-off ore grade to improve its overall financial performance, said LionGold.\n\nIt is looking to grow both organically and through acquisitions, with its projects in Ghana, Bolivia and Australia to bolster growth from mid-2014.\n\n\"Going forward, Signature Metals (in Ghana) will commence its tailings purchase and processing agreement, while Minera Nueva Vista (in Bolivia) begins its mine development in 2014 and production in late 2015/early 2016,\" said CEO Nicholas Ng.\n\nThe counter closed 0.2 of a cent lower at 13.3 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The region accounts for 11 per cent of the 2,200 Gulfstream aircraft in the air - versus just 3 per cent in 2003 - making it the second biggest region for the jet maker. About 20 of those planes are in Singapore.\n\nPopular models include those in the large-cabin segment - like the G450, G550 and G650 - where Gulfstream estimates it has a 50 per cent market share in the region.\n\n\"In the last five years, we've put a lot of emphasis on this region to expand it and support it,\" said Mr Sperry.\n\nSister company Jet Aviation - which was acquired by parent company General Dynamics - is in the process of expanding its operations in Singapore to triple its hangar size to accommodate five of Gulfstream's largest aircraft.\n\nGulfstream also recently expanded its sales office, which first opened in Singapore in 1988, moving it to the Marina Bay area.\n\nGulfstream's 104,000 square foot service centre in Beijing - a joint venture with Hainan Airlines - was launched in 2012 and services planes based in China.\n\nIt has also placed staff in the region - from areas such as technical assistance to call centres to warehousing of spare parts - to service its products.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Members of the four clubs will meet government agencies at separate briefing sessions on Sunday.\n\nAmong the four, the impact on SICC is deemed to be the most significant, as Keppel's golf course sits on land that had been reflected as a residential site as early as the Urban Redevelopment Authority's 2001 Concept Plan.\n\n\"Why at our expense? Why do we need to be the sacrificial lamb?\" said an SICC member, commenting on rumours that an SICC golf course will either be given to another club or made public. \"Because it sends a perceived right signal, that the government will show the common Singaporean that we don't act in cahoots with the rich. We are one of you.\"\n\nThe SICC, the largest golf club here with four 18-hole golf courses, is regarded as one of the most prestigious golf clubs, and its 7,800 members read like a \"who's who\" of high society.\n\nEconomists, however, believe that the competing needs for scarce land resources is the main reason behind decisions over the extension of golf course leases.\n\n\"There is a bonafide commercial and residential need that far outweighs the benefits of retaining a course,\" said Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan.\n\n\"If we just look at where their land is, both (SICC and Keppel's) are pretty prime land, whether you want to look at it as a residential or commercial land. It's not surprising that (the government) are rethinking what the land ought to be used for, particularly given the magnified pressures on land usage, and the kind of very rapid development that has come about.\"\n\nSeen from a purely economic perspective, it is about putting scarce resources to better use, said DBS economist Irvin Seah.\n\n\"There have been so many complaints on the ground about overcrowding. This shows that policymakers are listening,\" he said. With Singapore planning to accommodate a larger population of 6.9 million by 2030, more land will be needed, and these put to better use, he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's about balancing the needs of everyone from a political and economical standpoint,\" said CIMB economist Song Seng Wun. \"Finding a balance to a liveable city requires give and take.\"\n\nThe fact that the SICC is also affected also shows that the government is leaving no stone unturned in doing so, he added.\n\n\"It basically shows that the government considers everything and anything . . . it doesn't mean if you're a Tan Sri you'll get protected.\"\n\nBesides the consideration of alternative developments, a second priority for land planners in allocating space for golf course land is to ensure that there are sufficient courses accessible to the public.\n\nThe lease for the Marina Bay Golf Course - the only 18-hole public course - expires in 2024. It is zoned for commercial and residential uses under the Draft Master Plan released last year.\n\nMinLaw said on Tuesday that the minimum requirement is to have one 18-hole course available for public use, and that it will find a replacement site when the lease for the Marina Bay Golf Course runs out.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

In exchange, they are expected to embark on projects that involve substantial investments in Singapore, to help create new target industries or expand existing ones and create jobs for Singaporeans.\n\nWhile Chung-Sim Siew Moon and Tay Hong Beng, heads of tax at EY and KPMG respectively, acknowledged that the exact conditions imposed on tax exemptions are not made public, they emphasised the \"substantial\" nature of the government's requirements.\n\nSaid Mr Tay: \"Contrary to what a lot of people may be thinking, getting a tax incentive in Singapore is not very easy. (The government) wants to see a lot of substance (and it) wants to know what kind of value you are bringing to Singapore, what kind of environment you are creating. So I think it is never (the case that) incentives are given just for the sake of (it).\"\n\nWhile Mrs Chung-Sim thinks that providing full disclosure for every case would result in \"an overload of information\", she thinks government agencies could make public the minimum conditions imposed on companies. The heightened transparency, she says, would provide assurance that the tax incentives are indeed beneficial to the economy, and are in the public's interest.\n\nSaid Ms Sim: \"EDB (the Economic Development Board) or IE Singapore (could) lay down clearly what are the conditions - at least the minimum conditions - that are required to attain a certain tax incentive.

The average price for the initial phase could be in the range of $950-$1,150 psf.\n\nChief executive Cheang Kok Kheong noted that a slight premium to UOL Development's Riverbank @ Fernvale project would be \"considered as fair\" for the waterfront view that the project offers.\n\nCompeting development Riverbank @ Fernvale, which has also opened its showflats, has an average price indication of slightly more than $1,000 psf.\n\n\"You are buying your view to the reservoir until the leasehold ends,\" Mr Cheang said on Monday at a media preview of the project.\n\n\"We are selling to customers who are appreciative of the long-term value,\" he added, pointing to the quality finishings such as the marbled and timbered floors and other features of the project.\n\nThe Frasers Centrepoint-led consortium paid $533 psf for Rivertrees' 99-year leasehold site in June last year, a shade higher than UOL's $489 psf for the Riverbank site in April last year.\n\nRivertrees Residences is expected to be completed in 2018. It overlooks the Sungei Punggol reservoir and boasts a 150-metre reservoir frontage that is said to be the widest among all developments in the area.\n\nNinety-two per cent of the 495 units will have views of the reservoir as the apartment blocks are spread out in a crescent shape facing the reservoir to maximise residents' view of the reservoir, while more than 80 per cent will have views of the 50-metre swimming pool.\n\nThe residential units comprise a mix of one- and two-bedroom suites, three- and four-bedroom units, \"TRIO Homes\" that have dual-key and inter-generation designs, as well as \"Prive Homes\" that come with private lift lobbies. There will also be a shop unit to serve the residents.\n\nThe project has eight \"Cove Houses\", which are duplex three-bedroom strata-titled landed homes. Mr Cheang said that apart from Sentosa Cove, these \"Cove Houses\" are the only waterfront landed homes in Singapore and the hook is that they are each selling for under $2 million. Permanent residents will need to obtain approval from the Land Dealings Unit under the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to qualify.\n\nOne key project feature is the \"River Villa\", which is fully fitted with living and dining areas, as well as a bathroom, pull-out bed and adjacent outdoor spa. It can serve as an option for visiting family members and friends to stay over or as a function room.\n\nUndaunted by the government measures to cool the property market, Mr Cheang said: \"Although the market is narrower, there is still the depth there. People who want to buy . . . and don't have to worry about the loans or are buying a second home are still in the market.\"\n\nIn a low interest rate and uncertain environment, home ownership still offers a choice asset for investors seeing growth in Singapore, Mr Cheang added, noting that more than a thousand people viewed the showflats during the project's soft opening the last weekend.\n\nHe conceded that the market is more cautious now than six months ago and this would mean that the sales team \"needs to go to the market more aggressively\".\n\nResponding to media queries on the temporary granite shortage in Singapore due to a disruption in granite supply from Indonesia, Mr Cheang said this is unlikely to affect the timeline of the project as Indonesian granite accounts for 25-30 per cent of Singapore's supply, among other sources such as Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nFrasers Centrepoint will soon be announcing plans for a mixed-use 99-year leasehold commercial and residential plot at Yishun Central, where it put in a top bid of $1.4 billion - a whopping 47 per cent higher then the second-highest bid.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has quite a few features in its favour: strong regulation, well capitalised banks and a well established legal framework. Its central location in Asia where wealth creation is expected to be prodigious also helps. Yet, success cannot be taken for granted. Already the industry has seen a number of exits and mergers and acquisitions, which are disruptive to some degree for clients. In 2009, ING sold its Asian private bank business to OCBC, which resulted in the creation of the Bank of Singapore. In 2012, Bank of America sold its Asian and European private bank business to Bank Julius Baer. Now, Societe Generale is divesting its Asian wealth management business.\n\nMore consolidation may be on the cards, particularly as the industry's dynamics appear to favour larger banks with economies of scale. Smaller banks should take stock. High business costs such as rentals are fairly easy to anticipate, and so is the cost of talent. One big additional challenge is regulation and compliance, where costs are expected to rise. But perhaps a far larger challenge is the scramble for client assets in a wealth market that may well be overbanked. The asset threshold at which a bank achieves critical mass is said to be US$20 billion. Wealthy individuals are likely to have as many as three to five banks. If so, they are unlikely to shift assets along with every job change that their relationship manager may secure. Some banks say that they have veered away from the practice of hiring based on the book of clients an adviser promises to bring in. This is a good trend and should inject rationality in a market where manpower accounts for a disproportionate share of costs.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group notes in its 2013 global wealth report that Asia-Pacific banks' performance have shown \"significant improvement\" in terms of return on assets and cost-to-income ratios. Still, pre-tax profit margins are among the lowest globally at 20 per cent. The way forward is to eke out more efficiencies, a tall order when regulation is increasing and clients' preference is for simplicity and transparency.\n\nBanks will have to review their business projections and segment their client base carefully. Ultra wealthy clients are desirable, but margins in that segment are thin. Clients in the lower wealth bands are likely to have less complex needs, and are more likely to go for managed products that offer regular income streams. Banks will also need to prepare for a time when product commissions may cease to be feasible, either due to regulation or client preference. A new business model based on advisory fees should be considered. New sources of revenue are also possible from independent asset managers and family offices which will need to tap bank platforms for transactions. As for staff costs, judicious hiring is key, as are efforts to retain existing staff. Growth prospects are bright for wealth managers, but more so for those who can deliver stability and continuity.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The deal would be US$5.88 billion at list prices if all options are exercised.\n\nPaulo Cesar Silva, president and chief executive officer of Embraer Commercial Aviation, said E-Jets have the proven ability to stimulate traffic and provide affordable air travel to people in emerging markets.\n\n\"I see the domestic Indian market developing in a similar way with both the current E-Jets and of course the E2s,\" he said.\n\nAir Costa, which began commercial operations last October, leases four current-generation E-Jets. It plans to lease around three more pre-owned E-190s each year until the new planes start arriving in 2018, the company said.\n\nAir Costa's first E-190 E2 will be delivered in 2018, with the first E195 E2 to arrive only in 2019. They will seat between 98 and 118 passengers.\n\nRamesh Lingamaneni, chairman of Air Costa, said the company's initial experience with their current E-Jets was very positive.\n\n\"The E2s will give us the right-sized seat capacity for us to cater to the future target markets and unit costs that are competitive with larger re-engined single aisle aircraft,\" he said.\n\nPratt and Whitney's PurePower Geared Turbofans will provide power for the new aircraft.\n\nEmbraer's second-generation E-Jets were launched in Paris last year. This transaction raises the total E-Jet E2 orders to 200 firm, with another 200 on options.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Personal consumption has risen more strongly but much of this is in advance of an increase in consumption tax due in April, while wage increases to support consumption beyond then have been lacking.\n\nBetter economic momentum over the past year has come partly from aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, Mr Schiff noted. This turned chronic deflation into a one per cent annual inflation rate last year, and as long as inflation keeps moving towards the 2 per cent target, there is no need for further stimulus, he suggested.\n\nMomentum has also been provided through fiscal stimulus, much of which is funded by increased purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) by the BOJ. While the central bank could purchase even more JGBs, this would be risky until the government publishes \"concrete\" mid-term plans to cut its deficit, Mr Schiff suggested.\n\nEconomists predict that personal consumption, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of gross domestic product, will slow once buying in advance of the consumption tax increase goes back to normal. This will leave external demand as the chief engine of growth unless companies increase basic wages.\n\n\"We believe a slump in domestic demand likely to follow a buying rush ahead of a scheduled rise in consumption tax will pressure the performance of many Japanese industrials,\" Standard & Poor's credit analyst Hiroki Shibata said yesterday. \"We remain cautious about prospects for a sustained solid recovery through 2014.\"\n\nMeanwhile, exports have \"not rebounded to the extent that we had hoped given the weaker yen\", Mr Schiff pointed out. This was partly due to slowing world trade growth, but also reflects the fact that Japanese exporters have not used the yen's weakness to cut prices and boost market share, he said.\n\nThe government has promised a further set of growth-enhancing measures for June and if these are convincing, they could improve business confidence to the point where corporate capital investment and wage payouts could begin to rise, Mr Schiff added.\n\nApparently responding to Mr Schiff's suggestion that the central bank should be ready to respond in the event that US tapering and problems in emerging markets result in financial turbulence, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda gave his assurance yesterday that it was ready to respond as needed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while he looks out for the right locations to open shop, the seasoned chef - who has been in the trade since he was 16 - plans to give Singaporeans a sneak preview in a three-day confectionery extravaganza this June. Fantasia by Escriba, to be held at the Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre, will celebrate all that is fantastical, dream-like and surreal, and all fashioned out of edible pastry.\n\nThink edible flowers, a 4m tall elephant made of sugar dancing in a chocolate waterfall, and clouds made of cotton candy. And yes, feel free to get up close and chomp on them. Escriba believes the event will be the first of its kind in the world both in terms of concept and scale. Besides showcasing over 30 sweet masterpieces made by the Escriba pastry team, the 8,000 sq m exhibition hall will also be divided into eight themed pavilions that visitors can enter and interact with. These include booths fashioned as a chocolate jungle, an haute couture boutique retailing edible jewelry, a chocolate theatre, a wedding-inspired tea room, a pastry research and development lab, and a 2,000 sq m playground designed for children.\n\nStaging Fantasia was a long-held dream shared between Mr Escriba and his wife Patricia. \"Pastry for us is surprise, creating emotions and creating small moments of happiness for people,\" says Mr Escriba, who was in town this week to promote the event. An Escriba academy will also be set up for aspiring pastry chefs to learn about sugar fondant, caramel, chocolate and pastry-making under visiting pastry chefs such as by Patricia Schmidt, Oscar Hernandez Viciana, Daniel Domniguez Rodellar and Oscar Hernandez Viciana. Mr Escriba will also handpick six promising local pastry chefs for a six-week apprenticeship at the Escriba Academy in Spain.\n\nFantasia by Escriba runs from June 27-29 at Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre, Halls A and B. Tickets priced at $38 for children aged 12 and below and at $58 for all others for the morning showcase (10am to 2pm). The evening showcase (4pm to 8pm) will cost $58 for kids aged 12 and below and $98 for all others. Midnight @ Fantasia, an 18-above event, will run on June 28 from 10pm to 1am. Tickets are priced at $188. Tickets are now available at\n\nwww.fantasiaescriba.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unfortunately for Winter's Tale, a passion project from screenwriter and producer Akiva Goldsman, the descent from box-office hopeful to major dud is mercilessly swift.\n\nWinter's Tale also marks Goldsman's directorial debut but while being panned by critics is not necessarily a deterrent to commercial success, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that there will be a happy ending here. Despite the connection to a critically acclaimed book - Winter's Tale is adapted from the well-regarded 1983 novel of the same name by Mark Helprin - and some heavyweight casting, the film is about as convincing as a Donald Trump hairdo. Or a three-dollar note. Or a flying horse and some cheesy special effects. Not coincidentally, a winged white stallion plays a significant role in Winter's Tale, which is an allegory - two interconnecting tales, actually - about a petty criminal's date with destiny. This love story, which aspires to inspire, is instead completely underwhelming.\n\nPart-fantasy, part-morality tale and all soap opera, the narrative has the standard ingredients in place: guardian angels against all-conquering demons, a damsel in distress, a handsome rogue, a New Year's Eve ball followed by the obligatory love scene and string-heavy soundtrack - and yes, that darned flying equine icon.\n\nGod works in mysterious ways, and Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), a small-time thief on the run from his former benefactor, a twitchy thug named Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe), isn't an obvious candidate for miracle worker - yet that's exactly what he is.\n\nPearly is a demon enforcer who has direct access to the ultimate authority on evil, meaning he had the upper hand in keeping early-20th-century New York City free from anything good - and Peter is in grave danger of doing some good.\n\nThe object of his attention - and affection - is Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay), a luminous young woman stricken with consumption and destined to die young, unless, of course, Peter can do something about it. \"I love blood in the snow, especially virgin blood,\" snarls Pearly during a memorable (for the wrong reasons) winner-take-all showdown with Peter. The story then jumps forward a century or so to the current day but the weird thing is, Peter hasn't aged a day and neither has Pearly.\n\nThe two of them have some unfinished business to attend to: in addition to the fight between Lucifer's dark forces and the good guys, there's the fate of a newspaper reporter (Jennifer Connelly) and her sick daughter (Ripley Sobo) to worry about and yes, the future of all humanity is also a major concern.\n\n\"Is it possible to love someone so completely that they simply can't die?\" asks Peter in a moment of utter despair. In Winter's Tale, anything's possible. \"Things don't always add up to the world we know,\" he reasons. Unfortunately, nothing in this movie adds up either. Only a miracle - or a flying horse - can save it.\n\nRating:\n\nC-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It makes commercial sense, since the rom-com audience is largely women.\n\nBut this Valentine season, the men - never one to enjoy being trounced by women in any field - are trying to muscle in on the market. And so, you get That Awkward Moment, Winter's Tale and A Case of You, romance movies told from the male perspective but still clearly intended for women audiences.\n\nIn That Awkward Moment, its central characters are Jason (Zac Efron), Daniel (Miles Teller) and Mikey (Michael B Jordan) - three young men in New York who have decided to stay single and play the field till they hit 30.\n\nHandsome Jason has a roster of girlfriends he can meet for no-strings-attached trysts. Cunning Daniel gets his best female buddy Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) to befriend women and then introduce them to him. And earnest Mikey, newly divorced from his cheating wife, is just learning to date again.\n\nWith the amount of macho locker-room banter and cheap hook-ups that take place in the early part of the movie, one wonders how this movie is suitable for Valentine's Day, supposedly the most romantic day of the year.\n\nBut then something happens midway through. The men fall unexpectedly and desperately in love - despite the fact that they've always hated \"that awkward moment\" when a woman asks a man if he's ready for a commitment. From here on, the only awkward moments you see are the mushy, weepy, cute-sy displays of affection that seems so out-of-character for at least two of these men.\n\nWhen Mikey stands at the door begging his cheating ex-wife to tell him she still loves him, when Jason improvises a perfect love poem for his new girlfriend (Imogen Poots), and when Daniel suddenly falls for his best girl buddy who's been by his side all this time, you realise why this movie is intended for women all along.\n\nIt offers comfort and assurance to women by telling them that all men - from the brazen womaniser and the shameless commitment-phobe to the garden-variety sex addict - really just want to fall in love.\n\nIn other words, don't give up - that handsome jerk who's dated every girl, except you, might just turn around someday and say, \"It's you I've loved all along.\" (As a man, I assure you, this almost never happens.)\n\nAs an objective reviewer, I give this movie a C on account of its decent performances and occasionally good jokes. But if I were a woman, I'd give it a straight F for giving false hopes.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Your sticky nian gao-eating Lordship, please reconsider. Lovebirds in the Chinese festival-observing countries of Asia implore you to spare a thought for their feelings. You have 364 days to choose from.

Regardless of how you say it, there is nothing romantic about the line, 'Honey, how about one last lohei?'\"\n\n\"Oh don't be such a cry-baby,\" scoffed the God of Fortune disdainfully. \"You're just jealous that people would choose prosperity over romance any time. I and the Kitchen God decided this a long time ago and we're not going to change our minds just because a small fry like you kicks up a fuss!\"\n\n\"Who you calling a small fry? Or a cry-baby?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said the God of Fortune, swelling up to his full height, including that of his hat. \"What you gonna do about it, diaper boy? Kill me with your bow and arrow?\"\n\n\"It's not that kind of bow, you idiot. And don't try to bully me, just shows you're a cowardly chicken.\"\n\n\"If you were a chicken I would beat you with a stick until you shriek.\"\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, settle down,\" interrupted the Kitchen God. \"Let's not get all worked up, alright? Let's just try to find an amicable solution...\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, it's too late,\" said Cupid in an ominous tone. \"I think the online community has got wind of this... the vigilantes...\" His eyes opened wide. \"I think they're after you!\"\n\n\"The what?\" shouted the God of Fortune as his smartphone started buzzing furiously. \"What's going on? Why am I being threatened all of a sudden? Hey, that's my address, that's private, how did they get that information! Why are they telling everybody to go to my house and destroy my hat? What's wrong with my hat?\"\n\n\"Stop them!\" hissed the Kitchen God.\n\n\"I can't,\" said Cupid. \"I don't know who they are. They're anonymous. They're vicious.\"\n\n\"Hello? Hello?\" The God of Fortune was shouting into his phone. \"Mother-in-law? No, I didn't give out your address. What do you mean there's a mob outside your house saying that I stole money from River Hong Bao? I'm innocent, don't believe them! Lohei party of all the community deities tonight? Yes, yes of course I'm going, I wouldn't miss it for the world. They withdrew my invitation? Wh-Why? Shrieking chicken? Come on, that was just a joke, I didn't mean it. Cupid help me, of course I wouldn't beat you with a stick, please, please, do something!\" \"You've got a bow and arrow, don't you?\" said the Kitchen God. \"You're the patron saint of love, aren't you? Do something!\"\n\nCupid sighed. \"He doesn't deserve it. But ok. Just get out of his line of vision or he's going to think you're Lady White Snake and fall in love with you.\" And with that, he released an arrow and with a puff of smoke, the God of Fortune's phone went silent, and so did he.\n\n\"So, where were we?\" he asked in an amiable tone. \"Were you talking about not having Valentine's Day and Chap Goh Mei on the same day? I understand. Sorry we couldn't avoid it this year, but we'll make sure it doesn't happen next year. Ok, got to go, bye.\"\n\nCupid looked stunned. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" said the Kitchen God. \"I think something happened with your arrow. When it hit, the first thing he saw was a chicken. And if I'm not mistaken, I think that chicken is following him right now. And it's carrying a big stick...\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This would place more emphasis on tangible outcomes that ultimately boost output.\n\nExplaining how attempts to measure productivity (such as unit labour cost) are \"flawed to begin with\", Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan said: \"There is a risk that productivity and creativity could be almost mutually exclusive, if not slightly at odds at the very least. If productivity is measured within the year (as) how much more output you can have, (it does) to some extent exclude the creative process that may have a longer gestation period.\n\n\"The way to go about it is to not get hung up on year-to-year measures, (whether they reflect) slippages or spurts in productivity. We're in it for the long haul, and I think we ought to treat it as such,\" he added.\n\nOther panellists shared their views on how recent curbs on foreign labour - aimed at heightening productivity - have sometimes had the opposite effect.\n\nKu Swee Yong, chief executive of property consultancy firm Century 21, noted the difficulty some of his clients have faced when trying to renew their foreign hires' employment passes - some of whom have worked in Singapore for half a decade.\n\n\"This is a complete drag on productivity, especially when it (has to do with) skilled labour (in sectors like) healthcare or engineering. To retrain (a new) person to understand our standards and how our environment works (is counterproductive),\" said Mr Ku.\n\nSingapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) chief executive Phillip Overmyer agreed, voicing multinational companies' (MNCs) frustrations at having to lose long-serving foreign staff due to tightened hiring measures.\n\n\"(Large multinationals) are more and more seriously saying: 'If this is something that's getting in my way, I shouldn't be here',\" said Mr Overmyer.\n\nBoth he and Mr Ku believe that instead of turning down such renewal applications, the government should facilitate them - this would function as a reward to companies that have trained their staff from the ground up.\n\nBeyond the issue of productivity, however, KPMG's head of tax Tay Hong Beng believes firms should not forget about value-creation activities either. These include building a strong brand, or attempts to internationalise.\n\nSaid Mr Tay: \"A lot of companies, especially SMEs (small and medium- sized enterprises), have been very focused on productivity, (and that) has taken away their focus (on) longer-term perspectives - how they can explore new markets, identify new capabilities, and embark on the innovation journey altogether. But if you look at creating value itself - beyond the (issue) of productivity - you could possibly be creating demand for your services and products.\n\n\"So can we expand the output rather than just look at narrowing the input? If we look at it from that perspective, then maybe the government can look into how we can help businesses in Singapore build their brands, or whether we can possibly introduce certain tax incentives to incentivise self-generated brands,\" said Mr Tay.\n\nPanellists also said that more can be done to encourage SMEs to expand beyond Singapore's small domestic market, since this would enable firms to enjoy greater economies of scale.\n\nEY's head of tax, Chung-Sim Siew Moon, thinks the government can do this by allowing all foreign-sourced income to be fully exempt from tax, by removing qualifying conditions. At present, foreign income remitted into Singapore is exempt from tax only if it has been subject to taxes overseas, and if the country's headline tax rate is at least 15 per cent or more.\n\nBoosting productivity (Budget 2014 Pt 2)\n\nAre manpower policies a drag on productivity?

A further six stores are expected to open in the second half of FY2014 in Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. These six stores have a total gross floor area of 67,433 square metres.\n\n\"Discretionary retail spending in Malaysia remains resilient despite significant headwinds to consumer sentiment, while retail spending in Indonesia continues to be strong. The group anticipates gradual improvement in discretionary retail spending in Vietnam in the second half of FY2014,\" said Parkson.\n\n\"Local currency weakness in the countries where the group operates remains a risk to the group's financials, which are presented in Singapore dollars. However, the group is of the view that operating results will improve,\" it added.\n\nNet asset value per share as at Dec 31, 2013, was 37 cents, compared with 38 cents in end-June last year.

One is part of a triple bill for the opening show, while the other premiered in Jakarta last year.\n\nMusing on the similarities and differences between martial arts and dance, Kitamura notes how the purpose of the former is efficiency and the intent to win, while in dance, the beauty is often in the \"showiness\" and lacks a concrete purpose.\n\nBut both are sophisticated and about communication between bodies - so they're very similar in that sense. In Japan, the distinctions between martial arts and dance are, in fact, quite blurred, she says.\n\n\"There are very similar movements in karate and kabuki, for example, and 'laido' which uses the sword, which is now very popular in Japan as a way to cultivate calmness, good balance and beautiful form.\"\n\nIn Okinawa, traditional karate also has very similar forms with their traditional dance.\n\n\"But what's interesting is the differences in the process when the people try to develop the technique and expression,\" she shares, and the development of martial arts strategy is a great way to look at choreography and dance technique as well. \"Sometimes it is as if they are solving mathematics and calculating energy flow, and from this, a new 'vocabulary' will emerge. It's very creative, like dance,\" shares Kitamura.\n\n\"In Perisai Diri, the basic concept is self-defence and the idea is to use the opponent's energy to win - which gave me inspiration to create dance movements out of that,\" she describes.\n\nKitamura was also fascinated with Sundanese Pencak silat like Panglipur and Minangkabau silat. \"Silat has a very clear concept of self-defence and each party develops its own fighting strategy. But for them, to win is sometimes to continue to fight rather than injuring the opponent - and that thinking is fascinating.\"\n\nChoreographing contemporary dance, for Kitamura, has become a way to harness that energy flow between bodies - derived from what she's observed in silat. \"It's also a good experience to work with the dancers who have traditional techniques,\" she adds.\n\nHer dance, To Belong - Cyclonicdream, considers how the spirit and the body are impacted by science and technology.\n\nIt was conceptualised by Kitamura in collaboration with leading Indonesian artists, including dramaturg/co-director Yudi Ahmad Tajudin (artistic director, Teater Garasi in Yogyakarta), and a team of Japanese artists. The dance production will have a narrative, and be presented with elements of wayang kulit, along with inspirations of aikido and jujutsu, besides silat. For the NUS performance, there will be changes in the presentation and staging.\n\nJapanese contemporary dance has few roots in Japanese traditional dance, except perhaps Butoh, but in the true spirit of contemporary art which is borderless, Kitamura used traditional Indonesian martial arts to make something new out of the old.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding advertising and rentals, rail would have turned in a loss of $5.8 million for 2013.\n\nExcluding start-up costs for the Downtown Line, ComfortDelGro reported that operating profit for its North East Line would have increased by 22.5 per cent to $13.6 million in 2013.\n\nThe taxi business showed modest growth, with operating profit increasing 3.6 per cent to $146.2 million.\n\nLooking ahead, ComfortDelGro expects cost pressures to persist.

This would record effective rents rather than contractual ones, providing greater transparency for SMEs and their landlords, ASME president Kurt Wee said at BT's Budget Roundtable.\n\n\"There is a need for better transparency . . . We think that in the institutional landlord space, we are seeing signs of a bit of a cartel in operation. Because we do have limited real estate space in Singapore and, very often, we're hearing anecdotes of very draconian measures on individual tenants by institutional landlords,\" he said.\n\nThe report that ASME is working on could then form the basis of recommendations for a code of best practices for industrial and commercial landlords.\n\n\"You know, we've imposed the lemon law on business, we imposed the Do-Not-Call registry on business. We wonder if we should impose some better practice in this space. How is a business supposed to react when they want to renew their lease and are told they are going to face a 300-400 per cent increase in rent?\" he said.\n\nThis is especially so given the current cost climate. Wage bills have swelled due to higher foreign worker levies and stricter quotas, while global commodity costs have been on the rise and minor compliance costs are adding up, Mr Wee added.\n\nSo it is local SMEs which are feeling the heat the most - calls for help with the affordability of business space have grown louder both in and outside Parliament in recent months.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (Reits) - some of which were formed after JTC and HDB divested space to private owners - have been blamed for shorter lease renewals and sharper spikes in rentals. \"That is not to say that Reits are bad. I think Reits are good because Reits have also redistributed wealth in various and positive ways as well. But we think that there are certain practices that need to be improved, so that there is a better balance between business and landlords,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nFor instance, ASME intends to question the practice of retail landlords collecting a percentage of turnover rung up at the tills as rent, on top of base rents. \"Although it is globally practised, we probably are going to question this issue of linking point-of-sales systems to landlords,\" he said.\n\nThese concerns over business space rents are not new - they were raised in Parliament last October. But they remain, even as several rounds of administrative measures to cool the property market - along with rising supply and the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework - seem to have had some impact on official rental and price indices.\n\nThis has led to suggestions from property players that it may be time to tweak the property cooling measures. Century21 CEO Ku Swee Yong said at the roundtable that he does not expect major changes.\n\n\"If every quarter, property valuations drop islandwide by 2 per cent, such that over the course of the year we have a 8-10 per cent decline, I think that sort of gradual decrease doesn't hurt the banks' balance sheets, doesn't really hurt families' balance sheets - because over the course of the year, they are also paying down their loans. That sort of a stalemate, sideways situation, the government is probably very comfortable with.\"\n\nIt is the potential hike in interest rates as the US Federal Reserve rolls back its quantitative easing (QE) programme that the government will be watching, he said. When that happens, and Singapore's interest rates rise in tandem with rates in the US, the authorities may then remove a portion of the curbs put in place so far.\n\nAre Reits bad?

At the same time, the group has three development sites - in Lorong K Telok Kurau, Tampines Road and Kuala Lumpur - with a total gross floor area of 503,365 sq ft for development.\n\n\"We'll look for further opportunities to acquire land plots in Singapore and abroad and with our strong cash position, we're well placed for potential growth,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nIn Singapore, the group will be \"very selective in identifying suitable sites that will appeal mainly to the mid to mass market segments\", he added.\n\nAlthough Roxy touched on its Hong Kong investment at 8 Russell Street opposite the famous Times Square, it did not reveal sales details.\n\nHowever, it is widely known in Hong Kong that the joint venture between CLSA Capital Partners and Roxy that acquired the upper floors in the 999-year leasehold building, has found buyers for 14 of the 21 strata retail floors of 4,718 sq ft each.\n\nThe average price is said to be close to HK$30,000 (S$4,900) psf. An earlier BT article stated a back-of-the-envelope calculation estimating Roxy's profit at HK$350 million for its 30 per cent in the venture - assuming HK$30,000 psf average price on the 21 floors.\n\nThe space is currently occupied by Shama Serviced Apartments, which will cease operations in the building. Assuming the assets are spruced up and the units handed over to the buyers by year-end, Roxy should be able to book its profit from the venture for FY2014.\n\nIn Singapore, the group's fully sold Spottiswoode 18, Centropod@ Changi and Space@Kovan are expected to receive TOP this year.\n\nThe group is recommending 1.297 cents per share final dividend, taking the total payout for FY2013 to 1.913 cents - up from 1.2752 cents for FY2012.\n\nRoxy's net asset value per share rose to 27.62 cents at end-2013, up from 21.25 cents at end-2012. Earnings per share increased to 7.73 cents in FY2013 from 4.90 cents in FY2012. The counter ended unchanged at 60.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So, when Mohammad Taghavian started looking for a new home four years ago, he knew exactly where he wanted to be.\n\nThe housing market, however, wasn't so cooperative. Mr Taghavian, a 47-year-old engineer, jumped at any property that came on the market, only to find that whatever he bid, he was \"edged out by a cash offer\", he says.\n\nHe did what a keen home buyer would do. Mr Taghavian kept raising his offer, from US$600,000 to over a million. That placed him in jumbo mortgage territory - above US$625,500 in his part of the country, and above US$417,000 in lower-priced areas.\n\nHis real estate agent, Michael Salas of Coldwell Banker, homed in on one development and went on a letter-writing spree to about 60 homeowners with ocean views. When a US$1.4 million townhouse finally came on the market last year, Mr Taghavian snagged it.\n\nHe moved into his dream home just before the new year.\n\nFor buyers such as Mr Taghavian who are looking at luxury properties that require jumbo mortgages, 2014 is already a banner year, industry specialists say.\n\nInterest rates on jumbo mortgages used to tower over conventional mortgages because they are considered riskier. But the rates for jumbos have dropped because of economic conditions, and are now almost on a par with conventional mortgages - or sometimes even lower.\n\nIn addition, new federal regulations that went into effect in January don't apply to jumbos, making them more flexible for buyers who want things such as interest-only loans or who have a high net worth but complicated finances.\n\nThis convergence of factors is helping move along the housing market recovery, says Harvey Grossberg, membership director of the National Association of Mortgage Professionals.\n\nBecause jumbo mortgages are so enticing, they are luring home buyers to consider \"move-up\" purchases, which, in turn, frees up inventory at the lower end of the market. \"It's just been a great situation where you had a combination of low interest rates and appreciation,\" says Mr Grossberg.\n\nThe typical spread between jumbos and conventional mortgages is a quarter of a percentage point or less, compared to a half point or more in 2010.\n\nFor instance, Mr Grossberg, who brokers mortgages in the Orange County area of California, recently completed two refinancings for a client who had a main residence and a resort property, one a jumbo mortgage now at 4.75 per cent, and the other, a conventional one at 4.5 per cent.\n\nIn some cases, the rate parity actually flips, and jumbo mortgages are actually lower, depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower and the length of the loan.\n\nUntil recently, banks kept jumbo mortgages on their balance sheets, instead of selling them on a secondary market.\n\nTom Wind, executive vice-president of home lending for EverBank Financial Corp which originated US$800 million of jumbo loans in the fourth quarter of 2013, says that this is happening because banks keep jumbo mortgages on their balance sheets, instead of selling them on a secondary market. With interest rates low, banks are luring buyers with discounts of an eighth of a percentage point or more.\n\nEven when buyers have enough cash, it can make sense to finance a home purchase with a jumbo mortgage.\n\nDenise Andres, a real estate agent for ERA Landmark in Bozeman, Montana, had a client who recently downsized from a US$3 million property to a US$1.2 million one, and got a jumbo mortgage at a 4.125 per cent interest rate on the purchase, instead of paying all cash. \"His thought was, with the gains in the stock market, why would I want to pay all cash if I can get 30-year money so low?\" she says.\n\nThe new qualified mortgage regulations, enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, require strict debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios, which determine how much mortgage one can afford and how much to put down. These and other stringent underwriting rules protect conventional mortgage borrowers and allow them to hold the banks accountable if there are problems down the line.\n\nJumbos don't have the same protections, and rules remain at the discretion of the lending institution.\n\nUnderwriting is still tough, because of the large loan risk, but banks can be more flexible with their offerings, says Joe Rogers, executive vice-president for Wells Fargo Home Mortgages, one of the largest jumbo lenders in the US.\n\nThis is especially useful for clients who might have variable or low W-2 income compared to their overall net worth, says Rhonda Hummel, a senior loan officer with First Capital Mortgage, in Newport Beach, California.\n\nSuch flexibility first stymied - then helped - Mr Taghavian. He got really frustrated when his lender repeatedly went over the value of his stock options, before eventually accepting them as a portion of his assets.\n\nAnother clause that aided Mr Taghavian was a \"departing residence\" exclusion, which meant he was able to rent his existing home and count 70 per cent of that income towards his bottom line. Otherwise, he would have had to sell the property, bought at the peak of the housing market, a time-consuming effort that wouldn't have netted him the profit he was after. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

In return for looking after unwed mothers (sinners of the worst order, as the film portrays them), the young women are made to work for years in a laundry and allotted only an hour a day to be with their babies.\n\nPhilomena's world is shattered when her three-year-old son is given away (for a fee) to adoptive parents from the United States. She has to relinquish all claims to the child but eventually marries and has a family of her own, burying her past for 50 years while wondering what happened to him and periodically trying to make contact. However, the nuns at the convent are unresponsive and deny any knowledge of her son's whereabouts.\n\nThat's when Sixsmith (played with admirable restraint by Coogan), a down-on-his-luck English journalist, hears of the story and reluctantly takes on an assignment to write a magazine article. Together with Philomena (Judi Dench), he embarks on a journey of discovery that takes them back to the convent, following a trail that leads across the Atlantic.\n\nThe wall of silence they encounter at the convent is frustrating but aided by the moral superiority of innocents in search of the truth - not to mention old home movies of a tousled-haired little boy happily at play - they eventually unearth a story of uncommon warmth. When it comes, the reveal of a life lost is both startling and beyond sad.\n\nPhilomena and Martin make for an odd couple and an unlikely pair of sleuths but one couldn't do without the other. For a story that has all the elements of tragedy, Philomena is ultimately about a triumph for a woman of courage.\n\n\"Have faith my dear, God will forgive you,\" says a priest to Philomena when she suffers a moment of doubt and weakness. The real question of course, is how she manages to forgive those who treated her so inhumanely.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are the lasting intangibles.\"\n\nYesterday was the 50th anniversary of the Housing & Development Board's Home Ownership for the People Scheme. The programme, introduced in 1964, offers subsidised mortgages to buyers of HDB flats. It has culminated in the Republic's high home ownership rate, where more than nine in 10 Singaporeans own a HDB flat. These apartments are home to more than 80 per cent of Singaporeans.\n\nMr Khaw said that former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had envisioned making Singapore a nation of home owners through the scheme. Pioneers such as then national development minister Lim Kim San helped turn this vision into reality.\n\nToday, a third generation of Singaporeans is embarking on their own home-ownership journey, and that desire to own a home has remained in the hearts of many Singaporeans, noted Mr Khaw.\n\nDuring the 'Our Singapore Conversation\" series of dialogue sessions held last year, an overwhelming 97 per cent of Singaporeans had said \"yes\" when asked if home ownership was still important to them. \"So the core purpose of housing the nation remains the same. HDB's mission remains critical and relevant.

Hint: better camera angle, lots of cleavage and picking the right target (that is, the breakdowns, not the frustrated commuters, mate!). Casey can teach Koh how to enjoy Singapore for what it is. Hint: be filthy rich so you live in Sentosa Cove - where each bungalow comes with maid's quarters that are bigger than that spare HDB room Koh was fighting with her aunty over.\n\nPinkerton match point\n\nHe: Woody Allen, the award-winning ageing filmmaker with a dubious sexual past\n\nShe: Wendi Deng, the leery Asian cougar whose mantra surely must be old is gold\n\nHOW they will hit it off: Woody Allen might not have Rupert Murdoch's wealth or Tony Blair's sexy body, legs and butt but one thing's for sure, age is on his side and that's going to make Wendi Deng all hot and bothered. His Asian fetish and her Pinkerton Syndrome make both of them a perfect match; whatever physique the geeky Allen lacks surely can be made up for by his filmmaking genius.\n\nThat should be enough to inspire the lovestruck teenager in her to pen another steamy missive in her hilariously broken \"Engrish\"; one that might read, \"Oh sh*t, oh sh*t, whatever why I'm so so missing Woody? Because he is so so charming but his clothes are so yucky and brown. He has old man smell, saggy butt and short... like my Lupert last time.

Sure, he's sorry now and asking to be punished (take away his licence; he could use the exercise anyway); but perhaps all that could have been prevented if he had an in-car GPS system pre-loaded with the OS that was featured in She. Long-distance drives will become less lonely with Scarlett Johansson's seductively husky and sexy voice providing company while giving directions. And like a real girlfriend, he'll only have himself to blame when she goes quiet and gives him the cold shoulder treatment when he lets road rage get the better of him.\n\nAn uninviting affair\n\nHe: Dr Tan Cheng Bock, presidential candidate who was recently uninvited from Istana Chinese New Year party\n\nHe: Ken Lim, owner of Don Quijote, a Spanish restaurant in Dempsey who dropped the F-bomb in an email reply to a customer who got turned away\n\nIF only he'd won the 2011 Presidential Elections, Dr Tan wouldn't have to lament missing out on this year's Istana Chinese New Year party which he was unceremoniously uninvited from at the eleventh hour.\n\nHe's probably a little sore about missing out on the red packet the Prime Minister was distributing to the Pioneer Generation (no loss, Dr Tan, there wasn't any cash in it; only two gold chocolate coins which some of the diabetic senior citizens complained they couldn't eat anyway) but at least, he didn't take to Facebook to shame the host... like one diner did after he was declined service at a Spanish restaurant in Dempsey and proceeded to email the owner about his experience.\n\nUnsatisfied with the reply he got, the latter published Don Quijote's owner Ken Lim's succinct eight-word response in full on Facebook to make him look like a Tapas Nazi. Both Dr Tan and Lim will have plenty to talk about over dinner regarding customer service and it can be held at the Indonesian VIP hospitality suite at the Singapore Air Show which we hear is unoccupied after the haze-starters too were struck off the guest list in the midst of a diplomatic row.\n\nSeeing red, but not roses\n\nHe: Alex Ferguson, the red-nosed ex-manager of Manchester United\n\nHe: David Moyes, the current red-faced manager of the Red Devils\n\nTHESE two will have plenty of catching up to do; with Moyes doing most of the talking probably as he tries to explain how he's undone Fergie's 26 years of hard work in just six months. Week in, week out, the Internet trolls have been hard at work with new howlers after each defeat - \"Be careful if you are driving past Old Trafford this week, a lot of people have been picking up three points there recently\"; \"A Manchester United lamp would make a nice birthday present because, like the team, it sits pretty in the middle of the table\"; \"It is so hard to win at Old Trafford because even Manchester United can't.\" Ironically, Moyes worked hard for 11 years trying to get his former team Everton to outperform their Merseyside rivals; with him in charge of the Red Devils now, it's finally happening.\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

JTC attributed the strong take-up in 2012 to the completion of the CleanTech One building.\n\nRBF returns, on the other hand, rose 18 per cent to 76,600 sq m last year. Most of the space returned - 47,400 sq m or 62 per cent - came from the standard factory segment, said JTC.\n\nThe occupancy rate of RBF also dipped from 2012 to 94.8 per cent last year, registering a demand of three million sq m against a supply of 3.2 million sq m - a \"healthy\" rate, according to JTC.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2013 alone, gross allocation of PIL reached 118.1 ha - JTC's highest since the second quarter of 2011. That for RBF was 13,500 sq m, down from 18,600 sq m in the third quarter.\n\nJTC's MedTech One and CleanTech Two buildings will be completed in the first and third quarters of this year. Aside from these, Fusionopolis' Towers A through C, as well as BioMed One and aeroSpace buildings, will be completed between 2014 and 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The average daily ridership increased by 3.4 per cent, but average fares declined, SBS reported.\n\nRail operations fell into a $5.8 million operating loss from an operating profit of $4.9 million a year ago as preparations for the start of the Downtown Line led to higher staff costs. Average daily ridership for the North-East Line gained 6.1 per cent, while the Light Rail Transit systems saw an 11.5 per cent increase in ridership.\n\nAdvertising operating profit also slumped by 13.5 per cent, to $20.3 million, as bus ad sales slowed.\n\nThe one bright spot came in rentals, where new shops and renewals helped rental operating profit to increase by 30.7 per cent, to $15.4 million.\n\nThe year ahead continues to look bumpy with bus ridership growth expected to moderate to a slower pace.\n\nThe opening of the Downtown Line, however, is expected to boost rail ridership as well as advertising and rental sales. Staff costs and other operating expenses, however, are expected to continue growing.\n\n\"The outlook for bus and rail segments will continue to be challenging,\" SBS stated.\n\nSBS is a 75 per cent-owned subsidiary of listed ComfortDelGro Corp, which also runs taxi services in Singapore.\n\nComfortDelGro will report its full-year results after the close today.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The previous high of US$111 billion was recorded in 2007, before the onset of the global financial crisis, said HFR, a Chicago-based firm that specialises in hedge fund analysis.\n\nTotal assets managed by Asian hedge funds were boosted by investor allocations and performance gains, the report said. In the fourth quarter last year, investors allocated some US$4.2 billion of new capital in Asian hedge funds, the biggest quarterly inflow since the first quarter of 2008 when HFR started collecting data.\n\nHFR president Kenneth Heinz said: \"2013 was an exceptional year for the Asian hedge fund industry, posting strong performance gains across the region as assets surpassed the pre-financial crisis peak, both despite divergent equity market trends across developed and emerging Asia.\n\n\"The Asian hedge fund industry has now emerged as the preferred mechanism for both global and Asian investors to participate in the exciting growth opportunities while mitigating complex risks associated with quantitative easing, currency devaluation or prospective RMB appreciation and structural concerns regarding banking institutions. Despite emerging market-centric currency and equity volatility to begin 2014, investors are likely to increase allocations to Asian hedge funds as these themes evolve in H1 2014.\"\n\nAsian capital inflows were strongest into Japanese-focused hedge funds, reaching US$4.5 billion last year. This was followed by inflows into emerging Asia funds, at US$3 billion. Data showed that two hedge fund strategies were in vogue: the equity hedge and event driven. In Q4, investors allocated US$2.5 billion to Asian equity-hedge funds and US$1.4 billion to Asian event-driven funds. Other funds attracted smaller inflows.\n\nThe equity hedge - or long/short hedge - is the most common hedge strategy. It involves buying stocks which are undervalued and shorting those which are overvalued. This can be executed by pledging long positions in expected gainers as collateral for short positions in stocks which are expected to make losses.\n\nWith an event-driven strategy, hedge funds can invest in distressed companies, such as those going through a bankruptcy. This is done, for instance, by buying senior debt - which is likely to experience the smallest haircut if the situation calls for it. The fund can wait for the company to go through a successful restructuring and sell the bonds for a profit. An event-driven strategy can also be executed through activism, where funds try to get onto corporate boards to steer a company according to their strategic direction.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One minute of dreamtime is the equivalent of 20 minutes in real life. So if you take 20 minutes to eat a steak, you'd take just one minute to dream the act of eating a steak from start to finish. Now, if you're dreaming within a dream, one minute of intra-dreaming supposedly feels like 400 minutes of real life.\n\nStan Lai's magnum opus of a play is called A Dream Within A Dream. And within its 7\u00bd-hour endurance test of a runtime, it criss-crosses continents, eras, characters and realities to tell a story-within-a-story-within-a-story: A doctor's attempts to get close to one of her patients prompts the latter to narrate the story of his life and friendship with another patient, who in turn narrates her own life story as a Shanghainese courtesan.\n\nCondensing 80 years of history into 7\u00bd hours, A Dream has none of the economy, thrilling action and high-tech concepts of Nolan's Inception, which also tells stories within stories. In fact, some reviewers have complained that Lai's story of an architect's romances that is linked to the dramatic upheavals of a courtesan's fortunes is so sprawling, it could have been cut by half without losing its essence.\n\nBut doing so would certainly diminish the languid, meditative quality of the story that elegantly evokes several histories and lifetimes; doing so would also weaken the communal underpinnings of Lai's brand of theatre experience.\n\nFor Lai has always been interested in bringing Chinese theatre back to its communal roots and narrative traditions, before Hollywood and YouTube quickened the pace of stories and replaced lengthy emotional trajectories with visual cues and narrative shorthands.\n\nLai does here what he doesn't do for any of his other plays - place some 240 members of the audience within a \"lotus pond\" arrangement surrounded by a square perimeter of platforms. The action occurs all around and in between the audience, who are seated on swivel chairs to facilitate their 360-degree view.\n\nAs one of the 240, one feels like a fly on the wall witnessing up close the drama of lovers and families unfold.\n\nOne feels not just the interwovenness of the stories, but also the intractable pull of Fate intervening now and again to set the characters on predestined paths.\n\nThough A Dream Like A Dream sags sometimes under the weight of its own slow, patient and old-fashioned form of storytelling, there's still so much to admire in its epic narrative tapestry, technical ambition and logistical daring.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In line with the theme Light+HeART, the artworks were chosen for their use of recycled or biodegradable materials, and carry a message of sustainability. The festival itself is powered by the energy savings from URA's \"Switch Off, Turn Up\" campaign, which encourages companies around the Marina Bay area to switch off unnecessary lights and raise the temperatures of their air-conditioners.\n\nHere are some of this year's highlights:\n\n1.26 Singapore by Janet Echelman (USA), The Float @ Marina Bay\n\nIn 2010, an earthquake in Chile shortened the earth's day by 1.26-microseconds, and that event gave American artist Janet Echelman the title for her colourful tsunami-like sculpture - 1.26.\n\nThe work was inspired by the traditional craft of fish net-weaving and lace-making, where Echelman used these materials to recreate the effects of the earthquake with research from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n1.26 discusses the causes and effects of natural disasters and highlights how various populations are linked by their fight against the results of climate change.\n\nThe Pool by Jen Lewin Studio (USA) Marina Bay waterfront promenade (near The Promontory @ Marina Bay)\n\nThis large interactive artwork by American artist Jen Lewin has absolutely nothing to do with swimming or water. Instead, its name refers to the verb \"pool\" and the idea of things being joined together or combined. Some 100 interactive circular pads are arranged in concentric circles, where each pad reacts to foot pressure, as well as the speed and position that the foot lands on - creating swirls and splashes of colour. The work allows several people to interact with it at any one time as it spans a large open space - a common trait among the artist's works.\n\nCLOUD by Catlind r c Brown & Wayne Garrett (Canada), The Float @ Marina Bay\n\nUp to 7,000 new and re-appropriated light bulbs make up this installation. Passers-by can pull on strings to switch some of them on and off. As the light in different parts of the \"cloud\" flicker, they mimic the look of an actual cloud when lightning flashes in a thunderstorm.\n\nOnly 200 of these bulbs are actually working energy-efficient bulbs that produce the glow, while the rest are recycled incandescent bulbs that are only meant to be an ornamental layer.\n\nArtists Catlind r c Brown & Wayne Garrett combined these traditional lightbulbs with modern energy-efficient ones with the intention of drawing people to interact and work together to turn the entire sculpture off or on.\n\nLight Rain by Troika (UK), The Float @ Marina Bay (under the Seating Gallery)\n\nWhat do you do when you're walking outdoors and it starts to rain? Run, of course. And chances are when you're running in the rain, there isn't much time to notice and appreciate the falling raindrops.\n\nBut with Troika's work titled Light Rain, festival-goers can comfortably watch the hypnotic pitter-patter of rain falling on the ground without getting themselves wet, as light is projected onto the ground forming the rhythmic rippling pattern of water droplets.\n\nThe piece created by artists Sebastien Noel, Eva Rucki, and Conny Freyer aims to explore the simple and often neglected wonders of nature especially in the context of bustling city life.\n\nDigital Wattle by Out of the Dark (New Zealand), Near The Float @ Marina Bay\n\nPerhaps you've heard of the Golden Wattle, which is a tree that produces fluffy yellow flowers and also happens to be the floral emblem of Australia.\n\nThat was what inspired a series of contemporary light installations titled Digital Wattle, a \"tree\" of glowing orbs of light, created by the New Zealand-based company Out of the Dark.\n\nThis artwork explores the co-existence of various individual ethnic groups in a city, where the changing colours of the \"flowers\" represent the mixing of new cultures.\n\ni Light Marina Bay 2014 runs from March 7 to March 30 around the Marina Bay waterfront, from 7.30pm to 11pm daily.

The initial investment will be contributed by both parties in proportion to their respective stakes in the joint venture.\n\n\"It is a new line of business for SIA. We're excited to get into this venture because it adds to our portfolio of companies, and is something that we've been known to do very well in - which is train our pilots,\" Goh Choon Phong, SIA's CEO, said at a media briefing at the Singapore Airshow yesterday.\n\nThe AATC will start out at the existing SIA Training Centre near Changi Airport, and move to Seletar Aerospace Park when a dedicated facility is completed.\n\n\"Eventually, we do expect the business to grow rapidly, and Seletar will be where we will expand further,\" Mr Goh said. Asked when the move would take place, he replied: \"We will have to work on that because . . . we have to go through the regulatory approvals.\"\n\nExpected to be operational before year-end, the AATC will provide training services to airlines in the region, using full-flight simulators for Airbus A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 aircraft types.\n\nIn response to queries on what proportion of AATC's revenue would come from third-party business, Airbus CEO and president Fabrice Br\u00e9gier said it would be premature to answer that. \"Our goal is clearly to attract as many Asian customers as possible . . . so the question for me is not this percentage, but whether in the coming years, we have to invest jointly in more simulators here.\"\n\nThis training centre will be the latest in Airbus's global network of training centres, including those in Beijing, Miami and Toulouse.\n\nSIA's move into this area comes at a time when the industry faces mounting demand for trained pilots. Airbus had previously estimated that from 2013 to 2032, the Asia-Pacific region's carriers will take delivery of 10,940 new passenger and cargo aircraft worth US$1.8 trillion. This would make up 37 per cent of the 29,200 planes forecast to be required globally.\n\nThe deal is not expected to have a material effect on the net tangible assets or earnings per share of the SIA group for its financial year ending March 31, 2014, it said in a statement yesterday.

Another 6.3 million sq ft of offices are in the planning stages.\n\nAt the same time, the Real Estate Board of New York, the trade organisation for the city's commercial landlords, is pushing for a revival of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's aborted attempt to re-zone the office districts surrounding Grand Central Terminal to replace old and obsolete towers.\n\nThe group cited a study by the city's Independent Budget Office issued in September that projected that the city needs about 52 million sq ft of new office space between now and 2040 to accommodate expected job growth and space that could be lost to conversions and demolitions.\n\nIt's an \"open question\" whether there will be enough appetite for new offices to fill that amount of space, Mr Harbert said.\n\nThe trade organisation's president Steven Spinola argues that the 2013 data represent current market realities that could reverse abruptly. The average Manhattan office building is more than 70 years old, according to trade group.\n\nThe tenant mix has shifted more to technology, advertising, media and information firms that tend to take smaller blocks of space. Such \"creative\" companies represented 24 per cent of the leasing market last year, about the same share as financial services, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc.\n\nIn 2005, financials made up 29 per cent of the market, while the creative industry was only 17 per cent. Law firms have fallen to 8 per cent of the market from 11 per cent.\n\nOf the 344 leases last year by financial companies - including banks, hedge funds and private equity firms - only 20 were for more than 50,000 sq ft, according to Cushman.\n\nThe \"vast majority\" of tenants seeking 250,000 sq ft or more - enough to anchor a new skyscraper - have chosen to remain in their existing locations, Isaac Zion, co-chief investment officer for SL Green Realty Corp, said at an investor presentation in December. The trend is likely to continue, he said in a phone interview.\n\n\"When you relocate, you've got to spend all that capital at once,\" said Mr Zion, whose company is Manhattan's biggest owner of office buildings. \"If you stay where you are, you can manage that over a long period of time. You can stage it better to spread out that risk. Once you move, you have to do it at once. Then what if your business changes? What if things evolve?\"\n\nMany companies are opting to stay put because of a shortage of new construction in East Midtown, a \"prime location\" for office tenants, said SL Green chief executive Marc Holliday.\n\nLast month, Zurich- based Credit Suisse said it intends to remain at 11 Madison Avenue, a 1931 tower once used as a setting by Woody Allen for the movie Radio Days, for its US headquarters.\n\nThe second-largest Swiss bank came close to a deal to anchor a skyscraper at Brookfield Office Properties Inc's Manhattan West, according to brokers at Cushman & Wakefield, which represented the developer.\n\nBrookfield is planning four million square feet of new offices at its Manhattan West project, part of an effort to transform the now largely industrial area west of Pennsylvania Station into a commercial district.\n\nThe area also is where Related Cos is building Hudson Yards, a 17.4 million sq ft development built largely over a 26-acre (11-hectare) train yard. About 10 million sq ft will be offices.\n\nCredit Suisse's decision came about four weeks after Citigroup extended its lease for 2.6 million sq ft at SL Green's 388-390 Greenwich St, in Tribeca, last year's biggest New York office lease. The bank is poised to leave its headquarters at 399 Park Ave, according to landlord Boston Properties Inc.\n\nCitigroup, the third-biggest US bank, had weighed anchoring the proposed Two World Trade Center tower in Lower Manhattan, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations who asked not to be named because the process was private.\n\nIt also rejected a move to the Hudson Yards project earlier in its decision-making process.\n\nA Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on its space decisions.\n\nIn December 2012, UBS renewed its lease for about 860,000 sq ft at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, an office tower near Rockefeller Center. Switzerland's largest bank was in negotiations to lease offices at the trade centre site before withdrawing from talks in 2011, say people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nCredit Suisse and Citigroup intend to rework and upgrade their properties.\n\nCredit Suisse plans to move to the less-expensive lower floors of 11 Madison, and spend the next four years renovating those offices, according to a statement to staff by Rob Shafir, the bank's CEO for the Americas. It expects to save close to US$700 million over the life of the lease.\n\nAs a general rule, moving into new space is cheaper in the long run than retrofitting old offices, said Richard Bernstein, a New York-based executive vice- chairman at brokerage Cassidy Turley. New space is more energy-efficient and conducive to open layouts that allow more people to fit into less space, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, many technology companies, such as Google Inc, Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and EBay Inc, have chosen to move their New York operations into vintage buildings in the area roughly between 30th and Canal streets known as Midtown South, rather than to new construction.\n\nMidtown South is \"the centre of New York's technology universe\", Jonathan Mazur, Newmark Grubb's capital markets research director, wrote in a report last week.\n\nWith large financial companies staying out of the market for new towers, at least for now, landlords are going to have to offer \"significant concessions\", said Mr Bernstein of Cassidy Turley.\n\n\"Rents will hold up,\" he said. \"But in order to realise the kind of absorption they need, until we see signs of more growth, I think they're going to have to take that kind of strategy.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The hotel, now called the Palladium, is owned by mall developer Phoenix Mills and both the company and Shangri-La declined to comment on why the partnership ended.\n\nSix years ago, a night at a luxury hotel in the Delhi region cost on average 10,429 rupees - about US$259 at the time and on par with several five-star hotels in Singapore. Occupancy rates were an enviable 74 per cent, according to hospitality consultants HVS, as business travellers flocked to India, an economy that was then growing at nearly 10 per cent.\n\nSince then, economic growth has halved, reducing the flow of corporate guests who make up about 70 per cent of the business for five-star hotels in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nAverage room rates in the capital region have also almost halved to around 6,850 rupees (US$110), while occupancy rates were 55 per cent, according to HVS. The declining economy, and revenues, have sparked a blame-game between owners and operators, prompting the \"reflagging\" of several properties.\n\nOperators say the owners are demanding unrealistic returns after over-leveraging themselves, while owners say operators over-promised on performance.\n\n\"The relationship is breaking because somebody made a promise and the reality is far from the promise - both due to economic reasons and sometimes due to performance lapses,\" said Ashish Jakhanwala, chief executive of Samhi, an Indian firm that owns hotels.\n\nGlobal players with long-term ambitions are encouraged by the prospects for India's hospitality sector, where revenues are expected to more than double to US$36 billion by 2018 from US$17 billion in 2008, according to research firm Technopak Advisors.\n\nStarwood is emerging as one of the more aggressive players in India. About 86 per cent of the company's pipeline of new rooms is outside the United States, mostly in Asia Pacific.\n\nIndia is currently Starwood's fourth-largest market by hotel numbers and by the end of next year, it will move up to third place, overtaking Canada. By building its brand domestically, Starwood also hopes to court the loyalty of Indians travelling abroad.\n\nOther operators are also expanding.\n\nHilton, controlled by private equity giant Blackstone Group, exited a handful of properties in India last year while opening three new hotels. This month, it also announced plans to open its first Conrad hotel next year.\n\nRival Hyatt, which runs 17 hotels in India and has 40 under development, is in advanced talks to manage a 228-room Delhi property that until the end of 2013 was a Hilton, according to sources.\n\nLondon-based InterContinental, which runs 18 hotels in India and aims to have 57 over the next four to five years, is also seeking to take over two hotels that were run by Hilton in New Delhi. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

This was largely due to lower outlays for government emoluments.\n\nPrivate investment continued to blaze away, registering growth of 16.5 per cent, up from 15.2 per cent in the previous quarter, thanks largely to Prime Minister Najib Razak's Economic Transformation Programme which sets great store on capital-intensive infrastructure works.\n\nPublic investment shrank 2.1 per cent against a smaller contraction in Q3, reflecting lower spending by public enterprises and the smaller development budget for the year.\n\nOn the supply side, all sectors, except for commodities, grew strongly. Commodities declined owing to the lower production of oil, palm oil and rubber.\n\nWhat will concern the government is the headline inflation figure. The central bank said inflation during the last quarter jumped to 3 per cent from 2.2 per cent on the back of rises in fuel and sugar prices.\n\nThe trade surplus widened to RM27.4 billion (S$10.4 billion) in Q4. The good news is that the current account surplus on the country's balance of payments in 2013 was a comfortable RM37 billion, though that is considerably lower than the RM50 billion registered for 2012.\n\nMore disquieting was the fact that net outflows accelerated in Q4 to RM9.7 billion from RM1.5 billion in the previous quarter. The outflows could accelerate considerably this year as the US Federal Reserve's tapering effort quickens.\n\nThe central bank's international reserves stood at a comfortable US$133.1 billion at the end of January.\n\n\"While domestic demand is expected to moderate following the ongoing fiscal consolidation, the external sector is expected to benefit from the improving global conditions,\" noted Bank Negara. \"The growth momentum is therefore expected to remain on a steady trajectory.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net profit fell 60 per cent, from US$85.7 million to US$34.5 million. Excluding exceptional items - which include provision for the restructuring of European operations and fair-value adjustments of derivatives - net profit for the nine-month period was US$34.7 million, compared with US$81.9 million a year ago.

Net asset value as at end-December was 73.85 US cents, compared with 72.43 US cents at the end of March.\n\nGiven lower royalty income from Terumo, overall weak market conditions in the short run and lower average selling prices in various markets, the company expects sales growth for the fiscal year ending March 2014 to be weak.\n\nThe company expects revenue to be comparable with FY2013.\n\n\"Looking ahead, in our core DES franchise, we anticipate key regions such as EMEA and APAC to continue to lead growth.

Piraeus, Greece-based Navios paid US$130 million for about 40 per cent of the loans and guaranteed to operate five tankers and five container ships for at least six years, Nordbank said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe remaining US$170 million is converted into a participating loan for 10 years, in the course of which Nordbank will receive 80 per cent of the returns generated by the ships, excluding operating and capital costs, according to the statement.\n\nGermany's top shipping lenders face rising credit default risks this year as bad debt from clients struggling to emerge from the industry's crisis mounts, Moody's Investors Service said in December.\n\nNordbank confirmed recent comments by chief executive officer Constantin von Oesterreich that the lender expects \"a clear triple-digit-million-euro loss after tax\" for 2013, as already indicated on April 11 of last year.\n\nContributing to the 2013 loss, the bank set aside 127 million euros in provisions after it discovered last year that traders executed questionable dividend arbitrage, or dividend stripping, with a \"handful of foreign brokers\", chief financial officer Stefan Ermisch said in December. The trades generated tax credits on capital gains for deals that the state-owned bank didn't pay tax on in the first place, he said.\n\nTo cover potential losses at Nordbank, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein raised a guarantee to 10 billion euros from seven billion euros, which was approved by the European Union on a preliminary basis.\n\nThis year, the bank expects to post \"a significant profit before and after tax\" on lower risk provisions. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Excluding the revaluation and exceptional gains, attributable net profit was up 67 per cent at $119 million.\n\nThe strong pre-tax profit growth was driven by FCL's development property division, where pre-tax profit more than doubled to $131 million, led by the group's Australian development projects. Development property pre-tax profit accounted for 74 per cent of group pre-tax profit.\n\nAustralia was the key driver for the quarter, with the completion of One Central Park and Park Lane Block 5A in Sydney.\n\nIn China, some 750 units (Suzhou Baitang project and Gemdale Mega City) were sold in Q1. In Singapore, development revenue slipped 18 per cent year on year, as most of FCL's inventory had already been sold. As at the end of Q1, total unbooked pre-sales stood at a robust $3 billion.\n\nInvestment properties pre-tax profit increased 37 per cent to $20 million on the back of improved office and industrial property rental rates and occupancy. Hospitality pre-tax profit grew 23 per cent to $16 million, thanks to higher occupancy at Fraser Suites Queens Gate and Fraser Suites Perth.\n\n\"The group achieved robust growth in 1Q FY13/14, with solid performance across property and geographical segments,\" said Lim Ee Seng, group CEO of FCL.\n\nHe said Australia was the key growth driver this quarter and the supply-demand dynamics in the market continue to validate the group's decision to focus on Australia as one of its main markets.\n\nMr Lim said the group will focus on selectively acquiring sites to replenish its landbank while continuing to deliver its pipeline in the core markets of Singapore, Australia and China.\n\n\"FCL will also seek opportunities to unlock value in our portfolio via asset enhancement or repositioning efforts, as well as possible injection of stabilised assets into our Reits.\"\n\nTotal assets increased to $11.5 billion as at end-December from $10.4 billion as at end-September. With investment properties valued at $4.08 billion and properties held for sale of $4.58 billion, this should place the property group in the league of Singapore's big-cap properties developers, said CIMB Securities. The group holds a land bank of about 12.8 million square feet from its core markets of Singapore, Australia and China.\n\nCIMB expects FCL's Australian sales to remain a key earnings driver in Q2 and Q3.\n\n\"Including the potential sale of Changi City Point and One@Changi, we believe that FCL could recycle assets of around $1 billion in 2014. This would fund potential new acquisitions and/or initiatives to revitalise its commercial property portfolio,\" it said.\n\nCIMB has an \"Add\" rating on the stock with a price target of $2.06 per share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The average daily rate (ADR) was $193.7, or 8.9 per cent, below forecast. This resulted in the average revenue per available room (RevPAR) to fall short of the forecast by 7.4 per cent, at $166.6.\n\nExcluding RHS, average occupancy was 85.4 per cent, ADR was $193 while RevPAR was $164.8.\n\nOn the serviced residences end, average occupancy was 89.5 per cent, 0.5 of a percentage point lower than the Q4 forecast. However, the ADR for the quarter picked up to $252.8, 1.8 per cent above forecast. As a result, revenue per available serviced residence unit was $226.3, or 1.3 per cent higher than the forecast.\n\nFor the quarter, gross revenue was $33.6 million and net property income was $30.5 million, short of the forecast by 3 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe rental revenue from the excluded commercial premises in the hotels and serviced residences was $5.5 million, or 8.2 per cent above the forecast.\n\nFor the full year ended December, DPS was 5.64 cents (3.1 per cent below forecast of 5.82 cents) while income available for distribution was $94.6 million, or 3.1 per cent below the forecast of $97.7 million. The full year's DPS translates into an annualised yield of 6.7 per cent based on the closing price of 84 cents on Dec 31.\n\nFollowing the revaluation of Far East H-Trust's investment properties on Dec 31, the portfolio of eight hotels and four serviced residences has been valued at about $2.47 billion. As at end December, Far East H-Trust's total asset value stood at $2.53 billion and the net asset value per stapled security was 98.32 cents.\n\nThe Far East H-Trust counter ended trading unchanged at 79.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is expected to begin sales next week at a 30-year leasehold strata factory project, The Index in Tuas South Avenue 3.\n\nThe average price of the factory units is expected to be around $330-350 per square foot (psf), slightly below the $360 psf average the group achieved for its nearby project, The Westcom in Tuas South Avenue 6. So far, it has sold about 92 per cent of the 144 warehouse and factory units in The Westcom, which is coming up on a site with 41 years left on its original 60-year lease term. Far East bought the site in 1995.\n\nAs for The Index, the property giant is offering 98 strata factories as well as a staff canteen for sale. There will be three unit types, according to size - Type A (32,754 sq ft to 33,615 sq ft), Type B (10,613-14,574 sq ft) and Type C (2,195-8,697 sq ft).\n\nThe Index is likely to attract owner-occupiers such as those in marine engineering or the recycling business in addition to property investors, say market watchers.\n\nFar East is developing The Index on a 426,019 sq ft site zoned for Business 2 use which it clinched at a JTC tender last year. Its unit, Grow-Tech Properties, paid nearly $66.78 million or $112 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr).\n\n\"The industrial property market in Tuas is hotter than on the rest of the island right now,\" observes Knight Frank executive director (industrial) Lim Kien Kim. He attributes demand to the growing business community in the location as well as hype about the future port in the area.\n\nFar East Organization, though no newbie to the industrial property sector, seems to be increasingly turning its attention to this segment.\n\nNext quarter, it is planning to launch two industrial projects along Gambas Crescent in the Woodlands/Sembawang area on three 30-year leasehold land parcels it clinched at Urban Redevelopment Authority tenders last year.\n\nFor each of these two projects, it will be developing terrace units, with ramp-up and flatted factories on top.\n\nOne project will be on Parcel 1, for which Grow-Tech paid $137.90 psf ppr at a tender last October. For the other project, the group will be combining Parcels 2 and 3 - for which it paid $127.19 psf ppr in the October tender and $102.20 psf ppr in a December tender, respectively.\n\nIn the past three years (2011-2013) the group has sold 363 strata industrial units totalling nearly 1.2 million sq ft for $431.5 million. These units are in Westlink One and Two, Tradelink Place and The Westcom, which are all in Tuas, and Enterprise One and Eunos Technolink, both in Kaki Bukit.\n\nAs part of its investment property portfolio held for rental income, Far East has nearly two million sq ft lettable industrial space. This comprises 238 units in nine projects, including 51 Tuas View Link, Richfield Industrial Centre, 36 Kaki Bukit Place, Eunos Techpark 2 and Warehouses@TPC (Tuas Parcel C).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Etihad CEO James Hogan said his company was undertaking final due diligence.\n\n\"We should be able to say something (about this) in about 10 days,\" Mr Hogan told BT.\n\nIndeed, if it does buy a reported 40 per cent stake in Alitalia for some 300 million euros (about S$515 million), Etihad would tie up a deal which has eluded numerous other big players, including its own European strategic partner Air France-KLM.\n\nAnd in doing so, it would be firmly digging its heels into Europe's fourth largest air travel market.\n\nThe 10-year-old Abu Dhabi-based carrier, which has a fleet of some 90 planes and another 120 planes on order, has made a string of equity purchases in airlines in Europe, Asia and the Pacific in recent years in its bid to boost growth and market access.\n\nIt now owns 29 per cent of airberlin, 40 per cent of Air Seychelles, almost 20 per cent of Virgin Australia, 3 per cent of Aer Lingus, and more recently bought 49 per cent of Air Serbia, 24 per cent into India's Jet Airways and is buying 33 per cent of Switzerland-based Darwin Airline. In all, it has 47 codeshare partnerships around the globe.\n\nBut it has no plans to join an airline alliance.\n\nMr Hogan said strategic partnerships through equity stakes enabled Etihad to side-step bilateral constraints, and gain penetration into new markets and domestic destinations in those markets.\n\nOf course, it will also help feed traffic to and through its Abu Dhabi hub.\n\n\"Some 20 per cent of our revenue now comes from these tie-ups, and we will announce our third consecutive year of profit next week,\" he said. \"With some 350 destinations on offer, we are now the world's sixth largest airline group.\"\n\nMore deals could follow, he hinted: \"We will purchase (stakes) where it makes sense.\"\n\nOperational rationalisation and cost management are often the first steps after the deal. In some cases, as in Air Seychelles and Air Serbia, it takes on management contracts. \"Air Seychelles was losing US$25 million, but we managed to turn it around to a profit of US$1 million in 2012. Air Serbia now enjoys strong traffic and a modern fleet.\"\n\nSavvy cost management enabled Etihad to recoup its US$105 million investment in airberlin within six months. Mr Hogan also sounded excited with the recent purchase of a 24 per cent in India's Jet Airways. \"Jet gives us access to a huge market where there are now 40 million people who travel internationally, and connections into 26 Indian cities. And there is huge traffic between South Asia and the Gulf.\"\n\nLooking at Australia, where Etihad's co-investors in Virgin Australia are Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines, Mr Hogan ventured: \"If we have all CEOs involved, Virgin Australia will have one of the strongest boards of any airline.\"\n\nEtihad's investments are funded with internal cash flows, bank borrowings and export credit. Mr Hogan said that Etihad has tapped US$5 billion from debt markets in the last five years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This means a hike of 1.75 percentage points (half of the 3.5 percentage-point difference). At yesterday's press conference, however, Mr Heng said the increase could be 1-2 percentage points.\n\nYesterday, the labour movement also called on the government to update the long-term targeted CPF rates to ensure that these will build up enough funds for workers' medical and retirement needs.\n\nMr Heng noted that the long- term rates for the various age bands were last set in 2003 - and many of these have already been exceeded today.\n\nIn reviewing the long-term rates, NTUC said the government could also move the contributions by employers and employees \"progressively towards parity within each age band\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The outlay, in any case, would also reflect the shift in Singapore's future social spending as the senior segment of the population grows. As for the pioneers, the healthcare hongbao will certainly help ease worries for many about looming medical bills in their twilight years, and spell savings that can cover other expenses.\n\nBut even the well-off among them should not be \"means-tested\" out of the perks; this special package is not meant as a social handout but a big gesture of appreciation to all seniors. The well-to- do could instead be encouraged to pay it forward by contributing to charity or society in other ways.\n\nThe other bit of good news for \"no-longer-young\" Singaporeans comes in the call by the labour movement to raise the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rate for those in the 50-55 age group, bringing it in line with the level for younger workers (even if not in one go).\n\nSingapore has gone out of its way in recent years to urge employers to keep (or \"rehire\") older staff, wielding both carrot and stick. But the reality is, it's still an ageist work culture in many sectors here, where the rank and file in the 50s and older are typically seen as \"over the hill\", or deemed to have lost their energy and verve.\n\nIn that light, and against the trend of CPF cuts for older workers, the prospect of a CPF hike for the 50-55 group is certainly quite welcome. If anything, a longer life expectancy calls for bigger retirement savings, not smaller.\n\nEmployers, of course, are less than enthusiastic about the prospect of higher costs, and have urged caution at any rate restoration. In fact, they have had notice. CPF rates for older workers - slashed during the 2003 recession - were partially restored, to current levels, in 2012, with the government promising then that the rate for the 50-55 age group (now 32.5 per cent) will eventually go up to the mainstream 36 per cent level. While business costs are a valid concern, there is no reason why those in their 50s - who would typically have at least another decade of productive years left - should have lower CPF contributions.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A transport management partnership with VietJet Air was also announced.\n\nIn Asia, the company has focused on the Philippines and China, with more than a third of its 26,000 employees based there. The group is trebling its workshop and warehouse capacity in Shenzhen to 25,000 square metres and expects the facility to be ready in April this year.\n\nLufthansa Technik operates a 200 sq m logistics facility in Singapore, and is looking to double that area to be faster and closer to its customers.\n\n\"Singapore is still an important hub for us in managing our customers in the region as a logistics hub, and this is what we are going to expand,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Hungate said the country is poised to serve emerging-market consumption, which leads to growth in pharmaceutical transhipment and exports.\n\nAirfreight volumes have been flat, but the handling of pharmaceutical cargo \"is one area in which customers are willing to pay for the exacting standards they need to deliver the product\", he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Safe Cycling Day, which has traditionally been held on one Saturday every year, will be extended to the last Sunday of every month through a social media drive.\n\nThe distribution of 2,000 popular cycling jerseys will continue on the first Safe Cycling Day of 2014 on Saturday, Feb 15, with an appeal to donate and support National Safe Cycling initiatives organised by the Singapore Road Safety Council.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The Western world is struggling now five years with a job market recovery,\" he said.\n\n\"It's in our view that some of it is not just cyclical but structural - there's a change in the nature of work itself. And if that theory is right, then this issue of income inequality and the haves and have-nots is actually going to get exacerbated over coming periods of time.\"\n\nSince 2012, DBS has provided over $1.8 million in grants to 56 social enterprises across the region. Of this, more than $550,000 has been given to eight social enterprises in Singapore including Adrenalin, A-changin, Bizlink and Billion Bricks.\n\nDBS also remains the only bank to offer virtually free banking services to social enterprises in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan.\n\nThe DBS Foundation is chaired by Euleen Goh, DBS Group Holdings board member. Ms Goh is also non-executive chairman of the Singapore International Foundation.\n\nSaid Ms Goh: \"In this era of 'New Capitalism', we must deliver value to all our stakeholders. This means doing what's right by our customers, employees and the community as well as our shareholders. With a sense of shared purpose and meaning, not only will our people be more engaged, as an organisation, we can also make a greater impact in the communities we operate in.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Home prices rose for the first time since 2010 in the third quarter, official statistics showed.\n\n\"There is still a mismatch between asking prices and selling prices, for which there is no official data in Spain,\" said Fernando Encinar, Idealista's co-founder.\n\nA pickup in foreign investment in Spanish real estate and a recovering economy are prompting sellers to refrain from lowering prices as they hold out for better offers. Home sales fell 16 per cent in November from a year earlier and dropped 4.1 per cent on a monthly basis, according to data released by the National Statistics Institute on Jan 14.\n\nThat's hindering a housing market correction, according to Jose Garcia Montalvo, professor of economics at the University of Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.\n\nSome of the largest Spanish real estate deals have been done by New York-based Blackstone Group, which in July agreed to purchase 18 apartment blocks from the city of Madrid for 125.5 million euros (S$217 million). Goldman Sachs Group, based in New York, and Azora Capital in August agreed to pay about 20 per cent above the asking price for 32 social housing developments sold by the capital's regional government.\n\n\"The investment we have seen from foreign funds in the past six months has made sellers - who up until now were desperate to sell and were lowering prices - too optimistic about the recovery of the housing market,\" Mr Montalvo said. \"Sellers are delaying sales and not dropping asking prices because they expect the market is going to recover.\"\n\nHome prices are falling more slowly than they should be and this is delaying a recovery, Mr Montalvo said.\n\nInvestors spent 4.93 billion euros on property assets in Spain last year, more than double the 2.32 billion euros invested in 2012, as the economy came out of its second recession since 2008. The government forecasts that economic growth next year will be strong enough to create jobs, even as the International Monetary Fund predicts the unemployment rate won't fall below 25 per cent until 2018.\n\nHome prices rose 0.7 per cent in the third quarter from the previous three months, the first increase since 2010, the National Statistics Institute said in December. Studies by the IESE Business School and property website Fotocasa showed that prices for existing homes rose 0.7 per cent in July from June and 0.2 per cent in January from December.\n\nThe data could give a \"false sense\" that prices, which have fallen more than 45 per cent since their 2007 peak, have hit bottom, Mr Encinar said.\n\nOffers in the Spanish city of Lleida had the steepest discounts at an average of 33 per cent. The smallest bid shortfalls were in Cuenca at 17.6 per cent, according to the Idealista study, the first such report by the property website.\n\n\"Home prices haven't bottomed out yet and I don't know when they will,\" Juan Fernandez Aceytuno, head of Sociedad de Tasacion, Spain's home appraisal organisation, said on Jan 14. \"Nobody knows how many homes are up for sale in Spain or where they are situated.\"\n\nMr Aceytuno estimates prices will fall a further 5 per cent or 6 per cent in the first half as high unemployment and a drought in mortgage financing prevent Spaniards from buying homes.\n\nSpain's jobless rate was at 26.03 per cent in the three months through December, up from 25.98 per cent in the previous quarter, the National Statistics Institute said on Jan 23.\n\nFewer than 13,900 mortgages were granted in November, compared with about 129,000 at the September 2005 peak, according to INE data. Prices have fallen by an average of 45.6 per cent since their high point in 2007, according to Sociedad de Tasacion. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Sommad Pholsena, Asean Transport Ministers chairman, said: \"Apart from allowing both sides to better capitalise on the opportunities in and the capabilities of each other, a bloc-to-bloc agreement would also facilitate further intra-Asean integration by allowing Asean to learn from the EU's experience in developing a single aviation market.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If the US economy performs better than expected, as many analysts have been saying, pressures will build for the Fed to raise rates soon to prevent the economy from overheating. The current forecast is for the first rate rise to hit at the end of next year.\n\nBut an emerging market scare in January, along with some profit taking in developed market stocks, has caused money to flow back into bonds, lowering yields. US 10-year Treasury yields were trading at 2.67 per cent earlier in the week, compared with 2.86 per cent a month earlier.\n\nOn the surface, the new retail bond appears to be fairly priced. A CapitaMalls Asia step-up 3.8 per cent bond due 2022 is trading at a slight premium to par. Arguably, CMT, a Reit with stable revenue-generating properties, is less risky than its sister company, a developer - and hence its yield should be lower than 3.8 per cent.\n\nAnd 3.08 per cent a year is not too bad for savers if the interest rate environment remains low. Those who signed up for similar structured depo-sit products with banks recently might be kicking themselves. Last November, a Maybank five-year structured deposit product offered 1.88 per cent a year - a full 120 basis points below what CMT is offering.\n\nWith a portfolio of 16 shopping malls that has a committed occupancy of 98.5 per cent at end-2013, and given CMT's track record of managing malls as well as Singaporeans' propensity to shop, there is very little risk of default. Moreover, CMT is rated \"A\" by Moody's. This also puts it in an investment grade category where the likelihood of default is quite low.\n\nBut an eventual rate rise in the medium term back to the Fed's longer-run rate of 4 per cent will make CMT's 3.08 per cent bond unattractive. (The \"8\" is a distraction, think about it as a 3 per cent bond.)\n\nA corporate bond similar to CMT's offering should be priced at least a couple of percentage points above the Federal Funds Rate - the overnight lending rate at which the Fed decides to lend to financial institutions. Currently, A-rated bonds offered by companies with similar credit profiles as CMT are trading at 2.07 per cent for five-year bonds and 3.67 per cent for 10-year bonds - priced more than 1.5 and three percentage points respectively above the Fed funds rate, currently near zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed has projected interest rates to rise to 0.75 per cent by the end of next year, about 1.75 per cent by end-2016, and 4 per cent in the longer term. This means that using a conservative two percentage point premium for CMT's bond, the yield on a fresh seven-year A-rated corporate bond might rise above 3 per cent as early as 2016, when there are five years left before CMT's bond period is up. Those who lock up too much money in the CMT bond will miss out on a lot of potential yield.\n\nInstead of being satisfied with 3 per cent on the CMT bond, investors with a slightly greater risk appetite should put their money with CMT itself. The company is paying 10.27 cents per share for 2013, representing a dividend yield of 5.6 per cent based on Tuesday's closing price of $1.825.\n\nAll said, CMT is getting a good deal. It just needs to pay 3 per cent on its bonds, but it generates a better return on its assets. Its latest 2013 net property income yield is already more than 5 per cent.\n\nBlue chip stocks, too, offer around 3 to 4 per cent of yield right now, with the prospect of capital appreciation that bondholders do not have. A recent correction has made them more attractive.\n\nOf course, the offering is a good deal if the current low interest rate environment persists for the next seven years, because of another recession or crisis in the near term. The CMT bond roughly prices in a 0.25 percentage point increase in interest rates every year for the next seven years.\n\nThe offering looks like a good deal only for savers who want to minimise the risk to their nest eggs, and who reckon that another global economic or financial crisis is on the cards. Locking in a 3 per cent yield for seven years makes sense.\n\nPortfolios can be hedged with safe bonds that will be held to maturity. But in an environment of recovering global growth, those with a greater risk appetite will have more attractive options.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is understood that the EU ban will not cover existing CoCs.\n\nAn officer with a valid endorsement of recognition issued one day before the expected ban can continue working on an EU vessel for the next five years - depending on the validity of the original CoC.\n\nThe international shipmanagement association, InterManager, recently issued an advisory to its members suggesting that \"to mitigate the immediate impact of any possible ban that may be promulgated by the EU, InterManager is calling on all ship managers to ensure their Filipino officers have extended the validity of their Certificate of Competency prior to any ban coming into force.\"\n\nInterManager noted that by extending the validity of their CoCs, Filipino officers will be able to gain a maximum five-year period of grace. Hopefully, the Philippines will be able to resolve the deficiencies in its training and certification system within the five-year period. The association used the example of Georgia which was subject to a similar ban but was able to restore the integrity of its certificates within two years.\n\nInterManager is also advising owners and managers to hold discussions with various Port State Controls to extend this five-year window to Filipino officers serving on non-EU flagged vessels which may call on EU ports.\n\nInterManager also noted that industry discussions are underway with a number of countries, such as the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium, to allow their recognised schools to assess Filipino cadets for their CoCs, thus allowing these cadets to qualify to work on EU-flagged ships.\n\nThe German Shipowners Association (VDR) has issued a similar call to its members. \"We strongly recommend the immediate renewal of existing CoCs of Philippine officers that you would still like to employ on your vessels. Additionally there should be an application for recognition of a European flag state, which will initially be valid for five years.\"\n\nThe immediate effect of the audit failure would be the \"de-recognition\" by EU member states of the STCW certificates issued by the Philippine government to its seafarers. Contrary to earlier reports, the ban will only cover officers. Ratings and hotel personnel on EU-flagged cargo and cruise vessels will not be affected. Estimates place the number of Filipino officers aboard EU-registered vessels at between 2,000 and 3,000.\n\nWhile the numbers are small, there is a danger that an EU ban could spread to other flag registries. This would not only result in large-scale unemployment of Filipino seafarers but could lead to a worldwide manpower crisis as a quarter of crews manning international vessels are Filipinos.\n\nWhile the reports are yet to be confirmed, international shipowners are preparing for a worst-case scenario. Intermanager president Gerardo Borromeo said: \"The message we are giving out as responsible ship managers is that our primary duty is to ensure that ships continue to sail safely and efficiently, which means we will put the right people onboard these ships and, in the case of Filipinos, we will work with the right crewing institutions and entities to ensure these officers are properly trained and certificated.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley are managing the offering, according to a regulatory filing on Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. La Quinta didn't specify the number of shares being sold or a price range.\n\nBlackstone has taken hotel companies Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Extended Stay America Inc public, both of which have increased since their debuts late last year. La Quinta, based in Irving, Texas, said in December that it had filed a prospectus confidentially under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.\n\nBlackstone acquired La Quinta in January 2006 for about US$3 billion, according to company statements. The New York-based private-equity firm explored a sale of the company before opting instead for an IPO, people with knowledge of the matter said in November. La Quinta operates and franchises more than 800 hotels in the US, Canada and Mexico, according to its website. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt, according to the prospectus.\n\nHilton, the world's biggest hotel operator, has climbed 7.1 per cent since its Dec 11 debut, while Extended Stay, a mid-priced lodging chain, has surged 28 per cent from its IPO on Nov 12.\n\nLa Quinta, which posted revenue of US$818 million in 2012, is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 2010 and 2011, according to Monday's filing, and may be required to pay additional taxes for those years. The IRS gave notice of a proposed adjustment of US$158 million as of Jan 9, the filing shows.\n\nThe IRS has said the rents charged to units for hotel leases exceeded arm's-length rates, according to the filing. La Quinta said the rent payable under such lease is based on a study prepared by an expert firm, and that all such rent has been on an arm's- length basis. The company said it expects its tax returns under audit to be sustained upon examination.\n\nAs of Sept 30, La Quinta hadn't established any reserves related to the proposed adjustment \"or any other issues reflected on the returns under examination\", according to the filing. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

But first looks can be deceiving - this plane can be fitted with torpedoes, depth charges and anti-ship missiles. Inside are packed some of the world's most advanced avionics, radars and sensors, making it the only long- range marine patrol aircraft that can hunt and destroy submarines.\n\n\"When you want the best long-range anti-submarine warfare aircraft in that class, we have the product that's most developed,\" said Chris Raymond, an executive vice-president in Boeing's defence, space and security division.\n\nDefence analysts say maritime surveillance is the most pressing security need in East and South- east Asia, made up of predominantly littoral states. Rival maritime claims that have pitted China, which has one of the world's fastest-growing militaries, against Japan and other Asian nations have made the South and East China Seas dangerous flashpoints.\n\nPiracy and smuggling are also rife in the region. And natural disasters strike with depressing regularity, leading to a need for search and rescue aircraft.\n\nBut at about US$175 million apiece, the Poseidon is too expensive an option for most nations. Besides the US, India has bought eight P-8 variants and is in talks on exercising options for four more.\n\nSweden's Saab offers an option lower down the price scale. It is displaying its Saab 340 marine surveillance aircraft at the Airshow which sells for about US$20 million apiece.\n\n\"Many countries want a variety of capabilities for their maritime patrol aircraft, including the ability to search for submarines,\" said Richard Hjelmberg, Saab's chief salesman for maritime surveillance aircraft. \"But not all of them have the budget for that. And when we talk to them, we ask if they really need all of that capability, which comes at a high price. What we find is that they are happy with an aircraft that can provide comprehensive maritime surveillance and allows them to monitor their coast, and we offer that solution.\"\n\nPotential customers could include Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

It is expected to be ready in early 2016.\n\nA further 800 hectares is also available on the island for future expansion if needed, said Eugene Park, CEO of Gallant Venture.\n\nThe first phase of the airport includes a dedicated passenger terminal to allow hub operations for Garuda and its partners. The airport, which is under construction, will have a three- kilometre runway that can accommodate wide-body aircraft.\n\nIt will be a 20-minute drive from Bintan Resorts, which is owned by Gallant Venture, and will be linked to Singapore and Batam by ferry.\n\nThe Singapore company will also set up a joint venture company with Garuda Maintenance Facilities AeroAsia to operate a three-hangar MRO facility on 177 hectares of the aviation park.\n\nGround breaking for the MRO facility is expected in the second quarter of 2014, and the outfit will be bigger than the facilities at Soekarno-Hatta Airport in Jakarta, the company said.\n\nThe Bintan Aerospace Industry Park is a free trade zone and a special economic zone, beneficial for the commercial operations of the aircraft industry in that area.\n\nMr Park said: \"We are confident that Bintan Airport, as the first private international airport in Indonesia, will be a facility we can all be proud of and, of course, a facility we can make profit from.\"\n\nGallant's Bintan Resorts has 1,400 rooms.

It already has a final assembly line for the Airbus A320 in Tianjin, China, as well as an engineering centre in Bangalore.\n\nThis week, it signed an MOU with Singapore's A*Star to collaborate on aviation research, and also announced that it would set up a financial hub here to support its financing activities in Singapore and South-east Asia.\n\nThe region accounts for over a third of its order backlog of some 5,500 planes - making Asia a bigger customer than other markets such as Europe and America - and contributes some 18.3 billion euros (S$31.7 billion) in revenue terms.\n\nAnd, while there has been plenty of talk that Asia may not be able to digest the tremendous number of planes that ever-expanding carriers have on order, Mr Enders remains bullish.\n\n\"Time and again, we've been surprised by the growth. We've had to revise our predictions,\" said the German-born Mr Enders. \"This is one of the fastest growing aviation markets and this is already the most important market for us in the world.\"\n\nAirbus has forecast that the Asia-Pacific will require nearly 11,000 new planes over the next two decades.\n\nHe added: \"Even if some of the carriers who have ordered aircraft are not around when they're supposed to take their aircraft . . . there's so much growth in this region, they can easily be absorbed.\"\n\nFormerly EADS, the group recently rebranded itself the Airbus Group, leveraging on its planemaker arm, which manufactures aircraft such as the double-decker Airbus A380 and the wide-body A350, due to enter into service in 4Q14.\n\nCommercial aircraft is the main growth-driver for the group, making up about two-thirds of its business. Its defence and space unit - which is undergoing restructuring and is slated to shed over 5,000 jobs over three years - in particularly will need to look eastwards as European governments curtail military budgets.\n\nBut Mr Enders stressed the group hasn't thrown in the towel where its defence and space business is concerned. Instead, the restructuring is aimed at making it more competitive, better positioned to grow overseas and more profitable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He added: \"If I am guilty, I feel very proud to be guilty of such things.\"\n\nThe canal authority and the GUPC consortium have locked horns since December over the overruns on widening the canal to accommodate massive cargo ships in the waterway, which handles 5 per cent of global seaborne trade.\n\nGUPC claims unforeseen geological difficulties have forced them to spend much more on cement than expected. They say that they based their estimates on data provided by the Canal Authority that was incorrect.\n\nThe canal expansion is one of the world's most ambitious civil engineering projects and was due to be completed next year - but the builders have said completion may now be delayed up to five years.\n\nThe original canal, built by the US mostly with workers brought in from the Caribbean, was completed in 1914. The canal generates US$960 million a year for Panama, nearly 10 per cent of the country's total annual income.\n\nMeanwhile, delays to the expansion of the Panama Canal may extend a surge in rates for vessels hauling liquefied petroleum gas to Asia from the US, a shipping company and industry analysts said.\n\n\"We have been basing our plans on using Panama, so if there are delays then that's going to tighten the supply of ships,\" Christian Andersen, president of Avance Gas Holding said recently. The company is the fifth largest vessel owner specialising in LPG, according to data from Clarkson plc, the world's biggest shipbroker.\n\nThe proposed enlarged waterway will curb demand for LPG carriers to transport the fuel because the link shaves about 27,000 kilometres off round-voyages between Tokyo and Houston, requiring fewer tankers for the same amount of cargo. The US, which is producing the most crude in 25 years, is accelerating shipments of LPGs including propane and butane because they are byproducts from extracting crude and gas.\n\nDemand for the largest ships hauling LPG, used for cooking and heating, is surging as the US boosts exports. The country has among the world's cheapest supplies of the fuel, which is also a feedstock for the petrochemicals industry.\n\nThe widening of the Panama Canal will reduce the number of ships required to haul one million tonnes a year of LPG to Asia from Houston to four vessels from six, according to Mr Andersen. The delayed start will prolong a rally in freight costs.\n\n\"As long as the Panama Canal remains unfit for taking VLGCs, that's going to have a positive impact on the freight market,\" Erik Nikolai Stavseth, a shipping analyst at Arctic Securities, said last Thursday. \"Assuming exports continue as normal, volumes will continue to be shipped.\"\n\nRates for VLGCs, the industry's biggest ships, will rise to US$45,000 a day in 2015 from US$30,400 in 2012 and then drop to US$37,500 after the completion of the Panama Canal expansion cuts voyage durations, Arctic estimates show.\n\nAvance Gas has six VLGCs on the water and another eight under order. The total fleet of such vessels is about 160 vessels.\n\n\"The volumes will continue to move, it's just that they will move longer-haul, rather than through Panama,\" said Nicola Williams, an analyst at Clarkson. \"We see a continuation of longer-haul movements for a longer time than we'd originally anticipated.\" - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

In Malaysia, the Group operates one flagship Challenger megastore and two Challenger superstores.\n\nLoo Leong Thye, Challenger's CEO, said: \"We think 2014 will continue to be challenging for us. However, we will continue to expand our retail space in Singapore and Malaysia so as to serve and reach out to a wider customer base.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The resulting organisation, called the Satair Group, was incorporated this year and is a standalone subsidiary of Airbus.\n\nThe centre takes up 16,700 sq m and will triple the scope of parts handled and provide value-added materials management services. Tom Williams, Airbus executive vice-president programmes, said providing such services requires close working ties with clients.\n\n\"It's not just about giving them a box with a part in it, but being able to help them predict their requirements and thinking in advance,\" he said.\n\nWith the merger between the two groups, about 40 per cent of the centre's revenues and volumes are from non-Airbus parts.\n\nThe centre is now 60 per cent utilised. It has 120 employees, but can take up to 200, most of them skilled workers, said Mikkel Bardam, Satair Group's chief executive officer.\n\nThis is Airbus's third investment in the Seletar Aerospace Park. In 2011, it opened a helicopter maintenance, repair and overhaul facility. It followed this up with aircraft manufacturer ATR's flight training facility a year later.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the food solutions segment, it fell 3.9 per cent to $291.1 million, even as sales at its gateway services business grew 4.3 per cent to $173.3 million.\n\nRevenue from Singapore, which accounts for 78 per cent of the group's total, grew 2.5 per cent year on year to $362.9 million. Japan's contribution fell 18 per cent to $67.6 million. Aviation made up 78 per cent of total group revenue.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was flat at $137.8 million, as higher associate and joint-venture income helped offset a decline in operating profit, which fell 6.4 per cent to $129.3 million - largely as a result of rising manpower costs and the drop in revenue.\n\nHigher labour costs led to a 0.5 percentage point pullback in operating margins to 9.6 per cent from 10.1 per cent previously.\n\nRevenue slipped 1.3 per cent to $1.352 billion on lower food income, but this was offset by higher gateway collections.\n\nIn the nine-month period, the group benefited from a $4 million write-back of tax provisions for prior years, but this was offset by $1.7 million in impairment provisions.\n\nIn the third quarter, SATS saw a 4.8 per cent year-on-year growth in passengers handled, to 11.25 million, mostly driven by higher low-cost carrier traffic. Flights handled jumped 10.2 per cent, while unit services grew 6.6 per cent.\n\nBut gross and unit meals declined 8 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively, mainly because of the loss of Qantas flights to Europe.\n\nDuring an analysts and media conference call yesterday evening, SATS noted that associate and joint-venture incomegrew 7.4 per cent to $13 million in Q3. This, it said, was driven by strong growth in the middle class in Asia, led by the group's China and Indonesia operations.\n\nLooking ahead, the company said: \"The operating landscape for SATS remains challenging, in view of the ongoing pressure on airlines' profitability and rising labour costs.\"\n\nSATS said it expected modest growth in passenger traffic at Changi Airport in the near term and marginal growth in air freight at best.\n\nAs for its cruise business, SATS said there was a total of seven large cruise ships home porting at its Marina Bay Cruise Centre with 35 ship calls in Q3.\n\nThe group had announced last September its plans to acquire the Singapore Cruise Centre for $110 million. It is awaiting approvals from the Singapore Competition Commission and the Maritime Port Authority on the acquisition, and will seek shareholder approval for the purchase.\n\nSATS runs a network of food solution and gateway services facilities in 39 airports across 10 countries.\n\nThe group continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and short-term deposits of $355 million as at end-December, even after paying $168.4 million in dividend payments and reported free cashflow of $78.9 million in the nine-month period.\n\nThe counter ended three cents higher at $3.18 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has a step up of 100 basis points in February 2024.\n\nPrivate bank customers took up the bulk of the issue at 80 per cent, with the rest going to fund managers, banks and others.

Perpetuals, a cross between debt and equity, are treated as equity for accounting purposes.\n\nFunds raised will support the group's capital investment in industrial assets.\n\nJoint global coordinators and active book-runners on the transaction were Credit Suisse and DBS Bank; joint bookrunners were OCBC and Standard Chartered Bank and the co-manager was United Overseas Bank.\n\nFounded in 1993, the Trafigura group has become one of the world's major independent commodity traders, specialising in the oil, minerals and metals markets. Its primary trading activities are the supply and transport of oil and petroleum products and non-ferrous and bulk commodities.\n\nOwned by more than 700 of its almost 9,000 employees based in 58 countries, set up its Singapore office in 2012.\n\nFor the year ended Sept 30, 2013, it posted a turnover of US$133 billion, up 10 per cent.

Tapering also came into play during the recent bout of turmoil in emerging markets last month.\n\nBut analysts also cited another influence this time: the slowdown in China's economy. This could persist - and some analysts think it could intensify. Some celebrated investors such as George Soros believe that developments in China will be the biggest risk for the global economy in 2014, eclipsing the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nChina's economic growth last year came in at 7.7 per cent. This is good by global standards, but not by China's; in fact, it was close to a 14-year low. Beijing acknowledges that growth will need to moderate as part of the rebalancing of China's economy (from investment- led growth to consumption-led growth), which is an official goal of the government.\n\nBut there are fears that growth could seriously undershoot with the unwinding of some of the investment excesses that have goosed Chinese GDP numbers for most of the last decade. It stands to reason: as deleveraging intensifies, excess capacity (especially in capital goods) is absorbed and hidden losses - including those from latent bad loans - are recognised, growth will have to fall, even if productivity goes up. Soros aside, some of the more pessimistic observers of China's growth story - such as Michael Pettis, professor of finance at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management - believe that China's growth could slow to as little as 4 per cent for as long as a decade.\n\nWhile this is a minority view (although Prof Pettis is a recognised and respected expert on China's economy), even the majority of economists do not deny that China's growth will be 30-40 per cent below the average of the last two decades.\n\nEven leaving aside the possibility of accidents such as a real estate meltdown in some cities and debt defaults in China's shadow-banking system - which almost happened last month - the implications of China growing at closer to 6 per cent instead of 9 per cent for a decade are profound.\n\nChina is the biggest market for many commodities and energy; a slowdown (in particularly investment) will have ripple effects on commodity producers not only in the Asia Pacific, such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia, but also in areas as far afield as the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.\n\nA slower-growing China will also mean a domestic market in which foreign companies - from makers of automobiles to fast-moving consumer goods to luxury products - will face even more severe competition than they do now. Chinese companies may also accelerate their investments overseas as the climate at home gets tougher. The implications of all this for the financial markets remain to be seen, but they are unlikely to be pleasant. Thus even as the US and Europe recover, China's slowdown and its impact will bear close watching.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/family-foundations-let-rich-leave-legacy", "site_title": "Family foundations let rich leave legacy", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFamily foundations let rich leave legacy\n\nNon-profit foundations are increasing with more affluent families instilling right values in rich heirs\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSTEPHANIE Cordes, a graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, has a present from her father, Ron, that she treasures. It's a handmade pink scrapbook, titled, \"5 Life Lessons From Dad.\" Inside are whimsical photos of her with friends and family alongside typed pages containing his simple guidance. The chapters are: \"Seek your passion.\" \"Do your best.\" \"Good enough is never good enough.\" \"No excuses.\" \"Make a difference.\" \"Go for it.\" She was moved. But what really touched her was a letter he wrote to her last fall, which concluded with: \"You are my legacy.\" And she is, in more ways than one.\n\nIn mid-January, Ms Cordes, 24, quit what she had called her dream job, working at Conde Nast as an advertising sales assistant, to work full-time for the Cordes Foundation, the non-profit family foundation her father created when he and his two partners sold their firm, AssetMark Investment Services, to Genworth Financial in 2006 for US$230 million.\n\n\"I am going to be the legacy of the foundation,\" said Ms Cordes, who is an only child. \"It is really important that I am involved because it is going to be mine eventually.\" According to the most recent statistics, the number of family foundations like the Cordes Foundation has exploded since 2001. There are now more than 40,000 family foundations in the US, making grants totalling more than US$21.3 billion a year, up from about 3,200 family foundations doling out US$6.8 billion in 2001, according to the Foundation Center in Washington.\n\nThese non-profits are on the upswing for several reasons. First, friendly tax breaks make the charitable vehicle appealing. And it offers philanthropists who want more control over their giving a way to give with fewer restrictions than would come with a donor-advised fund or writing a cheque to an established charity.\n\nThen, too, there is often an underlying desire for baby boomers to instil in their children the significance of giving and compassion for those less privileged. A family foundation can curb a sense of entitlement that may come along with inheriting wealth.\n\nThe Council on Foundations defines a family foundation as one whose funds are derived from members of a single family. At least one family member must serve as an officer or board member of the foundation and as the donor.\n\nAnd you don't have to be a billionaire to create one. Sixty per cent of family foundations have assets of less than US$1 million.\n\n\"We are not the Gates Foundation,\" said Ron Cordes, 55, who started his foundation with US$10 million of the proceeds from the sale of his firm. \"We have several less zeros on our balance sheet.\" The challenge is \"trying to figure out how you can really have an impact with a somewhat more modest amount of money,\" he said.\n\n\"As a corporate CEO, I was involved in philanthropy,\" he added. \"My wife, Marty, and I gave money to lots of different things, but when I sold the company, I realised that I was able to open some personal bandwidth for myself that would give me an opportunity to have more direct participation in philanthropy.\"\n\nInstilling the value of giving back in their daughter was certainly part of the plan. Stephanie Cordes was 16 when her parents started the foundation. She knew that her father was selling the business, but she didn't have any concept of family wealth, or the amounts involved, Mr Cordes said. \"We never tried to push her into the foundation, but we wanted to put her in a position where those opportunities were available if she wanted to do them,\" he said.\n\nEstablishing the foundation has also allowed Mr Cordes, like many baby-boomers starting an encore career midlife, to ponder the question of how to \"move from success to significance,\" he said. \"How do you leave a legacy?\" Mr Cordes beams with pride that his daughter is committing herself to following that legacy and will soon take a seat on the foundation's board, which consists of her parents and four outside members. \"I cannot think of anything cooler than that,\" he said. Creating a foundation requires much more than money. Among other things, foundation founders must familiarise themselves with the myriad tax and other regulations involved and carve out the time required to review programmes for funding.\n\nTraditionally, the chief complaints about creating a family foundation have been the time and cost involved, but that seems to be getting under control as more firms specialising in advising families are cropping up.\n\nCosts vary by asset size and level of service and typically run the gamut from US$5,000 for a plain vanilla set-up to around US$35,000, said Elliot Berger, managing director of Arabella Advisors, a firm that specialises in philanthropic strategies and foundation management. Another, Advisors in Philanthropy, a non-profit based in Chicago, offers web seminars and other educational and networking opportunities. Ron and Marlys Boehm of Santa Barbara, California, were able to set up their US$1 million family foundation, the Boehm-Gladen Foundation, in three days for around US$10,000, with the help of Foundation Source, a private foundation advisory group, based in Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\n\"Our adviser made it very painless and quick,\" Mr Boehm said. \"Although family foundations have grown in popularity, we found there were still not a lot of advisers who are knowledgeable about the ins and outs,\" said Mr Boehm, 60, chairman, chief executive, and primary shareholder of the publishing firm ABC-CLIO.\n\nAnnual administration fees can range from 0.86 to 1.62 per cent of total assets, depending on the size of the fund and whether there's paid staff, according the 2013 Foundation Operations and Management Report by the Association of Small Foundations.\n\nAnd, by law, you must give away around 5 per cent of average monthly assets each year or face a 30 per cent excise tax on whatever portion of it has not been distributed within a year. Moreover, there's the Internal Revenue Service Form 990 to file annually. Net investment income of private foundations is generally taxed at 2 per cent but is often pared to 1 per cent through various tax strategies.\n\nThese IRS filings are not to be taken lightly. In the past, the tax agency has scrutinised family foundations for a variety of abuses, including family members paying themselves more than US$1 million to serve as foundation officers or charging exorbitant management fees. Bottom line: Auditors look for red flags that a family member is using funds as a personal piggy bank.\n\nA lack of privacy can be a problem with a family foundation; all of your information is public information, and your 990 tax form can be viewed by anyone - for example, via the Guidestar database.\n\nThe upside: \"The main advantage to a family foundation is control and flexibility,\" said Mr Berger of Arabella Advisors. \"You have control over who is on the board, how the money is granted, how it is managed.\" And you have the flexibility to convert the foundation to a public charity in order to attract other funders to a particular cause. If you no longer feel the need to have a foundation, you have the ability to transfer the assets to a donor-advised fund.\n\nIf you want to be anonymous, a donor-advised fund is better. A donor-advised fund allows you to create a charitable account, say US$5,000 to US$25,000, usually through a financial services firm, like a mutual fund or brokerage firm. You allocate grants under an umbrella name, like the Jones Family Fund, but it is not considered public information. You can also avoid the costs and headaches of creating a foundation.\n\nThe fund companies take care of most of the administration and management. The three titans are Fidelity Charitable, Vanguard Charitable and Schwab Charitable.\n\nThe drawback to a donor-advised fund is that you typically do not have as much say in specific investments, and the money must be earmarked for a recognised 501(c)(3) public charity that is United States-based. Also, there are rules about how many generations can participate in grant-making.\n\nFamily foundations can walk a tightrope. On the one hand, they can be a vehicle to teach heirs but on the other, with several siblings and multi-generations, infighting can present a thorny issue.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM", "images": []}

The carrier will take delivery of the first plane within this year. Separately, it will lease eight more A320 family aircraft from third-party lessors.\n\nThe privately owned VietJetAir, which commenced operations in 2011, has a fleet of 11 leased A320s covering 20 domestic and international routes. It has 26 per cent domestic market share in the country and started eking out a profit in its second year of operations.\n\nThe firming up of the order comes after the two companies agreed on a provisional order for largely A320 planes last year.\n\nChu Viet Cuong, member of the board at VietJetAir, said at a press briefing yesterday that the carrier would use the new aircraft to expand both domestically and in the region. It is setting up a joint venture airline together with Thailand's Kan Air, it said in June last year.\n\nAirbus - which is displaying its new A350 plane this week - said that it may announce an A380 order at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nIn an earlier press conference, Airbus management stressed that the Asia-Pacific would continue to fuel global demand for aircraft over the next two decades.\n\n\"(The region) is where the action will be for the industry in the coming years, not just in terms of aircraft sales but also support and industrial footprint,\" said Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, chief executive of Airbus. He also said that the company would grow its presence in Singapore.\n\nThe planemaker expects the region's carriers to take delivery of some 10,940 new passenger and cargo aircraft worth US$1.8 trillion from 2013-2032, or 37 per cent of the 29,200 planes required globally.\n\nIn its global market forecast, Airbus said that the fleet of aircraft used by Asia-Pacific carriers would more than double to over 12,130 jets by 2032, as airlines cater to the growing demand for travel.\n\nIn particular, Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy stressed the need for carriers to opt for larger, wide-body planes as passenger traffic trends upwards and airports struggle with infrastructure constraints.\n\nLast year, Airbus pipped rival Boeing to deliver about 331 new planes to the region, which is over half of all new planes entering service in the Asia-Pacific, while winning 80 per cent of all new business in the region with 379 firm orders.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will also be on static display as successful flight trials so far have earned it a few days off, said Fernando Alonso, senior vice-president for flight and integration tests.\n\nThe twin-aisle A350's appearance at Singapore is evidence that flight checks have advanced enough for Airbus to take the jet out of testing briefly. The aircraft, about half made from carbon fibre composites, has won 814 orders from 39 customers including Singapore Airlines and Japan Airlines. The region accounts for 30 per cent of the aircraft's total sales.\n\n\"It's been quite remarkable and way beyond our expectations,\" Mr Alonso told journalists here. \"We used to fly 50 to 55 hours a month\" on former flight tests programmes, he said. \"On the A350 we've been routinely flying 100 hours a month, because of the extremely good preparation\" done in advance of flights.\n\nAirbus first flew the jet on June 14 and conducted a fly-by days later at the Paris Air Show, the industry's highest-profile gathering. The plane at the Singapore show is one of the two aircraft already undergoing flight tests, and is filled with equipment for monitoring the performance.\n\nThe two test planes so far have logged 1,000 test hours, out of a total of about 2,500 hours required ahead of certification.\n\nThe A350 cabin was opened for inspection to journalists and some visitors on Monday, packed with test equipment and flight control displays that record and track as many as 600,000 parameters.\n\nThe model has very basic seating for about 50 people used usually by technicians, mechanics and support staff during tests.\n\nThe A350 has also been to Bolivia to test flying in high altitudes and to northern Canada to check its capacity to withstand cold temperatures, flying at minus 28 degrees centigrade, Mr Alonso said.\n\nAirbus has also allowed airline pilots to fly the plane. On Monday Mr Alonso's team shared the cockpit with two SIA pilots, giving them controls after half hour lessons, and in Doha, two Qatar pilots also took the controls, he said.\n\nAirbus has been hoping to get clearance from regulatory authorities in the US and Europe to have airlines fly the twin-engine plane wherever they like without having to stay near land in case one of the engines cease working.\n\nIn industry parlance, it's known as ETOPS, for extended twin operations. The Federal Aviation Administration in the US and the European Aviation Safety Authority must decide whether twin-engine commercial planes need to stay within 90 minutes, 120 minutes, or 180 minutes of the nearest airport - or whether the aircraft has shown sufficient reliability that it can fly beyond three hours from land.\n\nInitially, European and US authorities had agreed on required tests for giving unlimited ETOPS clearance. Recently the FAA wrote to Airbus, Mr Alonso said, to say it would impose stricter tests before allowing full ETOPS.\n\nThe harder line came after Boeing's 787 model suffered difficulties with lithium batteries, Mr Alonso said. - Bloomberg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The increase was mainly due to yuan appreciation, inflationary pressure and higher container throughput.\n\nStaff costs were also higher at HK$71.3 million, HK$7.9 million or 12.5 per cent more than last year, primarily resulting from yuan appreciation, inflationary pressure and increased staff after the acquisition of Asia Container Terminals Holdings (ACT) last year.\n\nInterest and other finance costs were HK$178.5 million, HK$30.7 million or 20.8 per cent above last year's.\n\nThe increase was mainly for additional interest expenses of HK$7.4 million for the HK$4 billion bank loan for the acquisition of ACT and write-off of the existing upfront fees upon the US$3.6 billion bank loan refinancing.\n\nThe decline in net profit and revenue for the fourth quarter contributed to a drop in the trust's full-year results as well. Its net profit for the 2013 financial year fell 25.1 per cent to HK$1.67 billion, compared to HK$2.24 billion the previous year. Revenue for the year also declined, by 0.3 per cent to HK$12.4 billion, due to lower container throughput at HIT and less concessions granted to some liners and a lower empty/laden container ratio at its Chinese terminals.\n\nEarnings per unit for the year was 19.23 HK cents compared to 25.68 HK cents in the previous year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

GENEVIEVE CUA reports\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nASSETS under management by the global fund management industry are expected to exceed US$101 trillion by 2020, thanks to growth in the emerging markets - specifically, South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East (SAAAME).\n\nPwC said in a new report that AUM growth in the SAAAME markets is expected to outpace the developed markets.\n\nThe report by PwC, Asset Management 2020 - A Brave New World, also envisions full transparency over investment activity and products, rising costs due to regulation, shifts in distribution dynamics and pressure on fees.\n\nGlobal AUM, currently at about US$64 trillion, is expected to grow at an annual compounded rate of nearly 6 per cent between now and 2020. This growth is expected to be underpinned by three key trends - an increase in mass affluent and high net worth individuals from the SAAAME economies; the expansion and emergence of sovereign wealth funds; and an increase in defined contribution schemes or individual retirement plans.\n\n\"SAAAME markets will provide opportunities for existing global asset managers to tap new pools of wealth and significantly expand their franchises . . . But it will equally provide the backdrop for a number of fast growing SAAAME-based competitors to emerge and not only take on the global managers in SAAAME regions, but in developed markets as well,\" said the report.\n\nThe biggest single contributor to the surge in mass affluent and HNWI assets is a rise in wealth levels. Mass affluent clients in SAAAME are projected to more than double their wealth between 2012 and 2020. By 2015, Asia is expected to be home to the highest proportion of middle class, and increasing affluence will likely fuel demand for financial products.\n\n\"Although the growing middle class represents low individual wealth, there is significant opportunity to serve that demographic if done thoughtfully and efficiently.\"\n\nThere are a number of challenges, however. One is increasing regulation, particularly as alternative asset managers fill in the void left by banks in areas such as primary lending, secondary debt market trading and off balance sheet financing.\n\nPwC reckons that by 2020 technology used by regulators may enable real-time access to portfolios of asset managers. This may be used to support oversight of market conduct and product appropriateness.\n\n\"Full transparency over investment activity and products will exist at all levels; there will be nowhere for non- compliant managers to hide as regulatory, tax and other information's reciprocal rights will extend across the globe.\"\n\nPwC said asset managers will have to build extensive \"know your customer\" and anti- money laundering systems to capture key tax data to be able to deal with automatic tax data provision - not only to the tax authority where the fund manager and the fund reside, but also to each tax authority where investors reside.\n\nManagers will also have to grapple with \"a huge jigsaw puzzle of tax residency definitions\" for potential investors, and different bases of taxation of investment income and capital gains in various jurisdictions.\n\nAll these are likely to demand a huge focus on spending on data and technology, which PwC expects to be crucial for fund managers in 2020.\n\nDistribution dynamics are also expected to shift. PwC expects that by 2020, the Asean initiative to allow recognition of mutual funds from Asean countries will be well-established. The original Asean platform of Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia will include Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nIt also said that the North Asia and South Asian regions will by 2020 have created initiatives to facilitate the cross-selling of funds. The Apec Asia Funds Passport initiative will be in existence with the first fund expected to be launched in 2016. By 2020, PwC expects Japan to join the grouping.\n\n\"As a result, the regional cross-border fund passporting regimes will by 2020 start to enter inter-regional bilateral agreements, paving the way for an integrated passport at a quasi global level and allowing asset managers to distribute products across Asia.\"\n\nBan on commissions\n\nFee models are expected to be transformed, driven partly by regulation to align the interests of the manager with those of the investor. The UK's Retail Distribution Review, whose recommendations went into force last year, is one such regulation seeking to reduce and end potential conflicts of interest. It bans product commissions to financial advisers.\n\nPwC believes that by 2020, the RDR or similar regulations will apply to all major markets including Asia. In Singapore, the Financial Advisory Industry Review last year did not seek to ban commissions, but it sought to require disclosure of trail fees - the portion of the annual management fee that is paid to the financial adviser.\n\nAlready, versions of the RDR have been created in India and Australia, and are in the process of creation in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and South Africa, said PwC.\n\nThe impact of this, said PwC's report, is that more self-directed services are likely to be offered to the mass affluent customers, as it becomes too costly to service retail investors.\n\nThis suggests that online retail platforms will benefit. \"It will drive a lower cost model across the (asset management) spectrum, since a whole raft of commissions will be taken out of the structure.\"\n\nIt adds that the absence of distribution commissions based on a management fee will eliminate incentives for distributors to sell products with high expense ratios \"that have no incremental value, further opening up the market for passive and other low-cost products such as ETFs\".\n\nPassive investments are expected to grow to US$22.7 trillion, from US$7.2 trillion currently.\n\nOn alternative investments, PwC expects that a wider range of investors - including retail - will be able to access them as regulators allow specific vehicles such as alternative mutual funds in the US to be more widely distributed. Alternative assets are expected to grow by 9.3 per cent a year between now and 2020, to reach US$13 trillion.\n\ngen@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The index is now 12.8 per cent above the market's previous peak in late 2007.\n\nQV said limits on how much banks can lend on low deposit-high value house loans, imposed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) in October, appeared to be having an effect. \"These speed limits have reduced the number of first home buyers active in the market, but perhaps more importantly have led to increased caution amongst buyers,\" said QV research director Jonno Ingerson. Auckland region prices were up 14.5 per cent in the year to January from a 15.4 per cent rate the month before, while Christchurch slowed to a 12 per cent gain from 12.7 per cent.\n\nMr Ingerson said the prospect of higher home loan rates as the RBNZ tightens policy, most likely from next month, may already be affecting confidence, and when they come will slow prices further. The RBNZ said in its January statement that it expected to start raising rates from a record low 2.5 per cent \"soon\", which most economists interpret as March. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

After all, why leave the established Seletar Aerospace Park in Singapore to resettle operations across the Johor Strait?\n\nBut Executive Jets Asia (EJA), a start-up co-owned by aviation specialist Prithpal Singh and businessman David Ho, took that plunge in early 2011.\n\n\"We could not get suitable land at a financially viable cost to build our own hangar at Seletar,\" Mr Singh recalled. \"Meanwhile, Senai Airport had just set up its Senai Aviation Park in 2011, catering to business aviation. As we were the first to approach them, they offered us very favourable terms for airside apron/runway facing prime land at the airport to build our facility. While there was only rentable land in Seletar, Senai offered to sell us land.\"\n\nToday, EJA owns 1.82 hectares of prime runway fronting land on a 45-year lease. It recently opened its 110,000 square foot fbo/office/hangar complex on a 1.01-hectare plot, which can take in two Airbus 320 aircraft and a number of smaller business jets at the same time.\n\nIn all, the company has invested some RM35 million (S$13.3 million) to date in land, facilities and equipment.\n\nMr Singh said the new facility allows EJA to go into the maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) business, third-party aircraft hangarage, fixed base operation (FBO) services, aircraft management and other aviation services.\n\nWhen The Business Times made a visit, there were several private jets parked in its hangar.\n\n\"We have locked in our costs for the next 45 years. And our billings are in US dollars, but our costs are in ringgit. It's a great investment for us as we believe that the demand for prime hangars and aviation services such as ours will continue to grow strongly.\"\n\nBesides executive jet charters, the company operates Flying Doctors Asia, a medical evacuation (medivac) business.\n\nWhile EJA's overall business has grown some 20 per cent annually since 2011, the medivac unit has seen much stronger take-off.\n\n\"On average we handle about 40 medivacs a month, and it now accounts for almost 90 per cent of our income,\" Mr Singh said. \"Demand comes from everywhere around the Asia-Pacific, though the majority is from Indonesia.\"\n\nBesides a medivac-dedicated Westwind Gulfstream, EJA operates three dry-leased Hawker 700 jets capable of both medivac and charter flights. They operate using Thai and Philippine air operators certificates (AOC).\n\nMr Singh expects EJA to get its Malaysian AOC next month, following which it will take more leased jets from local owners.\n\nSince setting up base at the privately owned airport, EJA has taken on a Malaysian partner, in keeping with local requirements. Staff and technicians are sourced from aviation and technical colleges in Malaysia, while the company's pilots and crew are housed in bungalows near the airport.\n\nPlans are under way to build a second hangar on its remaining 0.81-ha plot, facilities which EJA believes will enable it to scale up and offer MRO services, hangarage for third-party business jets and aircraft management business.\n\n\"All this in addition to growing our own air charter business,\" Mr Singh said, adding that Senai's proximity to Singapore gives EJA's operations an advantage. \"We are only one hour by road from the Senai Airport to the Singapore CBD.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translates to earnings per share of 2.17 Hong Kong cents, down from 4.15 Hong Kong cents.\n\nRevenue inched up 2 per cent to HK$2.4 billion.\n\nBecause of lower sales volume, revenue for its biggest frozen fish business - which sources and imports fish and provides logistical support to commercial fishing vessels - fell 16 per cent to HK$1.3 billion, while that for its contract supply business fell 34 per cent to HK$459.7 million.\n\nThe fishery and fish supply division was the only bright spot, where revenue grew 34 per cent to HK$1.13 billion, thanks to contribution from Copeinca, Peru's second-largest fishing company.\n\nPard's other operating income tumbled to HK$85.2 million from HK$184.9 million, mainly because of a HK$107.9 million fair-value gain on derivative contracts that was recognised last year.\n\nAt the same time, administrative expenses went up 78 per cent to HK$66.9 million, while finance costs grew 44 per cent to HK$202.3 million, as a result of a consolidation of Copeinca's results and senior notes, as well as a bridging loan drawn to finance the acquisition.\n\nThe write-off of a fishing vessel that sank in Q1 also caused other operating expenses to balloon to HK$47.7 million from HK$8 million a year ago.\n\nStripping out the exceptional gains a year ago, net profit attributable to owners would have grown 13.9 per cent, the company said.\n\n\"Our strategy of acquisition and consolidation of business in Peru is translating into strong growth for the group,\" said group managing director Ng Joo Siang. \"We will continue to integrate our enlarged fishmeal operations during the second quarter of FY2014 to realise the full benefit from the synergies from our acquisition of Copeinca when the 2014 first (fishing) season commences in April/May 2014.\"\n\nFor China Fishery Group, in which Pard has a 70 per cent stake, net profit grew 8 per cent to US$14.8 million on the back of a 34 per cent increase in revenue to US$145.2 million.\n\nEarnings per share stood at 0.72 of a US cent a share, down from 1.33 US cents a share a year ago. The company had doubled the number of its issued and paid-up shares with a rights issue last April.\n\nWhile China Fishery Group benefited from Copeinca's revenue contribution, expenses were inflated from the consolidation of Copeinca's results.\n\nBut realised gains from foreign exchange derivative contracts and gains from disposal of property, plant and equipment boosted its other operating income, which rose 72 per cent to US$6.4 million, raising the bottom line.\n\nPard shares ended 0.2 cent lower at 13.7 cents, while China Fishery closed three cents lower at 43 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She repeated the Fed's outlook for further reductions in asset purchases and said they are not on a \"pre-set course\".\n\nShe spoke days after a government report showed the jobless rate unexpectedly declined almost to the Fed's threshold for considering an increase in the benchmark interest rate, even as payrolls growth was weaker than forecast.\n\nMs Yellen said the unemployment rate alone isn't an adequate gauge of labour-market health.\n\n\"Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part-time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high,\" she noted. \"These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the US labour market.\"\n\nMs Yellen also said that the Fed has been \"watching closely\" volatility in global financial markets and that \"our sense is that at this stage, these developments do not pose a substantial risk to the US economic outlook\". She used her testimony to praise her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, for helping \"make our economy and financial system stronger\" and said she'd continue his strategy.\n\n\"I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC's approach to monetary policy,\" Ms Yellen said, adding that she served on the Federal Open Market Committee \"as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy\".\n\nThe Fed said in December that it would start reducing the monthly pace of asset purchases, citing progress toward its goal of full employment. It announced a US$10 billion reduction that month, followed by a cut of the same size in January, to US$65 billion.\n\nThe central bank has said it will keep buying bonds until the outlook for the labour market has \"improved substantially\". Fed policy makers have also sought to reassure investors that while they are tapering bond purchases, they still intend to hold the Fed's target rate near a record low.\n\nBeginning in December 2012, the FOMC said it would keep the rate near zero \"at least as long\" as the unemployment level was above 6.5 per cent. At their December 2013 meeting, it strengthened that statement, saying the rate is likely to stay near zero until \"well past the time\" unemployment falls below 6.5 per cent, a strategy Ms Yellen repeated yesterday.\n\nUnemployment in January fell to 6.6 per cent, the lowest since October 2008, from 6.7 per cent, a Labour Department report showed last week.\n\nJob growth in December and January was the weakest of any two-month period in the past three years.\n\n\"They thought if the rate fell to this level, you'd be seeing a lot more job growth and economic growth,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, and a former Richmond Fed economist. \"The Fed is viewing the totality of data as suggesting the labour market is not as healthy as they thought it would be when we got to that 6.5 per cent threshold.\"\n\nThe FOMC doesn't meet again until March 18-19. By then, it will have an additional month of economic data, including the jobs report for February.\n\nMs Yellen took over as Fed chairman on Feb 3 after serving for three years as Mr Bernanke's deputy. She has supported the bond purchases that expanded the Fed's balance sheet to a record US$4.1 trillion. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Instead, they expect the measures to stay, with some predicting a reversal only next year.\n\nThe exemption also applies to investment property loans, though the borrowers must go through with refinancing by June 30, 2017, and commit to a debt-reduction plan at the point of refinancing.\n\nLast year, the MAS said that 5-10 per cent of borrowers here risk being over-leveraged - defined as having a DSR of more than 60 per cent - and that this proportion could rise to between 10 and 15 per cent if mortgage rates edge up three percentage points.\n\nHSBC analyst Pratik Ray said in a report: \"Refinance holds will be problematic if the TDSR framework is applied - and an increase in interest rates or loan margins would increase their repayment burden, resulting in possible forced sales.\"\n\nCiti analyst Adrian Chua said in a note that stretched borrowers have been held to ransom by lenders in the post-TDSR period.\n\nCredit Suisse analysts Yvonne Voon and Anand Swaminathan, concurring, wrote in a report: \"Post-TDSR, banks raised their spreads, taking the view that the borrower would have no choice but to stay with the current bank\", given that refinancing could mean a breach of TDSR.\n\nCredit Suisse estimates that 40 per cent of property-owners qualify for the TDSR exemption, which took effect immediately on Monday. However, under 20 per cent of them are actually hit, because, given the low interest rates in the last three years, most of them would have already refinanced their loans.\n\nMortgage rates typically have a lower spread to the Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor) in the first two or three years, but jump from the fourth year, noted Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng in a report. This has prompted borrowers to undertake refinancing in the third year to enjoy \"teaser\" rates again.\n\nHe questioned whether there was a larger proportion of borrowers deep in debt than earlier envisioned. The MAS had said this year that one in five borrowers (20 per cent) has a DSR of 40-60 per cent.\n\nMr Kit believes the proportion to be higher; as much as 25-30 per cent of existing borrowers may already have a DSR of more than 40 per cent at the current low interest rates, he said.\n\n\"Even if household balance sheet data suggests more cash than debt on aggregate, the new exemption may hint at a skewed distribution of debt.\"\n\nAs a whole, analysts predict that regulators would create a cushion for a \"soft-deleveraging\". Since short-term interest rates are still low, any \"meaningful policy reversal\" would come only late next year, HSBC said.\n\nLooking at the impact on banks, Credit Suisse analysts said that the TDSR tweak should boost refinancing volumes - which has historically made up a third of the new-loan market - but may also hit the banks' margins.\n\nStill, DMG & Partners Securities said in a report that these exemptions are unlikely to stem the decline in new property transactions.\n\nRecent bank-lending data has signalled weakness in the housing loan market. The net gain in value of all Sing-dollar denominated housing loans was 9.5 per cent in December last year, compared to a year ago, according to preliminary estimates by the MAS. This is poorer than the 15.9 per cent year-on-year growth at the end of 2012.\n\nDMG & Partners remains \"neutral\" on the banking sector. Shares of DBS closed flat yesterday at $16.38; UOB was up 0.2 per cent at $19.87, and OCBC gained 0.3 per cent to end at $9.40.\n\nCredit Suisse likes developers with more overseas and less residential exposure, such as CapitaLand and CapitaMalls Asia (CMA). Shares of CapitaLand rose 1.4 per cent to $2.88, and CMA gained 0.3 per cent to $1.745.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/piracy-both-good-and-bad-news", "site_title": "Piracy: both good and bad news", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nPiracy: both good and bad news\n\nThe situation is better off the Horn of Africa - but much worse off West Africa\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE good news is that the Somali pirates are having a hard time; the bad news is that their counterparts in West Africa are increasingly having a good time.\n\nIt certainly is encouraging that piracy at sea has reached its lowest levels in six years, according to recently released International Maritime Bureau (IMB) figures. There were 264 attacks recorded worldwide in 2013 - a 40 per cent drop since Somali piracy peaked in 2011. Of these, 15 incidents were reported off Somalia in 2013, down from 75 in 2012, and 237 in 2011.\n\nLast year, Somali pirates hijacked two vessels, both of which were released within a day as a result of naval actions but no vessels were taken into Somali territorial waters. A further eight vessels were fired upon. These figures are the lowest since 2006, when 10 Somali attacks were recorded.\n\nBefore we get carried away with the good news, it is a sobering thought that at least 50 crew members taken off ships by Somali pirates are believed to be still held ashore.\n\nIt is also important to remember that the Somalis have been unsuccessful in the past year only because of large-scale and effective naval intervention and the widespread use of armed guards. The pirates are still there and still doing their best to hijack ships. The moment merchant ships ease up on their expensive protective measures or the navies start to pull back, we will once again see ships languishing off Somalia's coast.\n\nAs IMB director Pottengal Mukundan warns: \"It is imperative to continue combined international efforts to tackle Somali piracy. Any complacency at this stage could rekindle pirate activity.\"\n\nStopping hijackings in the Indian Ocean is the only real success story. IMB's annual Global Piracy Report shows more than 300 people were taken hostage at sea last year and 21 were injured, nearly all with guns or knives. A total of 12 vessels were hijacked, 202 were boarded, 22 were fired upon, and a further 28 reported attempted attacks.\n\nIMB says Nigerian pirates were particularly violent, killing one crew member, and kidnapping 36 people to hold onshore for ransom. All of the hostages have been released. IMB told BT that it believes a significant number of incidents off Nigeria are not being reported.\n\nWest African piracy made up 19 per cent of attacks worldwide last year. Nigerian pirates and armed robbers accounted for 31 of the region's 51 attacks, taking 49 people hostage and kidnapping 36 - more than in any year since 2008. Nigerian pirates ventured far into waters off Gabon, Ivory Coast and Togo, where they were linked with at least five of the region's seven reported vessel hijackings. Off the coast of Nigeria itself, two ships were hijacked, 13 were boarded and 13 fired upon.\n\nIn January, the 75,000 dwt Liberian-flagged tanker Kerala was reported hijacked off Luanda, Angola. The ship reappeared off Nigeria, after part of her cargo had been stolen, and was taken to Tema, Ghana. The Nigeria and Angolan authorities have expressed doubts as to whether it was a genuine hijacking. However, a Liberian Flag Administration investigation, carried out by Interpol, has found that the ship was indeed hijacked, on Jan 18. During the hijacking, one crew member was stabbed by the pirates and others were beaten.\n\nDuring the hijacking, the pirates disabled the vessel's AIS (automatic identification system) and other communication equipment so that the vessel could not be tracked from shore or satellite. The pirates painted over the identifying features of the vessel, including funnel, name and IMO number, and undertook three separate ship-to-ship transfers of cargo amounting to the theft of more than 12,000 tonnes of cargo.\n\nSo, at the moment it looks like we are (just about) winning off the Horn of Africa - and starting to lose big time off West Africa.\n\nBut just in case piracy is regarded as a uniquely African problem, two product tankers were hijacked in Malaysian waters last year, with 27 crew members taken hostage and the ships' property and cargo stolen.\n\nAnd the number of thefts and armed robberies in Indonesian anchorages and waters increased in 2013, and especially in the last three months of the year. While IMB described most incidents as \"low-level opportunistic thefts, not to be compared with the more serious incidents off Africa\", these accounted for more than 50 per cent of all vessels boarded worldwide last year, and armed robbery increased for a fourth consecutive year.\n\nIMB says its Piracy Reporting Centre has been working closely with the Indonesian Marine Police, who have increased maritime patrols and designated safe anchorage areas for vessels to use in certain higher-risk ports.\n\nAll in all, piracy remains an acute problem for the industry, and we need remind the rest of the world that seafarers are still at risk. Indeed, about 50 have apparently been left to their fate in Somalia - a situation that can only be described as shameful.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will be possible with the help of the Aviation Maintenance Trainer (AMT).\n\nIt is an immersive 3D training system for aircraft maintenance crew that can give an exact but virtual representation of an aircraft and its equipment.\n\nTogether with virtual reality software provider EON Reality and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) company MAJ Aviation, Aviation Virtual has fronted the project since two months ago. Aviation Virtual provides virtual reality training solutions and is a subsidiary of MAJ Aviation, a local small and medium-sized enterprise (SME).\n\nMAJ Aviation's CEO Khoo Beng Keat says it can improve training efficiency by around 30 per cent. Priced between $500,000 and $1 million, depending on how detailed it is, the AMT will also reduce training costs as there is no need to dedicate a real aircraft for training purposes, says Mr Khoo.\n\nShaped like a cave, the system utilises the EON Icube virtual reality system, which gives it a highly realistic spatial representation of the aircraft and its surroundings. This is combined with Aviation Virtual's customised training management system to drive the Icube's operational use, and monitor progress of the trainee.\n\nWithin the space of the training unit, the eyeline of the trainee will be tracked while he moves via a pair of goggles he is wearing in order to provide a dynamic viewing perspective. This perspective can be shared by others with the multiple-goggles system, allowing the instructor to observe alongside. Additionally, the AMT will see hand and finger gestures replace hand-held controllers.\n\n\"It will literally bring the industry to the classroom and make the transition between learning and doing seamless,\" said Chong Chee Leong, Aviation Virtual's managing director. Mr Khoo added that while current training systems make use of computers with 3D technology, they are \"very much 2D in nature\". Such systems are not life-size and cannot provide trainees with a spatial learning experience, unlike a virtual 3D modelling system, he said.\n\n\"Part of the training is about the person's mind and his physical interaction, in terms of hands and his position with respect to objects and parts of an aircraft,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The facility undertakes scheduled and unscheduled maintenance work, modifications and avionics installations.\n\nSince it started operations three months ago, the centre has done more than 40 jobs, more than half of which were for unplanned maintenance, said Mark Masluch, Bombardier Aerospace's public relations manager. The Economic Development Board and JTC Corporation worked with Bombardier to get the necessary land and authorisation permits for the centre, and hooked the company up with the relevant networks.\n\nGary Martin, the vice-president of sales, marketing and service programmes, said Bombardier picked Singapore as the site for its Asia-Pacific service centre - the company's 10th worldwide and only the second outside North America - because of its customer base, geographic advantage and healthy business climate.\n\nEDB assistant managing director Lim Kok Kiang said Bombardier's decision lent weight to Singapore's position as the leading aerospace hub in the region.\n\nThe service centre will also add jobs to the aerospace sector. Bombardier has signed a five-year partnership with Singapore Polytechnic so that its staff and students can get real-world training.\n\nSP's deputy principal Lim Peng Hun said: \"The collaboration . . . is a significant development for SP, especially in nurturing the students of Diploma in Aeronautical Engineering and Diploma in Aerospace Electronics, who can be ever-ready to contribute to the bullish aerospace industry in Singapore.\"\n\nThere are now about 250 jets based in Greater China, India and the Asia-Pacific.

While they have all been affected by global economic tides, these nations are facing crises because of problems in their national governance. And if we look elsewhere around the world, we find that governance has been re-emerging as a major factor behind success or failure in many emerging nations.\n\nIt's not that macroeconomic quandaries have gone away in all of those countries. There are still many such issues: how to deal with current account deficits, for example, or how to face the consequences of tighter US monetary policy.\n\nBut these concerns were foreseeable, and some countries have been meeting them, if imperfectly, while others are letting these problems push them over the precipice. In this context, good governance means directing political energies at strengthening the economy rather than trying to cement power and keep down the opposition.\n\nThis new world contrasts with two earlier waves of change. The first started in the 1990s, when a rising China bought and invested in raw materials at an unheard-of pace. That flow of purchasing power was so strong that it brought better times to other emerging nations, including many in South America and Africa, regardless of whether the individual countries had good governance in place.\n\nThe second major wave was the recent global recession, which damaged the commercial prospects of many nations.\n\nFor instance, in the first quarter of 2009, the gross domestic product of Singapore fell at an annualized rate of 8.9 per cent. That wasn't because Singapore had bad economic policy but because exports were hit by a global downturn beyond the country's control.\n\nThe two waves have had such noticeable effects that we've become unaccustomed to evaluating political fundamentals in individual nations.\n\nBut these waves, though not quite over, have slowed. Many of the advanced economies have returned to financial normalcy, albeit with stunted employment. And the Chinese growth juggernaut is slowing. Let's consider the role of governance in four countries facing some of the most pressing crises:\n\nWhat is striking about these stories is how rooted they are in each country's daily internal struggles. Indonesia, India, South Africa, Brazil and Russia also appear vulnerable - and, again, it's largely because of an inability to solve domestic problems; it's not primarily because they have been whipsawed by unstoppable global trends.\n\nBut by no means are all emerging countries headed down such dangerous paths. Chile, Mexico and Malaysia are a few more positive examples. They have persistent problems, but the economic data in each case indicates a brighter future.\n\nMexico, for instance, has had a marked economic slowdown, but it has pressed forward with liberalising its energy sector and has begun some much-needed reforms to primary education. Drug-related violence is worsening in Michoac\u00e1n, but subsiding in some northern cities. Democracy appears robust.\n\nIt's not yet clear how to characterise China, as far as governance goes. For all of its economic progress, there are still many signs of dysfunction in political institutions, like corruption among the party elite and an unwillingness to take on state-owned factories and energy companies to fight worsening air pollution.\n\nIt's also not clear whether the Chinese are succeeding at rebalancing their economy towards consumption. Most important, we don't know how robust its political system would be in a serious economic downturn. Yet China is important enough globally that if its economy imploded, many other nations would have crises, too, no matter what they did on their own.\n\nSo we're now at a point where many global macroeconomic factors have been muted.

The situation could worsen this year, in anticipation of interest rates rising; higher borrowing costs amid rising leverage could weaken the asset quality of the banks here.\n\nIvan Tan, S&P's primary credit analyst, wrote in the report: \"We believe Singapore banks could face tighter credit conditions, especially if the US Federal Reserve's tapering of its bond purchase programme leads to an increase in interest rates and a higher debt-servicing burden for the corporate and household sectors.\"\n\nS&P estimates that the household debt burden in Singapore, as measured by a ratio of household debt to GDP, rose from 66.7 per cent in 2008 to 77.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, turning Singapore into one of the highest household indebted economies in Asia.\n\n\"The increase in household debt and corporate sector leverage reflects the prevailing low interest rates and availability of easy financing, in our opinion. The multi-industry and commerce sectors are the only segments where leverage has not gone up.\n\n\"Supportive economic conditions have also spurred the demand for debt, and the banks are happy to lend because they are flush with funds from easy monetary conditions,\" the report stated.\n\nHowever, high property prices, pushing down housing affordability, have made the scenario riskier for banks; this can undermine the credit quality of mortgages, which, at about 25 per cent of total loans, make for the largest industry exposure for Singapore banks.\n\nNevertheless, in its base-case scenario, S&P expects the Singapore banking sector's asset quality to remain resilient. It believes that Singapore banks have sufficient buffer against a gradual rise in interest rates.\n\nIt also said that leading indicators of unemployment and bankruptcy are likely to remain low in Singapore, which will support strong household and corporate balance sheets.\n\nHowever, the potential for ratings upgrades for Singapore banks appears limited; S&P believes the banks will find it difficult to significantly boost profitability and capitalisation.\n\nIts report said: \"Strategic missteps, such as overly aggressive loan growth and overseas expansion, would heighten the likelihood of losses and lead to significant capital impairment, in our opinion, which could trigger downgrades - an unlikely scenario.\n\n\"Generally speaking, we believe banks' performance will remain healthy and that credit quality will hold firm.\"\n\nThe credit-rating agency believes, however, that Singapore banks' overseas expansion this year will be muted even if they look into emerging markets for higher yields.\n\n\"Economic woes and political uncertainties in regional economies such as India and Thailand are likely to dampen Singapore banks' acquisition appetite. Foreign ownership restrictions are also common in most emerging economies, and some are becoming more protective of their banking systems. Indonesia provides a case in point,\" said the report.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bimco chief shipping analyst Peter Sand, for one, believes that prospects are brightening.\n\n\"We are definitely seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. The recent glimpse of sun in capesize and VLCC (very large crude carrier) segments, the slowing demolition activity and new building ordering gaining traction are all bullish signs,\" said Mr Sand. \"With the global economy recovering, the optimistic outlook of the shipping market has never been clearer than now.\"\n\nSpeakers at next month's APM include Mr Cazzulo, Mr Sand, Chris Faulkner, CEO of Breitling Oil and Gas, Thomas Kriwat, CEO of Mercantile Shipping Company, Jeremy Nixon, CEO of NYK Line, Yang Chang Kun, managing director of shipping at ICBI Bank in China, among others.\n\nThe theme of the event is \"Repositioning for Growth in the Asia Pacific Region\". The conference will bring together about 1,500 international maritime companies from 53 countries and 15,000 visitors to attend an exhibition, conference sessions, and a host of networking events which connect Asia-Pacific buyers with international maritime suppliers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Jakarta-based company said on Monday it's planning an initial public offering for Citilink. Mr Satar declined to name the four bidders.\n\nGetting a strategic partner and raising funds will help Garuda compete with PT Lion Mentari Airlines in a market where passenger numbers are expected to increase as much as 20 per cent this year. From Indonesia to Vietnam to Myanmar, carriers in South-east Asia are also buying aircraft as about 600 million people - as many as the combined population of the US, Germany and Brazil - fly more.\n\n\"The budget market is growing quite fast in Indonesia,\" Mr Satar told Bloomberg Television. \"We feel we need a partner who is really experienced in terms of driving the low-cost carrier.\"\n\nCitilink operates 30 aircraft for 70 routes across the Indonesian archipelago, according to company figures. Standard Chartered Bank Plc and Bahana Securities Ltd are advising Garuda on the stake sale, Mr Satar said.\n\nThe emergence of low-cost carriers such as Lion Air and AirAsia Bhd have helped fuel demand for flying in South-east Asia as tickets get cheaper. Lion Air and Sepang, Malaysia-based AirAsia have together ordered 764 planes worth US$73.8 billion at list prices since 2011.\n\nBy the end of this year, Lion Air and state-controlled Garuda will surpass Singapore Airlines Ltd as the region's biggest carriers by fleet size, the CAPA Centre for Aviation, which advises airlines, said last year.\n\n\"Ten years ago there were no low-cost carriers in Asia or South-east Asia,\" Randy Tinseth, Boeing Co's vice-president for marketing, said yesterday at a press conference. \"The growth is even more dynamic in South-east Asia, where today low-cost carriers provide 22 per cent of available seats. That'll grow to represent about 42 per cent of seats\" in 2032, he said.\n\nIndonesia overtook its former colonial master, the Netherlands, in 2011 to become the world's 16th-largest economy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If it maintains a growth rate of about 6 per cent, it will leapfrog Germany and the UK by 2030 to rank seventh, consulting firm McKinsey & Co predicts.\n\nGaruda's net income fell to US$11.04 million in 2013 from US$110.6 million a year earlier, due to depreciation in the rupiah, which weakened 21 per cent last year, and higher operating costs. About half the company's revenue was in foreign currencies and about 60 per cent of its costs were in dollars, Mr Satar told a press conference on Monday. The company will try to lift dollar revenue to match expenses, he said.\n\nCitilink will do better this year and not incur a loss, Mr Satar said. Garuda plans to add 30 aircraft this year and take its fleet to about 250 by the end of 2025, from 194 planes by the end of 2015, he said. The company is looking to buy wide-bodied aircraft and considering Boeing's 787 Dreamliner as it expands internationally.\n\nThe carrier will start flights to London and Mumbai and increase flights to China and Japan. \"We should not read too much on their 2013 numbers, which were affected by the rupiah,\" Shukor Yusof, an analyst at Standard & Poor's in Singapore, said on Tuesday. \"Once they announce new orders and increase the network into Europe, things will turn around.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Last February, MinLaw had said that some of these golf courses will have to be phased out and the greens put to other uses. Most operate on 30-year leases, the majority of which will expire between 2021 and 2030.\n\n\"There will be no new land allocations for golf courses,\" the Ministry said yesterday, in response to media queries on whether Keppel will be offered an alternative site when its current lease expires in 2021.\n\nKeppel's golf course sits on prime land in the Telok Blangah area, but has been reflected as a residential site as early as the Urban Redevelopment Authority's 2001 Concept Plan. Golf courses are meant to sit on land zoned for sports and recreation.\n\nA second consideration for the government, when looking at renewals of golf course leases, is whether the general public, National Service men and the labour movement have enough access to golfing facilities.\n\n\"The Marina Bay Golf Course is an 18-hole public course whose lease will expire in 2024. As the site is zoned for commercial and residential uses, the government will find a replacement site for a public course,\" MinLaw said.\n\nIt added that it \"should come as no surprise\" that at least one of the SICC's locations - Bukit, next to MacRitchie Reservoir, or Island, near Upper and Lower Peirce Reservoirs - may be affected. The lease held by SICC, whose four 18-hole golf courses cover the largest acreage of land among the 11 private golf clubs, also expires in 2021.\n\nAs for TMCC and NSRCC, both clubs' courses may have to be reconfigured to accommodate Changi Airport's expansion plans. According to the URA's Draft Master Plan released late last year, parts of NSRCC's course are designated as a reserve site, for which specific use has not been fixed.\n\n\"The meetings this Sunday are to explain the decisions and address members' concerns in person. Thereafter we will make the announcement public. These will be for courses whose leases are ending in the next 10 years. We are doing this seven years in advance so that the clubs will be in a better position to make their investment and membership plans,\" MinLaw said.\n\nThe 11 private clubs have about 30,000 members, who hold an estimated $3 billion worth of golf club memberships. Open-market prices of transferrable golf club memberships have tumbled in recent years, hit by the uncertainty over lease renewals.\n\nClubs have also put off development plans. After Raffles Country Club members voted down a $26-million plan to revamp one of its golf courses in September last year, SLA urged golf clubs to base investment decisions only on the outstanding tenure of their lease.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

New York state's top bank regulator in late January revealed plans to regulate businesses handling transactions in bitcoin this year.\n\nThe bitcoin price started falling fast on Friday when Mt Gox said it was temporarily halting withdrawals due to unexplained technical issues.\n\nMt Gox said withdrawals were on hold indefinitely after it \"detected unusual activity on its bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of transactions which need to be examined more closely\". It said a \"bug in the bitcoin software\" could allow transaction details to be altered.\n\nIn effect, someone on the network could alter transaction details to make it appear a transfer of bitcoins from one digital wallet to another had not occurred when in fact it had. This might cause the transfer to be repeated. A bitcoin wallet is an application that stores bitcoins for the currency's users.\n\nMt Gox said the issue was not limited to the exchange and \"affects all transactions where bitcoins are being sent to a third party\". It said the withdrawal suspension would be in effect until the issue has been resolved.\n\n\"With the volatility in the currency being as much as it is, it's going to take some time before we get enough of a comfort level from investors and merchants to enable it to be used ubiquitously,\" said Darrin Peller, managing director at Barclays in New York.\n\nThe arrest of a prominent bitcoin advocate just over two weeks ago threw a spotlight on the currency.\n\nCharlie Shrem, 24, operator of the Bitinstant bitcoin exchange company, was charged by US prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road.

Fears of rising interest rates caused outflows from emerging markets, a theme that is persisting with the Fed continuing to taper its bond purchases.\n\nStocks which have fallen the most are property counters with assets in China, \"right smack in two concerns recently\", CIMB research head Kenneth Ng told The Business Times.\n\n\"Tapering fears mean rising interest rates - which is bad for property,\" he said.\n\n\"There are also fears over China's shadow banking. If any of these trust products default, this means the potential for a series of other defaults. A lot of these trust products ultimately fund property in China.\"\n\nMost stocks which underperformed the STI's price decline of 13.4 per cent between May 22 and Feb 3 were property-related. Real estate giant CapitaLand, CapitaMall Asia, which develops malls in Asia, and CapitaLand's real estate investment trusts (Reits), CapitaCommercial Trust and CapitaMall Trust, were all hit.\n\nOther property names, such as Keppel Land, Keppel Reit, Ascendas Reit, UOL, Singapore Land and City Developments also performed badly, along with the Jardine stable of stocks. They were down between 14 and 28 per cent in total returns.\n\nOCBC Investment Research head Carmen Lee warned that it might be too early to start buying into property stocks.\n\n\"Property stocks may have a little bit more downside, especially if official property data remains weak. With the current weak market confidence, my preference is still for oil-and-gas stocks like Keppel and Ezion, as well as DBS,\" she said.\n\nThe FTSE ST Oil and Gas Index has remained relatively resilient, she noted.\n\nReits and yield-related stocks have also suffered because of market fears of higher interest rates, she said. Higher rates make Reits less attractive as instruments from which investors can earn a yield.\n\nOnly six stocks in the top 50 eked out positive total returns. They were shipbuilder Yangzijiang, conglomerate Fraser and Neave, utilities and offshore engineering conglomerate Semb- corp Industries, palm oil producer First Resources, telco M1 and aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul company SIA Engineering.\n\nA shipping downturn and fears of cashflow pressures induced by a credit squeeze in China battered Yangzijiang last June. But the counter went on to recover on optimism that orders would rise. In the sample, the stock is the top performer since tapering fears began, up 27 per cent as at Feb 3.\n\n\"We continue to like Yangzijiang as the best proxy to the shipping and shipbuilding recovery,\" said DBS Group Research in a note last November.\n\nTerence Wong, DMG & Partners head of research, said he favoured oil-and- gas and plantation players, and would wait for an opportunity to get into property stocks.\n\n\"Property - I think we need to let it cool a little first. I don't think the time is now. We're still at the beginning stages of prices coming off,\" he said.\n\n\"But going ahead, policy risk is reduced. Previously, even though the physical property market was doing well, investors weren't snapping up property counters because they were worried about Round Nine, Round 10 of cooling measures. But now, the government has wielded the big stick of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR).\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That excluded a $56.9 million exceptional loss from continuing operations in the year-ago period.\n\nIncluding discontinued operations, fair value adjustments and exceptionals, the latest quarter would have shown a profit of $156.8 million, down from $4.9 billion a year ago, when F&N recognised gains from its divestment of Asia Pacific Breweries.\n\nF&N's beverage and dairy businesses both showed growth in the quarter. Beverage net profit grew 27 per cent to $18.3 million while dairy earnings rose 9.7 per cent to $7.9 million.\n\nThe South-east Asian Games in Myanmar gave a boost to that business segment. Soft drinks, which benefited from 100Plus sponsorship of the games, saw profit before interest and tax grow 36 per cent. Pre-tax profit of breweries, which mostly constitutes the 55 per cent-owned Myan-mar Brewery business, rose 23 per cent.\n\nPrinting and publishing pre-tax profit, however, fell 27 per cent to $1.9 million as textbook sales declined.\n\nF&N said it expected raw material prices to be volatile, with dairy-based materials remaining particularly pricey. The printing and publishing business continues to face challenging conditions, while the strong Singapore dollar relative to regional currencies could create conversion pressure for F&N.\n\nIts shares closed at $3.36 yesterday, down 0.3 per cent or one cent before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/raising-alarm-suspicious-trading", "site_title": "Raising the alarm on suspicious trading", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRaising the alarm on suspicious trading\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 11, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S probably not that widely known, but stockbrokers and trading representatives (TRs) are obliged under current Singapore Exchange (SGX) rules not only to refrain from indulging in suspicious trades but also to report such trades to the authorities. Given that there have often been calls for regulators to do more to stamp out market manipulation and rigging, it is necessary to remind the broking community of this duty.\n\nUnder SGX's Rulebook's Practice Note 13.8.1, TRs are urged not to engage in trades which would amount to creating a false market. Although the rule allows for legitimate trading strategies based on genuine forces of demand and supply, it also states that TRs should not blindly execute trades on behalf of clients which might be construed as suspicious.\n\nThere is guidance on what might be construed as suspicious: whether the trade would result in a material change in price; whether it is unusual for that client, given his or her investment profile (which, of course, means that TRs have to know their clients well); and whether the order is placed far beyond the prevailing bid-ask spread.\n\nPractice Note 13.8.9 goes further: it requires broking houses to have in place compliance processes to study suspicious trades, keep a record, report them to SGX, and warn the TRs concerned. From the point of view of those interested in tackling market manipulation and the ramping up of penny stocks, this rule classifies as suspicious those trades in which there is no beneficial change in ownership but are aimed at creating the impression of active trading.\n\nThese rules make perfect sense as a major constraint regulators face in policing capital markets is the sheer volume of transactions involved. When the market is \"hot\" and trading is frenetic, for example, it is virtually impossible to detect all wrongdoing, regardless of how vigilant and robust the surveillance system might be. Also, as systems evolve and become more sophisticated, so too do the strategies employed by manipulators and insider traders, making regulation a difficult task.\n\nIf we accept that all stakeholders from listed companies to the exchange operator to the small retail investor have a common interest in ensuring a robust, transparent and well-governed stock market, then it is only reasonable to ask which stakeholder is best positioned to assist regulators in keeping an eye on the market. The logical answer is, of course, stockbrokers - since these are the participants who have their eyes peeled on the market all the time and are therefore in the best position to assist the authorities in stamping out insider trading, rigging and other forms of market manipulation.\n\nRecently, Australia formalised a Suspicious Activity Reporting law that broadly follows the rules described earlier but is more detailed. It states that the regulator - the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) - should be notified if the market participant \"has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has placed an order or entered into a transaction while in possession of inside information, or which has the effect of creating or maintaining an artificial price or a false or misleading appearance in the market\".\n\nThere is no duty to conduct a detailed analysis to see if the matter contravenes any specific rules. Rather, if the broker - in the course of business and complying with existing obligations - becomes aware of a transaction that may be suspicious, the regulator has to be notified.\n\nIn its Regulatory Guide 238 dated August 2013, ASIC gives detailed examples of transactions which might be reportable. These would include transactions which make no economic sense, reap unusually high profits in a short space of time, are unnaturally large, and do not fit in with the known investment behaviour of profiles.\n\nOther examples include financial commitments which go beyond a client's means, orders that are placed urgently with no regard to price, front-running, and orders which are placed outside the normal bid-ask spread.\n\nInsider trading is also targeted. If the client is a company official and trades ahead of a price-sensitive announcement by that company and if the broker knows of that official's position as an insider, then this would necessitate official notification. It appears that Australia takes a dim view of insider trading. Since 2009, ASIC has prosecuted 32 insider trading cases. Of these, 23 have been successful.\n\nAlso, in the first month of the suspicious activity reporting law coming into force, ASIC received 17 notifications, though it is not known how many have led to full-scale investigations or action.\n\nThe point to note is that brokers are a valuable source of market intelligence and can play a pivotal role in corporate governance. In view of the current heightened scrutiny of penny stock trading, it might be a good idea for the authorities to remind brokers of their responsibilities.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nobel laureate Robert J Shiller warned as far back as January 2012 that Sweden's property market was in the grip of a bubble, while Paul Krugman, also a Nobel winner, last month said authorities should be worried about the risks.\n\nThe government is responding by imposing the strictest capital standards in Europe. Finance Minister Anders Borg last week said he would target even more onerous requirements, calling the largest banks irresponsible for paying out dividends equal to 66 per cent of profits, on average.\n\nThe government is attacking the wrong end and should boost the impetus to build homes to ease pressure on the housing market, Mr Wolf said. It can deregulate the rental market to boost construction and encourage amortization and change rules that allow borrowers to deduct interest costs from taxes to ease debt loads, he said.\n\nSweden has a shortage of about 150,000 homes which would cost about 400 billion kronor (S$78.3 billion) to build, according to Bengt Hansson, a researcher at the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. About 80 per cent of the shortage is in Stockholm, he said.\n\n\"We have a very strong Swedish banking system so if we can get in place new housing construction the banks would be able to provide financing for that,\" he said. \"That's healthier than the current situation where a lack of supply produces strong demand and increases prices for all of the wrong reasons.\"\n\nApartment prices, which have more than doubled since 2000, rose an annual 11 per cent through December, Svensk Maeklarstatistik said last month. House prices were 5 per cent higher over the past year. As housing prices have soared, consumers have amassed record debt burdens and owe creditors almost 180 percent of disposable incomes, a level the government and central bank say can't be allowed to rise after having almost doubled since the mid-1990s.\n\n\"Prices are being driven higher by demand and that supply can't match that so the best way to keep a lid on prices is to build more homes,\" Johan Karlstrom, chief executive officer at Skanska AB, the world's third largest and the Nordic region's biggest builder, said in a phone interview last Friday. \"Sweden is building only half the number of homes per capita as in Norway and Finland and it's been like that for many years.\"\n\nWhile the government is now looking at ways to shorten the time it takes to build new homes, it has so far stopped short of abandoning rent controls.\n\nFinance Minister Anders Borg lst Thursday said he was surprised by rising dividend payouts as he plans to raise the risk-weights banks must apply to mortgages to 25 per cent after tripling them to 15 per cent last year.\n\nThe government is seeking to protect a recovery in the largest Nordic economy, which has been led by consumers as exporters have struggled with slack demand. The government estimated in December that the economy will expand 2.4 per cent this year, after growing one per cent last year.\n\nPlans to add a so-called countercyclical buffer that will change with the credit cycle on top of existing capital requirements also won't address the stresses, he said. The government will this spring present a road map for future capital requirements on Nordea Bank AB, Swedbank AB, Svenska Handelsbanken AB and SEB AB. The four have combined assets worth about four times Sweden's gross domestic product.\n\nWhile Swedbank welcomed raising risk-weights to 15 per cent, increasing them further won't have the desired effect because it will probably curb construction instead of cooling house prices and debt growth, Mr Wolf said.\n\nAccording to Mr Wolf, raising mortgage risk-weights to 25 per cent will only increase the cost of a mortgage by about 0.30 percentage point.\n\n\"It's another way to cool things down a bit, but it's like giving aspirin to someone who's broken their leg when you instead should put a cast on it,\" he said. The increase will hit consumption first and have \"secondary effects\" on businesses \"so that's where the credit losses will happen.\"\n\nSkanska's Mr Karlstrom said rules for building permits and standards need to be eased to cut the time it takes to develop a property from today's six to seven years.\n\nThese rules are more complicated in Sweden than elsewhere, he said. \"If we expand infrastructure in Stockholm we will be able to find more places to build homes\" needed to accommodate the two busloads of people that move in to the Stockholm region every day, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

All three regions marked gains, with rental prices climbing 3.6 per cent in the RCR, 0.4 per cent in CCR and 0.2 per cent in the OCR.\n\nRental volume of 2,348 contracts in January was 8.1 per cent higher than in December; it was, however, a 14.1 per cent contraction from January last year.\n\nERA's Mr Lim said: \"It is now a tenant's market; properties nearer MRT stations will probably see rents holding up. In addition, new apartments are preferred over older ones.\"\n\nHe predicts that overall private property prices will come under pressure from new completions and ease further by between 6 per cent and 10 per cent this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But taxing aviation at levels equal to the sin taxes applied to alcohol and tobacco makes no sense.\"\n\nAirlines globally will post a record US$19.7 billion in combined net income in 2014 as a wave of consolidation and streamlining prompted by the global slump helps rein in capacity and supports prices, Geneva-based Iata said in December.\n\nPassenger numbers topped three billion for the first time last year, according to the industry group.\n\nCountries such as Singapore and China are expanding their airports ahead of demand, while there are others not investing fast enough to meet the growing number of air travellers.\n\nBoeing Co and Airbus Group NV, the world's two biggest planemakers, count on Asian airlines to buy more aircraft in the next two decades as economic growth in the region enables more people to take flights.\n\nWhile Mumbai opened a new terminal last month, it still faces constraints, Mr Tyler said. Jakarta and Manila also have similar problems, he said.\n\nAir travel is considered a luxury in developing economies, hence India levies high fuel taxes and across Africa there's a proliferation of facility fees.\n\nIndia, the world's second-most populous nation, needs about US$12.2 billion of investments in airport infrastructure in the five years to 2017, according to the Planning Commission, a government body that formulates five-year economic and social programmes. The number of passengers may surge more than 50 per cent to 370 million in that period, it said.\n\nIn Indonesia, most major airfields were operating at double or triple their capacity in 2011, according to the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative, a project funded by the Australian government.\n\nTo accommodate growth, Indonesia's government is spending about US$53 billion to improve transport infrastructure including airports, ports and railways.\n\nEurope is also struggling with infrastructure issues as airports aren't expanding fast enough, Mr Tyler said. By 2030, as much as 12 per cent of demand could be lost, he said.\n\nEfforts to bring Europe under a single skies pact, which could bring about five billion euros (S$8.7 billion) of efficiencies to the economies, have been mired in a web of governments' vested interests, Mr Tyler said.\n\nIata, with members including Singapore Airlines Ltd and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, is upgrading operational safety audits on airlines, Mr Tyler said. There were fewer than 300 aviation fatalities last year, while airlines moved about 3.6 billion people.\n\nRoute distribution among airlines, carried out in the form of landing rights and service approvals negotiated country-by- country, should be reformed to reflect the current level of air travel, Mr Tyler said.\n\n\"Totally archaic rules and regulations, which probably have good historical reasons, still apply to modern-day aviation,\" he said. \"Could you imagine governments dividing markets in other industries in the same way as they grant international traffic rights?\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced that they plan to introduce a minimum trading price, possibly within a range of 10 to 20 cents, for mainboard listings.\n\nThe proposed rule comes as companies that apply to list on the mainboard have to be listed at at least 50 cents per share, with the two regulators estimating that this could affect 130 to 230 listed firms.\n\nWhile mainboard companies that do not meet the proposed requirement face delisting, they can easily retain their listed status by undergoing a share consolidation, a banker told BT.\n\nAlso, companies with shares that trade below the final minimum share price may have up to 36 months to comply.\n\nThe proposed minimum trading price is in line with regulations in the US markets, where a minimum bid price of US$1 is required.\n\nCompanies listed in the US tend to undergo a share consolidation to meet such requirements, or to increase participation from institutional investors, who typically shy away from low-price stocks.\n\nIn a share consolidation, a company reduces the number of its outstanding shares, and in doing so, boosts the share price.\n\nSociety of Remisiers president Jimmy Ho pointed out that companies with shares that do not meet the minimum trading price can also transfer the shares to an alternative trading platform.\n\n\"My view is that the companies, if they end up being on Catalist, the general public will still be keen as long as there's a platform to continue trading,\" he said.\n\nThis move could lift the average trading value of the market - albeit artificially through the use of share consolidation, a senior broker told BT. He noted that the average trading value of the Singapore market since late-2012 has fallen to under 50 cents - way below its 10-year average.\n\nThis has also shown how \"the focus on penny stocks has changed the market structure,\" he added.\n\nIn their consultation paper, SGX and MAS noted that this proposed change fits with an earlier proposal to cut the standard lot size from 1,000 to 100 units.\n\nThey noted that this, while benefitting retail investors, could also exacerbate the risks of high volatility with low-price securities.\n\nThere is higher risk in penny stock trading, since a small fall in the share price of a penny stock in absolute terms translates to a high percentage of loss.\n\n\"This, in turn, makes low price securities more susceptible to excessive speculation and potential market manipulation,\" the two regulators noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will open later this year, and is expected to host a slew of international events, starting with the 2014 Asean Summit in May.\n\nIn Australia, Parkroyal Melbourne, a waterfront development spanning the first 18 storeys of The Altus, a 37-storey hotel and apartment complex located in the Digital Harbour Precinct of Melbourne Docklands, will open in 2016.

That scheme had incited staunch opposition from countries such as China and had nearly sparked a trade war.\n\nUnder the new scheme, the emissions tax would be payable only by airlines with flights in European airspace as opposed to the last point of departure, although there are certain exemptions for developing countries that meet specific criteria. The EU's Commission, Parliament and the European Council must all be in agreement on the rules of the regional ETS scheme by the April deadline this year.\n\nBut Mr Baldwin stressed that the process should not affect Icao's efforts and that Europe will align to whatever is agreed upon in 2016.\n\nIn his speech earlier, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, Tony Tyler, highlighted that it was \"unfortunate\" Europe was trying to impose its regional ETS, especially as governments \"need to be working together and concentrating their efforts\" to deliver a global MBM by the 2016 Assembly.\n\nWhile the panellists were divided on some aspects, they broadly agreed that the clock was ticking and there was plenty to do by then.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By reducing the risk of market manipulation, the proposed changes will promote confidence and prudence in investing.\"\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore Exchange (SGX) are seeking public feedback on a wide-ranging set of possible rule changes. Among these are proposals aimed at contra trading, a uniquely Singapore and Malaysia practice of taking a position and then reversing it before the settlement period ends without having to put up collateral.\n\nThe proposed changes will require brokers to collect 5 per cent of a customer's open position as collateral. The settlement period will also be shortened, by a day, to two days.\n\nJimmy Ho, president of the Singapore Society of Remisiers, said there were generally two camps on the issue. The first was that contra trading, which accounted for about 31 per cent of turnover from October 2012 to October 2013, provided crucial liquidity to the market.\n\nThe other camp feels that contra trading is a source of systemic risk.\n\n\"Personally, I think this 5 per cent collateral is a good compromise,\" Mr Ho said. \"In the sense that it gives a bit of security to the houses and the remisiers and lowers the risk, but at the same time it doesn't hit on contra entirely.\"\n\nMr Ho felt that a T+2 settlement period was appropriate, but the measures should not be tightened further such that all speculative activity is stamped out.\n\n\"The stockbroking industry has to have both sides, speculative and investing. We need both. We shouldn't compromise too much against the first one.\"\n\nDMG & Partners head of research Terence Wong reckoned that the contra proposals were positive overall, and though the collateral requirements would ultimately protect remisiers, that profession will probably take a hit on the turnover front.\n\n\"Market conditions are not helping,\" Mr Wong said. \"It's been very quiet for some time... In the greater scheme of things, they (remisiers) will feel the impact because the investors will gamble less.\"\n\nJust how much market activity will change remains the big, unanswered question.\n\nCIMB analysts Kenneth Ng and Jessalynn Chen estimated that overall, the measures proposed by MAS and SGX would not crimp SGX's revenue as long as retail trading activity does not fall by more than 15 per cent.\n\nThat sensitivity assumes that the long-term average split of institutional and retail activity is divided evenly.\n\nMr Ng told The Business Times that numbers aside, the proposals should improve the quality of the market.\n\n\"What SGX is telling you is, look, I don't want this segment of retail to be playing this punting with little or no fundamentals,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nCarol Fong, chief executive of CIMB Securities, noted that lower clearing fees that SGX will be implementing could help to offset some of the dampening effect of the proposed contra rules.\n\n\"For investors, 5 per cent outlay is not too much to ask,\" she said.\n\nOne senior executive at a local broking house, who declined to be named, said the changes could push investors towards margin or leveraged products, such as warrants or contracts for differences.\n\n\"Now if everybody has to place 5 per cent, that's 20 times leverage,\" the executive said. \"If there's a stock and its share price is too high, I can get something else that gives me more than 20 times leverage instead.\"\n\nThe executive thought that one possible alternative to collecting collateral could be brokers charging higher fees.\n\n\"You can go back to the old days where it's unsecured, but we charge pretty high premiums.\"\n\nCIMB's Ms Fong reckoned that the market will ultimately adapt to the new changes, noting that every other market in the world except for Singapore and Malaysia work on a collateral system.\n\n\"The regulators could have taken a very strong stance and said, all cash upfront trading,\" she said. \"This tries to strike a balance.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We're comfortable with the backlog that we have, the customer sets that we have,\" said John Wojick, senior vice-president of global sales (commercial) for Boeing, yesterday.\n\n\"An awful lot of demand is replacement of existing fleets that are not as efficient as the ones we're producing today,\" he said, adding that upcoming planes such as the single-aisle 737 MAX and the 777X will be even more efficient. With fuel prices remaining high by historical standards, airlines are placing orders for next-generation aircraft - which burn less fuel - farther out than before.\n\nEven with emerging economies such as India and Indonesia - where domestic carriers have been building up their fleet - struggling with depreciation in their currencies, this is not expected to translate to order cancellations. \"It's something that we watch,\" he said, but added that it is not seeing \"a whole lot of impact\" at present.\n\nLast year, Boeing delivered a record 648 planes. This is expected to hit 715-725 aircraft this year, with a significant number coming from Asia. It has an order backlog of about 5,080 planes, stretching up to 2022 and beyond.\n\nBoeing anticipates that demand from Asia will constitute almost half of worldwide demand over the next two decades. It is also in talks with customers of the long-range 777 aircraft, as it seeks to fill orders for the new variant, the 777X.\n\nAmong the potential buyers for the 777X is Singapore Airlines, which is said to be considering up to 40 planes - either the 777X or Airbus' new wide-body A350 - as it tries to phase out the existing 777 planes. The 777-9X variant, with some 400 seats, is expected to come onstream in 2020.\n\n\"(SIA's) been a tremendous customer on the 777 and we're obviously going to work hard to make sure they continue with the 777X,\" said Mr Wojick. \"We spend an awful lot of time talking to Singapore about the 777X.\"\n\nThe 777-X was launched at the Dubai Airshow in November, securing huge orders from Emirates and Etihad. Other customers include Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific.\n\nAt the same time, the US-based planemaker is also considering its next step, which could include a midrange plane. Mr Wojick said there \"could be a market\" for a 200-300 seater plane with a smaller range than its Dreamliner.\n\nIt is in talks with customers to get a sense of their interest and requirements, especially in Asia where a range of 6,500 to 8,000 km would work well, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing is working \"diligently\" to rectify issues with its 787 Dreamliner, which recently made the news after an Air India flight bound for New Delhi had to be diverted to Kuala Lumpur due to a software glitch.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Should the public offer and placement be oversubscribed, CapitaMall Trust Management Ltd, as manager of CMT, may increase the total issue size to up to $350 million and determine the final allocation between the public offer and placement, CMT said.\n\nSubscriptions under the public offer will also be subject to balloting if the total subscriptions exceed the amount available.\n\nThe minimum investment amount is $2,000 for subscriptions under the public offer, with incremental multiples of $1,000. The public offer opens for subscription at 9am today and will close at 12 noon on Feb 18.\n\nAlong with the 2011 launch of its retail bond programme, CMT had issued its first series of two-year retail bonds at a fixed coupon rate of 2 per cent. The offer was about 1.9 times oversubscribed and had to be increased from $200 million to $300 million to meet what CMT said was \"strong demand from both public and institutional investors\". The bonds have since been fully repaid last year.\n\nLast month, CMT posted a 15.3 per cent year-on-year increase in distribution per unit to 2.72 cents for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013.\n\nIts shares ended one cent lower at $1.815 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The \"vertical retail floors\" are being sold with one strata title per floor - of 4,718 sq ft gross floor area.\n\nSome 120 cheques were received when submissions of interest closed last Friday for the initial 10 floors, which are on Levels 10-20 (there is no 14th floor in the building as the number is considered inauspicious in Cantonese). Savills (Hong Kong) is the coordinating agent for the sale.\n\nA lottery system was used to select the 10 buyers, who were notified over the weekend and signed the sales and purchase agreement yesterday. The prices achieved range from HK$28,100 - HK$31,000 (S$4,600 - S$5,080) per square foot after discount. The average price achieved for the initial 10 floors is slightly above HK$29,000 psf.\n\nDue to strong demand, the vendors released another four floors, of which two were sold, at 5 per cent higher prices. Level 22 fetched about HK$30,585 psf and Level 26, HK$30,953 psf.\n\nLast month, the CLSA- Roxy tie-up completed the purchase of Levels 6-13, 15-23 and 26-29 at 8 Russell Street for HK$1.8 billion. This reflects close to HK$18,200 psf based on the total gross floor area of nearly 99,080 sq ft\n\nAssuming CLSA and Roxy achieve an average price of about HK$30,000 psf for their 21 floors, their profit from the venture could be around HK$1.1 billion, based on a back-of- the-envelope calculation. For its 30 per cent share in the venture, Roxy stands to book a profit of close to HK$350 million.\n\nCurrently, the space is occupied by Shama Serviced Apartments, which is expected to cease operations in the building as the CLSA-Roxy partnership is selling the strata floors based on vacant possession.\n\nThe 29-storey building is on a site with 999-year leasehold tenure starting June 1861.\n\nLocated opposite Times Square, Russell Street is one of the world's most sought-after retail streets.\n\nEmperor group owns the lower floors of 8 Russell Street. Last year, McDonald's moved out of its prime street-level spot in the building, making way for cosmetics chain Sasa, which agreed to pay HK$1.58 million a month rent for the 6,000 sq ft space. This is more than three times the HK$500,000 monthly rent McDonald's used to pay under its lease signed two years earlier, according to a South China Morning Post report in June last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The FTSE ST Mid Cap index slipped a tad, by 0.04 per cent, while the FTSE ST Small Cap index eased 0.3 per cent on the day.\n\nRegulators had been concerned that the measures, announced late last Friday, could trigger a repeat of Hong Kong in 2002, when a consultation paper on setting a minimum share price there triggered a massive selloff in penny stocks.\n\n\"They were worried it would turn out like Hong Kong,\" said DMG & Partners head of research Terence Wong. \"About 10 years ago they released this Big Bang, or Mini Bang, in Hong Kong. The way I look at it, the reaction shouldn't be that large now. If you look at all the various measures, it's not really harsh.\"\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore Exchange (SGX) are seeking public feedback on a number of proposals aimed at improving orderly trading, transparency and listings in the securities markets.\n\nAmong the key suggestions are measures to end the practice of uncollateralised speculative trading commonly called contra; to impose minimum share prices for mainboard companies; and to create independent bodies that will have a say in new listings and disciplinary matters.\n\nAlso for public consultation are possible rules to broaden the disclosure requirements for short positions and to require disclosure of brokers' trading restrictions.\n\nIt helped that Singapore investors could be more receptive to stricter regulation compared to Hong Kong in 2002, given that markets here are still smarting from last October's penny stock selloff - an event that triggered the review leading to the latest consultation. Whatever reservations there are about short- term pains, there was a sense that the market would eventually adjust.\n\n\"It's just like the property cooling measures,\" Mr Wong said. \"Over time, people will just get used to it - like it's a way of life.\"\n\nThe contra trading proposals were expected to have an impact on overall trading activity in the short term, given that contra accounted for 31 per cent of turnover in the year to October 2013.\n\nBut other changes, such as reduced clearing fees, were seen as possibly cushioning the blow, leaving the actual impact a question that is very much in the air.\n\nNevertheless, Carol Fong, chief executive of CIMB Securities, described the proposals targeting contra trading as \"measured\".\n\n\"This tries to strike a balance,\" she said.\n\nThe proposal to impose a minimum share price for Mainboard companies also garnered generally positive reviews with expectations of muted market impact.\n\n\"The market's focus on penny stocks has changed the market structure in terms of average trade value per share, which has fallen below the 10-year band from 2001,\" said a senior broker. \"The consultation paper, if implemented, should hopefully see a reversal to the 50-cent to $1.50 band. This, in turn, may help leveraged products pick up.\"\n\nIndustry observers also expected the creation of an independent listing advisory committee to lead to better initial public offerings (IPOs) in Singapore, citing the experience of other markets such as Hong Kong and Toronto.\n\n\"The intent behind the proposed changes, including having a committee with industry and expert representation, is to further strengthen the listings framework and ensure better investor confidence,\" said OCBC's head of group investment banking Gan Kok Kim.\n\n\"To this end, we believe that the measures will help raise the quality of new listings here with the Singapore market continuing to appeal to issuers that are promising and sound.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not surprisingly, it caused quite a stir among market participants.\n\nThere have been murmurs of approval on how the proposals are a much-needed step in the right direction, whispers of concern from brokerages who worry about their impact on liquidity, and grumbles from those who feel these measures are long overdue.\n\nWhile the regulatory proposals contained in the consultation paper are informed and necessary, many of them should have been implemented earlier.\n\nIn particular, BT has argued for years that vesting the regulatory oversight function in SGX, which is also a publicly listed business accountable to its shareholders, does not make for optimum functioning of the market.\n\nThe latest consultation paper appears to affirm this view.\n\nBT believes that SGX's dual roles are in conflict with each other - it is questionable how SGX could conceivably expect to remain an effective regulator when it is also concerned with its growth.\n\nFor a market to be well-run, SGX needs to be an effective regulator with teeth - or at the very least, give the impression that it is one. This is especially so in times of crisis, when the incidence of corporate scandals and failures increases, making for a riskier marketplace and a more challenging regulatory environment.\n\nFor its part, SGX has its business needs to take care of, needs, which are increasingly difficult to meet in a more competitive global environment. Stock exchanges around the world are stepping up their game significantly, coming up with alternative markets to capture more clients, growing larger by taking over rival exchanges and constantly innovating by releasing numerous innovative trading products.\n\nDespite its efforts, SGX has never been able to fully fight off the perception that its effectiveness as a frontline regulator is hampered by its profit-driven motives, or that its ability to grow as a global business is impeded by regulatory concerns.\n\nBT reckons that MAS - which is ultimately responsible for the regulatory framework here - ought to set up a separate, independent, well-manned and authoritative body to regulate the market, one that is unencumbered by profit considerations.\n\nIt is a model that has been adopted, with great success, in major markets, such as Australia, the United States and Hong Kong.\n\nFor years, as we understood it, MAS resisted going down that route because it did not feel the need for a separate frontline market regulator.\n\nClearly, things have come to a head in recent times, with the growing number of corporate scandals and market fiascos the regulators have had to deal with - the China Sky Chemical Fibre debacle and last year's penny stock sell-off, to name just two.\n\nIn this latest consultation paper, \"to address perceived and actual conflicts of interests in relation to SGX's role as the listing authority, MAS and SGX propose that an independent Listings Advisory Committee be established to consider listing policy issues and listing applications that meet specified referral criteria\".\n\nThey have also suggested establishing an independent Listings Disciplinary Committee and Listings Appeals Committee, to improve the transparency of SGX's disciplinary process and ensure fair administration of sanctions for listing-related matters. Along with this is the suggestion that the range of regulatory sanctions for listing rule breaches be expanded to include powers to impose fines, restrict the activities that issuers may undertake, as well as make offers of compositions for minor and technical breaches.\n\nWhile these committees are not on the same level as an entity such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), as this paper hopes for, they are a grudging move in the right direction.\n\nThe next important step, which will come much later, will be to ensure that these committees - paling in comparison to the SEC and ASIC though they may be - are effective.\n\nThe right people need to be chosen for these committees. They need to be folks who do not just understand the workings of the market, but also represent a wide range of interests. For example, MAS and SGX intend for the Listings Advisory Committee to \"introduce practitioner experience to the decision-making process\", but it is also important that the committee include investor representatives, to ensure that those interests are safeguarded.\n\nAs for the Listings Disciplinary Committee and Listings Appeals Committee, it is important to ensure that they are able to carry out their duties effectively and that overall market enforcement is not compromised.\n\nOne concern is that if it does not cost much to appeal against a disciplinary action, it may become a matter of course for every disciplined entity to lodge an appeal. This could drag out the entire enforcement process and make it difficult/tedious/costly - and maybe even, eventually, pointless - to discipline an entity.\n\nSuch concerns should be considered at the relevant time to ensure that the committees and the new sanctions hit their mark.\n\nThat would perhaps, then, pave the way for the eventual setting up of a full-fledged independent regulator that BT believes is necessary for the effective regulation of the marketplace and the realisation of the true business potential of SGX.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The findings are based on payments made by more than 120,000 corporations and small and medium enterprises in Singapore each quarter.\n\nConstruction companies are now the second fastest payers in Singapore, it said. The fastest payers, chemical companies, have historically had payment cycles twice as fast as any other industry and currently take 16 days to pay a debt, three days more than it did in Q3.\n\nOng Siew Kim, senior general manager of DP Information Group, said that better payment behaviour by construction companies was a sign that the industry had enjoyed a strong period of growth.\n\n\"The construction industry has been buoyed by numerous government projects, which has pumped cash into the bank accounts of many firms, leading to increasingly fast debt repayments.\n\n\"However, with an expected slowdown in public projects, payment speeds could begin to slow again.\n\n\"Companies that do business with construction firms need to be wary of the impact of a slowdown and the chances that some companies could get into trouble. The best way to protect themselves from bad debt is to join a credit bureau where payment data is shared among members.\"\n\nThe national average for days-turned-cash (DTC) - a tool for measuring the number of days a company takes to pay its creditor once the debt is due - remained unchanged at 39 days in Q4.\n\nThis is the third quarter where the DTC has remained unchanged at 39. A DTC of below 40 indicates that payment speeds within the economy are relatively fast, leading to better cashflow for companies.\n\nHealthcare/medical companies saw the largest blowout in payment times, with debt payments slowing by 14 days to 41 days in Q4.\n\n\"Companies within the sector acknowledge the slowdown, but feel it reflects the current trading conditions in the industry, where there is strengthening demand on new sales and less focus paid to payment speed,\" the bureau said.\n\nThe heathcare/medical sector has been showing positive performance over the last few years. Domestically, the silver population has increased demand for healthcare and health-related services and products. Increasing affluence around Asia has also fuelled the demand for healthcare and equipment suppliers, it said.\n\nThe manufacturing sector experienced the second largest deterioration in payment speeds with a nine-day slowdown. Companies in the industry explained that if work is being done on a contract basis and the main contractor is slow in payment, then it affects sub-contractors further down the payment chain.\n\nUtilities/fuels are the slowest paymaster, taking 92 days to settle, unchanged from Q3.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, 10 of the world's 30 busiest airports were from the Asia-Pacific in 2011, up from just five airports in 2000.\n\nBesides liberalising air policies, other key ways that governments would have to respond to the heavier traffic and rising number of flights would be to ensure their airports and air navigation systems can cope with growing air traffic, as well as better meeting the needs of air travellers.\n\nIn the afternoon, Mr Lui and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore's director-general, Yap Ong Heng, launched Singapore's new Air Traffic Control Centre. The next-generation air traffic management system, known as the Long Range Radar and Display System (Lorads) III, is expected to help manage a \"significant increase\" in traffic handling capacity.\n\nThales, which won the contract in 2008, developed the $300 million system. Implemented in October last year, Lorads III serves two main operations centres, the approach centre and the area centre.\n\nThe new system is equipped with advanced technologies which allow more aircraft to fly within the same volume of airspace safely.\n\nFor instance, Lorads III can process and display 2,000 system tracks at a time, with each track representing the position of an aircraft. This is nearly seven times higher than the number of system tracks that could be displayed by the previous system, Lorads II. And at 2,000 flight plans, Lorads III can also handle four times more flights plans, which is the information associated with an aircraft, compared to Lorads II.\n\nLast year, Singapore handled some 600,000 aircraft movements.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding the loss, net profit would have been $3.8 million.\n\nRevenue more than doubled to $75.1 million from $36.6 million a year ago, due mainly to Neptune.\n\nAustralia-based Neptune and its subsidiaries provide engineering services to offshore oil and gas, marine and renewable-energy industries, which MTQ said were complementary to its focus on subsea engineering. An MTQ subsidiary's offer for it was completed last April.\n\nChief executive officer Kuah Boon Wee said in a statement yesterday that the acquisition of Neptune has enabled MTQ to report a strong set of results. \"Acquisition-related growth will taper off in the historical comparisons from next quarter. However, we remain focused on improving results through cross selling, increasing efficiency and streamlining our cost base further.\"\n\nIn Bahrain, where the company is expanding operations, enquiries remain encouraging, he said.\n\nGross profit margin for the quarter fell to 33.8 per cent, from a restated 38.5 per cent last year, due to the inclusion of Neptune. Staff costs increased by 122 per cent from $5 million to $11.1 million.\n\nFor the nine-month period, revenue more than doubled to $234.4 million from $115.1 million a year ago, while net profit also more than doubled to $18.4 million from $8.7 million.\n\nEarnings per share came to 5.08 cents for the quarter, and 14.63 cents for the nine-month period ended Dec 31, 2013.\n\nNet asset value per share was 99 cents at end-2013.\n\nLast month, the company said that it would acquire Binder Group, an Australian company that specialises in pipe supports for the oil and gas industry.\n\nBloomberg said that DMG & Partners Research, the only broker that covers the firm, called the move an \"attractively priced purchase\". It raised its target price for the stock to $2.67.\n\n\"We continue to like MTQ's high cash generation, strong earnings growth, low valuations, healthy yields, strong industry backdrop and low gearing,\" it said.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, MTQ closed at $1.555, up 1.5 cents, or one per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Against the backdrop of a push by the Obama administration to shift or \"pivot\" the locus of its geostrategy to East Asia, Ms Rice stressed that there was \"a whole world out there, and we've got interests and opportunities in that whole world\".\n\nBut as Secretary of State John Kerry prepares for another round of shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, where he is trying to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations (after attending the recent international summit on ending the civil war in Syria that followed more talks on resolving the Iran nuclear crisis), it now seems that the administration's policy in the Middle East is anything but \"modest\". In fact, one official told the Wall Street Journal recently that Washington was seeking \"to dispel\" the myth of disengagement, particularly the notion that the US \"is pulling back from the Middle East\".\n\nNo one was suggesting that the Obama administration should pull back from the Middle East or begin a process of disengagement from the region. The United States continues to maintain core security interests in that region, including the protection of access to its energy resources and the strategic partnership with allies like Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt. It's understandable therefore that curbing Iran's nuclear programme and ending the civil war in Syria would remain top US priorities. But for an American administration committed to elevating East Asia to the top of its foreign policy agenda and intent on not being \"consumed 24/7\" by the Middle East, it makes very little sense to spend so much time and diplomatic capital in dealing with the latest dispute over the establishment of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank while it's the danger of a military conflict between China and Japan that should probably cause President Obama and Secretary Kerry sleepless nights.\n\nMoreover, while the United States should remain engaged in trying to resolve the Iran nuclear crisis, its fixation on the issue may be diverting its attention from the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. And Washington should recognise that the territorial disputes between China and other countries in North and South-east Asia pose as much of a threat to long-term US strategic interests as the struggles between Sunnis and Shiites in West Asia.\n\nUS partners in East Asia wish a lot of success to Secretary Kerry in bringing peace and stability to the Middle East, but they also hope that in the process he will indeed not be consumed 24/7 by one region of the world and start doing some of his shuttle diplomacy in the Pacific Rim area as well.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

An earlier-scheduled Indonesian government meeting with potential investors in Singapore today for its first greenfield refinery development in 30 years has now been cancelled.\n\nIt would have involved the Vice-Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Susilo Siswoutomo and Finance Vice-Minister Mahendra Siregar as well as Pertamina officials, according to the meeting agenda.\n\nNo official reasons for the cancellation of the scheduled \"market consultation event\" at the Shangri-La Hotel were given, but BT understands that it is related to the current diplomatic row between the two countries over the naming of the Indonesian navy ship.\n\nThis latest fallout follows the reported cancellation of invitations to this week's Singapore Airshow for Indonesian navy chief Marsetio and 100 Indonesian armed forces officers. Indonesian Deputy Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin has also decided not to come to Singapore after Second Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing reportedly rescheduled a meeting here originally slated for today.\n\nThe Indonesian greenfield refinery meeting here was aimed at getting potential partners to build, own and operate the facility.\n\nThis is for a planned 300,000-plus barrels per day refinery with potential sites including the Bontang LNG plant in East Kalimantan. Its targeted key products will be petrol and diesel for the domestic Indonesian market.\n\nThe refinery will be \"cutting edge in terms of proposed scale and complexity\", and the project will offer \"100 per cent ownership for investors and full investor input in project design and structure\", the notes for the meeting indicated.\n\n\"It is an opportune time to invest in the Indonesian refining sector,\" the meeting notes added, saying that the country's consumption of refined products grew by an average 4.3 per cent annually in 2001-13, and that no new capacity had been added in recent years.\n\n\"As a result, domestic output currently meets just 70 per cent of domestic consumption, with the rest met through imports.\"\n\nThis is reinforced by a projection by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie that Indonesia's petrol and diesel deficit will persist for the long term and reach 1.16 million bpd by 2038 if no new domestic refining capacity is added.\n\nThe Indonesian government also intends to throw in \"carrots\", including facilitating land acquisition, providing tax concessions and also \"political risk mitigation mechanisms\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Tan said that around US$6 million has been invested so far in the venture, with plans for more to boost routes and frequencies.\n\n\"Airlines in that region are not very strong,\" Ms Tan said. \"Air Caucasus has a huge opportunity to scale up quickly, now that we have a scheduled airline status.\"\n\nShe added that Georgia also had fifth freedom rights to the USA, allowing options for routes there.\n\nThe airline currently has two MD-83s, leased from A-Sonic Aviation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ms Tan's listed company, with a third aircraft due to arrive next month. There are plans to add two more by summer.\n\nThe MD-83s work well for start-up airlines, Ms Tan said, as they offer lower ownership cost.\n\nThe airline is preparing for the start of scheduled service from March, with 12 destinations in seven countries planned. This includes Tel Aviv in Israel, Aktau in Kazakhstan, as well as Moscow and St Petersburg in Russia.\n\nThese \"golden routes\" were unique and seldom explored, she said.\n\nThere are also talks with other airlines for strategic alliance and codeshare opportunities.\n\nMs Tan said that the holding company EuroAsia Airlines was also open to any strategic equity partnerships.\n\n\"The airline's AOC in the region is unique, given the routes to destinations such as Russia and Iran,\" she said. \"It would be a valuable hub for partners.\"\n\nShe added that given the dearth of domestic airlines in Georgia, Air Caucasus also had the potential to become the national air carrier for the country.\n\nMeanwhile, A-Sonic will continue with its business of aircraft leasing and parts supply for now, as operating an airline is not a core business. If Air Caucasus performs well, A-Sonic will consider incorporating it, subject to board and shareholder approval, Ms Tan added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The wooden shack was flattened last February along with the dwellings of thousands of others that authorities said were moved for a housing project that's yet to get off the ground.\n\n\"We can't be living in this kind of condition forever,\" Ms Macully said as she prepared to move back home about 161km east of Lagos. \"We're citizens of Nigeria. Let them have mercy on us.\"\n\nThe demolition is making way for more than 1,000 one-to two-bedroom apartments that will be beyond the means of Nigerians like Ms Macully. Lagos, sub-Saharan Africa's most populated city, is trying to narrow a national housing shortage that the World Bank estimates at 17 million. While Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation with about 170 million residents, the real estate market is hobbled by a dearth of home loans, interest rates about six times those in the US, poverty and the continent's second most expensive property prices.\n\nProperty investors in Africa's largest oil producing nation are aiming to lease the apartments to foreigners and the wealthy of Lagos. In the city of about 21 million people, landlords typically demand one to two years' rent upfront due to the cost of land, the continent's most expensive after Angola's, according to Knight Frank LLP, a London-based property broker.\n\nLagos state governor Babatunde Fashola, whose second term expires after elections next year, is attempting to create a workable city out of one that's currently best known for crime, gridlocked traffic and daily power outages. Lagos is the smallest inland area, yet most densely packed of the West African nation's 36 states. Seventy percent of Lagosians live in slums, according to Amnesty International. The state government says Lagos needs 4 million extra homes to close the gap.\n\nCompanies including Johannesburg-based FirstRand Ltd, Africa's second largest bank, Resilient Property Income Fund and Actis LLP, a London-based private-equity firm, are funding construction of office blocks and shopping malls rather than rushing into residential mortgages, which are offered by some local lenders such as FBN Holdings Plc and Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nThe government last month started Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Co to tackle the deficit. It will fund lenders to help encourage the building of 75,000 homes a year for low- to middle-income earners. The country doesn't publish house-price data, according to Global Property Guide, and real estate transparency is the worst of 97 markets after Sudan, according to a 2012 index published by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.\n\nThe World Bank estimates there were 44,000 mortgages with an average size of five million naira (S$38,643) each from 2004 to 2010. The ratio of home loans to gross domestic product of Africa's second largest economy was 0.6 per cent at the end of 2011, even after the market surged four-fold from 2006. That compares with 31 per cent in South Africa and a European average of 50 per cent, according to the Washington-based lender.\n\nInequality\n\nWhile GDP per capita more than trebled to US$1,725 in the decade through 2013, according to International Monetary Fund estimates, inequality has worsened with 68 per cent of Nigerians living on less than US$1.25 a day, compared with 63 per cent in 2004, World Bank estimates show.\n\nNigeria's oil wealth over the decades has come at the expense and mismanagement of other industries, resulting in a lack of formal jobs with crude revenues being siphoned off by corruption without benefiting the majority of the population. Property scams run rife with buildings often painted with warnings such as \"This House is Not for Sale\" to avoid conmen selling homes to unsuspecting buyers or \"Beware of 419\", referring to the Nigerian fraud code. The nation ranks 144th among 177 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.\n\nEven in Lagos's most affluent districts of Victoria Island and Ikoyi, trash builds up on pavements and in open drainage gutters, while derelict and poorly maintained buildings decay in the tropical heat. Knight Frank estimates office rents in those areas can typically amount to about US$1,000 per square metre each year, while residential rents can cost US$10,000 a month.\"Buildings quickly deteriorate,\" Peter Welborn, head of Africa at Knight Frank, said by phone. \"After five, seven, maximum 10 years a building in Lagos will probably look like a building in Europe that's 20 to 25 years old.\"\n\nLess than 11km from Badia East, a local construction company is pumping sand out from the sea, reclaiming eroded coastline to turn the desolate stretch of land into a section that will resemble Nigeria's equivalent of New York's Fifth Avenue, said David Frame, the managing director of South Energyx Nigeria Ltd, which is leading the development. The district, known as Eko Atlantic, probably will become home to 250,000 residents, while 150,000 will be commuting there every day, Mr Frame said in a December interview. A 15-storey commercial building is set to be the first completed development by March 2015 with the land reclamation and sea wall due in 2017.\n\nResidential and office plots on the first phase of the marina overlooking the ocean will sell at US$2,500 per square metre, while those away from the waterfront will go for US$1,250 to US$1,500, he said. Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, home to retailers Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co, had the world's second-highest retail rent per square foot at US$2,500, behind only Hong Kong's Causeway Bay, according to a November report by global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nThe housing market can expand more than 10-fold in the short term, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month, while the creation of Nigeria Mortgage Refinance will help bring interest rates on mortgages to around 10 per cent.\n\nInterest charges on home loans run 18 per cent to 25 per cent, Michael Chu'di Ejekam, a director at London-based Actis, said in an interview in Lagos. \"The ecosystem for residential investment development still remains relatively broken,\" said Mr Ejekam. \"The lack of affordable mortgages is a major challenge, a major deterrent, a major hindrance to the development of residential properties in this market.\"\n\nThere's little incentive or money for private developers to provide low-cost housing, Knight Frank's Welborn said. \"The cost of the land, the cost of what an average individual expects to have in terms of square footage in a number of rooms, none of it makes commercial sense,\" he said.\n\nPlans by Lagos to develop 5,000 affordable homes is a \"drop in the ocean\" of what is needed and private investors are needed to help end the shortage, Bosun Jeje, the state's housing commissioner, said in a Jan 10 interview.\n\nCompensation\n\nThe state is using a 284.4 million naira loan to compensate 1,933 tenants and 319 landlords affected by the Badia East clean-up, Lagos state attorney-general Ade Ipaye said in an interview on Jan 14. Estimates by Amnesty International that the shanty homes of 9,000 people were destroyed are exaggerated, he said.\n\nThe government must ensure people erect legal structures so it can formalise housing and clamp down on crime to make the city more attractive, he said. \"If we cannot relax because all of the parks are now market places or places where people have put up shanties, then we don't have a city,\" Mr Ipaye said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The seller's interest as landlord under those leases will be assumed by M&C New York (Times Square) as part of the transaction.\n\nThe hotel, built in 1981, is a four-star property with 480 guest rooms. Its most recent audited results show a pre-tax profit of $2.1 million for the 327-day period ending December 2012.\n\nProfit during this period reflects non-repeating cost items and the earnings impact of a significant refurbishment carried out on all guest rooms, public spaces and service areas.\n\nThe extensive renovations commenced in the second half of 2012 and were completed by last November.\n\nThe hotel will be M&C's fourth hotel in Manhattan, the others being One UN New York, Millennium Broadway Hotel New York and Millennium Hilton New York.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the same time, world air travel is expected to grow at about 5 per cent annually.\n\nThis year alone, Boeing is guiding for a delivery of 715-725 aircraft, at least 110 of which will be the 787 Dreamliner. This represents almost a doubling of 2011's delivery of 477 airplanes, Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, pointed out at a media briefing yesterday at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.\n\nTo meet demand, Boeing will continue ramping up production rates, Mr Tinseth said. Currently, its 737 lines build 38 airplanes a month. By the middle of this year, this will be increased to 42 and by 2017, it will be expanded further to 47 airplanes a month.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, the new additions to airliners' fleets will be dominated by single-aisle airplanes, by Boeing's estimates. This will be driven by the presence of new low-cost carriers and demand for intra-Asia travel.\n\nThe company's optimistic view of the next two decades comes on the back of a triumphant 2013. For the first time, more than 3 billion people travelled by air last year, while the sector as a whole sold more than 3,800 new airplanes in gross orders, Mr Tinseth noted.\n\nOn the defence end of things, Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) expects a modest increase in defence spending given the region's projected economic growth rate and the stability of defence budgets, its executives told the press at a separate briefing yesterday. This is enough cause for bullishness given how markets elsewhere might stay flat or even decline.\n\n\"Some of the systems that have been in the region are ageing and they require some form of modernisation, so there's a lot of discussion about how to upgrade or make the case to retire and buy new (assets),\" said Chris Raymond, vice-president of business development and strategy at BDS.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, a lot of attention is being paid to maritime surveillance, according to Jim Armington, East Asia and Pacific vice-president, international business development at BDS.\n\n\"That's driven not only by the rise of the economic activity in the region, but also a lot more surface traffic. And a lot more means that the countries have to monitor and track maritime surface activity,\" he said yesterday.\n\nAsked about interest in Boeing's P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft in Southeast Asia, Mr Raymond said: \"There are two or three countries we are talking to about it. Where it will fit in their priorities will be up to them, but these things take time.\"\n\nAt the same time, another major area of interest for the region lies in the field of air supremacy and airspace sovereignty.\n\n\"You will see more interest in fighter and fighter upgrades. (There is) a lot of capability nowadays in our latest F-15s. We're able to come back and retrofit into existing fleets to greatly enhance the aircraft,\" Mr Armington said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Aircraft that will use those engines include the Airbus A320neo, Embraer E-Jets and the Mitsubishi Regional Jet.\n\nMr Adams said: \"One of the big challenges is that we are actually having to ramp up production to meet those increased volumes.\"\n\nHe said production volume was expected to more than double over the next five years, and the company was working to expand its industrial footprint and supply chain.\n\nPart of this expansion includes a new 180,000 sq ft facility, manufacturing fan blades and turbine disks in Seletar Aerospace Park, scheduled to be ready in 2016. It will be dedicated to producing parts for the PurePower line.\n\nThe new engine promises to have higher fuel efficiency, lower noise and reduced maintenance cost.\n\nThe company also opened a 160,000 sq ft repair and engineering facility in Seletar beside the upcoming manufacturing plant yesterday. Called Pratt & Whitney Component Solutions, it will perform certain repairs for the PW4000 series engines, and house support departments.\n\n\"We love doing business on this island,\" Mr Adams said. \"It has a great workforce, very talented people, very very business friendly environment, and we are very satisfied with the operations and we continue to grow, indicated by this and the facility next door.\"\n\nMr Adams said the company will continue discussing with airline manufacturers about the wide body market, but that was for the long run.\n\nP&W manufactures engines for wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 777 and A330. It also partners General Electric (GE) under the Engine Alliance to provide power for the A380.\n\nWith the latest investments totalling US$110 million in Seletar, P&W has a total of nine businesses in Singapore, with over 2,400 staff here.\n\nMinister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang, who was at yesterday's opening, said: Singapore has been very proud to work closely with P&W for many years, we will continue to support Pratt & Whitney's drive to deliver dependable engines to the rest of the world.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Stocks sank as data showed home purchases tumbled last year to a four-year low and retail sales dropped, while manufacturing growth weakened in China, Singapore's biggest export market.\n\n\"The Singapore sell-off is due in large part to the sputtering domestic economy,\" said David Ross, Maryland, Washington-based managing director of Chevy Chase Trust Co, which oversees about US$15 billion. \"The weakening consumer economy portends weakness in the property segment that could send ripples through the financial system. While not the most likely scenario, the odds of a bursting property bubble are increasing.\"\n\nSingapore shares posted the third-biggest decline among developed markets this year after as much as US$3 trillion was wiped from equities worldwide on concern that the global economic recovery is faltering. The city's regulators said last Friday that they may introduce a minimum price for stocks and impose collaterals and other restrictions for trades after a slump in the shares of three commodity companies erased US$6.9 billion in market value over three days in October.\n\nSingapore companies will struggle to boost profits amid rising wages and weakening demand for property, according to Baring Asset and Samsung Asset Management Co.\n\nHouse prices in Singapore, ranked the most-expensive city to buy a luxury home in Asia after Hong Kong, slid in the fourth quarter for the first time in almost two years, trimming annual gains to the smallest since 2008. Two of the three biggest declines on the Straits Times Index last year were property developers.\n\nCapitaMalls Asia Ltd, the worst-performer on the gauge in 2014, may report this week that 2013 net income dropped 19 per cent, based on the average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profits at Straits Times Index member companies are expected to fall one per cent this year, the data shows.\n\n\"Singapore earnings growth is likely to disappoint this year,\" Alan Richardson, whose Samsung Asean Equity Fund outperformed 96 per cent of peers tracked by Bloomberg during the past 12 months, said by phone from Hong Kong last week. \"The key detractors are falling property prices and slowing economic growth in China. The market has already factored in these issues but a sustained market recovery will be difficult if fundamentals are deteriorating.\"\n\nThe daily value of equities traded in Singapore sank to an average S$1.08 billion this year from S$1.77 billion in the same part of 2014, as risk sentiment deteriorated after a plunge in the shares of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Ltd and LionGold Corp in October.\n\nThe country may set up an independent listing committee and boost enforcement, according to a joint statement from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Singapore Exchange Ltd last Friday, following its market structure review spurred by the stock slump.\n\nThe city-state also plans to shorten the trade settlement period to two days from three by 2016 and impose more transparency for short selling, the central bank and exchange said. They are seeking industry feedback over the next three months.\n\nThe Straits Times Index dropped 4.4 per cent in January, the worst start of the year since 2010 and the first time in four years that it underperformed all South-east Asian markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"This is one of the worst Januarys we've seen,\" said Manoj Chaman Lal, vice-president of corporate broking at CIMB Securities Singapore Pte. \"We never really got out of the October 'crisis'. If I could snap a picture of what the trading room looks like, it's almost like a library.\"\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is pushing companies to produce more with fewer employees as the island confronts an ageing population and voter discontent about foreign workers. Policies ranging from higher levies for overseas labour to tighter limits on non-Singaporeans in some industries, have boosted costs for companies including SIA Engineering Co, which said higher wages helped spur a 9.7 per cent drop in third-quarter profit.\n\n\"Sentiment on Singapore isn't that great,\" Soo Hai Lim, a Hong Kong- based fund manager at Baring Asset, which oversees about US$60 billion. \"The market is drifting lower as there are no visible catalysts. Cost pressures, particularly on wages, for Singapore companies are quite high and that's going to eat into their profits.\" Shares on the Singapore benchmark index traded at 13 times estimated earnings last Wednesday, the lowest since June 2012. The gauge gained 1.8 per cent from then through the end of the week.\n\n\"We see a sell-off in the Singapore market to be short-lived,\" Kum Soek Ching, Singapore-based head of South-east Asia research at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said by email last Tuesday. \"Valuations look quite attractive.\"\n\nWing Tai Holdings Ltd, a developer of luxury homes near the Orchard Road shopping belt, said last month that net income in the three months ended Dec 31 tumbled 45 per cent as demand for new residential projects has been adversely affected by tighter mortgage lending policies at Singapore banks.\n\nDBS Group Holdings Ltd, South-east Asia's biggest lender, is expected to report this week a 4.9 per cent decline in 2013 profit, according to the average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nEquities around the world are declining this year as China's economy slows, emerging-market currencies slump and the Federal Reserve cuts stimulus. The MSCI World Index has lost 2.9 per cent since Dec 31.\n\nIndonesia was the only Asian nation among eight tracked by Bloomberg where foreign investors bought more stocks than they sold this year. Investors dumped US$2.3 billion of South Korean equities and US$1.4 billion of shares in Taiwan, the data shows.\n\n\"The money flow is not coming back to Asia for a while,\" Mark Matthews, Singapore-based head of Asia research for Julius Baer, which oversees about US$377 billion in client assets, said by phone on Monday last week. \"I don't see the bottom for Singapore happening any time soon.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

KH Kea Properties also owns an adjacent 635 sq ft piece of land along Cashin Street. Currently serving as road access to the basement carpark, the plot can yield up to 3,302 sq ft GFA based on its 5.2 plot ratio in Master Plan 2008.\n\nBoth properties have balance lease tenure of 812 years. They are zoned for commercial use. Together they can yield 32,351 sq ft GFA.\n\nLocated a stone's throw from City Hall MRT Station, KH Kea Building is more than 30 years old.\n\nSavills Singapore, which is conducting an expression of interest for the building and adjacent plot, is inviting proposals to participate in a joint venture with the vendor to tap on the highest and best use for the property. \"Any other proposals are welcomed,\" it said.\n\nHowever, the property consultancy could not provide a price guide at this juncture, as the pricing will depend on the proposed terms of the joint venture.\n\nOne possibility would be to do addition and alteration works including utilising the GFA from the adjacent plot to add a floor to KH Kea Building or bulking up its retail podium. Strata commercial units could then be sold. Alternative uses such as a hotel, serviced residence or residential may be possible - subject to approval from the authorities. Another option would be to tear down the existing building and redevelop the combined site.\n\nKH Kea Building has F&B space on the first two levels (with close to 5,000 sq ft net lettable area) and seven office floors above of 2,500 sq ft each.\n\n\"The vendor had received unsolicited interest in recent months, which is why an EOI exercise is being initiated,\" said Savills deputy managing director Steven Ming. \"The offering of CBD boutique commercial assets with long 999-year leasehold tenure situated at prime location near an MRT interchange station is rare.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/advantages-small-caps", "site_title": "The advantages of small caps", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe advantages of small caps\n\nSmall-cap stocks offer more opportunities than ever before, argue ALEC HARPER, MATHIEU L'HOIR and MAGUY MacDONALD\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 9, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHISTORICALLY since 1975, small-cap equities have outperformed large-cap equities by an average of 4 per cent in years of GDP expansion, according to MSCI data. In line with our expectation that the global economy will accelerate in 2014, we are convinced that smaller companies will be the beneficiaries of the current expansionary phase of the global economy, reinforcing our conviction that investors should give small cap equities real consideration in their portfolios.\n\nDespite this phenomenon, small caps have been consistently overlooked by investors for years. Smaller companies represent an under-owned asset class, though this is not a wholly intentional decision by investors. Institutional investors, in particular, have \"unconsciously\" adopted an underweight position in smaller companies. The reasons are manifold.\n\nMoves away from equities and into bonds, and away from regional and into global portfolios, have clearly contributed. Academic work also highlights a general preference on the part of institutional investors for large and liquid equity holdings.\n\nThis underweight remains the case even though the benefits of holding smaller companies as part of a diverse portfolio have been documented at length.\n\nIn addition, small caps have been subject to a number of myths or misconceptions, the most significant in our view being that small caps are \"only\" a high beta play, the beta being explained by small cap returns that are strongly correlated to the economic cycle, and, consequently, highly vulnerable to economic downturns.\n\nAdmittedly, small caps have been more sensitive to the economic cycle than large caps over the last 40 years. However, the behaviour of small caps since the first jolt of the financial crisis defies this conventionally-accepted wisdom, and reflects what we consider to be a series of structural changes at play in the small cap investment universe.\n\nNewfound resilience\n\nBased on historical trends, in 2008 and early 2009, when the United States economy collapsed and developed economies experienced the deepest recession since World War II, the relative performances of small cap firms should have also plummeted given the sensitivity of the excess returns of small caps (over those of large caps) to cyclical economic fluctuations. Curiously, this did not occur: US small caps performed in line with large caps, and have strongly outperformed since then.\n\nThis evidence suggests that small caps are now in a better position to absorb downward macro shocks while maintaining their rebound potential when economic growth accelerates, as in 2010 and in 2013.\n\nThis observation is confirmed by our analysis of the relative monthly performance of small caps to large caps according to changes in the ISM manufacturing index, an indicator of economic conditions (ISM readings above 50 indicate growth in the manufacturing sector while readings below 50 indicate contraction).\n\nOver the 2000-2013 period, our sensitivity analysis reveals that if the ISM is higher than 50, then an increase in the ISM by one point implies an increase in small cap monthly outperformance by 140 basis points on average, while small caps and large caps behave similarly for ISM numbers below 50.\n\nEarnings less impacted by economic downturn\n\nWhile economic conditions continue to have a significant impact on small caps, their earnings are now much more resilient to economic downturns than in the past. This is evidenced by the way the two components of earnings growth - top-line growth and margin variations - behaved during the two main cyclical downturns of the last 20 years, in 2000-2001 and 2008-2009.\n\nDuring the downturn of 2000-2001, US GDP growth decelerated to virtually zero, while total sales slumped by almost 10 per cent and profit margins slid into negative territory (-5.5 per cent). During the downturn of 2008-2009, US GDP fell 4 per cent, while total sales declined by only 7 per cent and profit margins dropped to -7 per cent.\n\nIf in 2009 the sensitivity of top-line growth and margins to US GDP growth had been the same as in 2001, the fall in revenues and margins would have been roughly double. Thus, small caps proved significantly more resilient in 2009 than in 2001, demonstrating that the sensitivity of small cap earnings to cyclical headwinds has declined.\n\nOne reason the earnings of small cap firms have become more resilient is the geographic diversification of their revenue base. The share of foreign sales in total sales of US small caps has increased from 11 per cent to around 17 per cent over the last two decades.\n\nThe same broadly holds true for European small cap companies which have built a very strong presence in Asia or the United States.\n\nStrong play on structural growth\n\nAnother, and in our view, the most important, factor for this newfound resilience stems from the fact that small caps have preserved their ability to grow faster than large companies through their increased exposure to structural growth stories.\n\nUS small caps have been able to post a 15 per cent compound annual growth rate for earnings per share (EPS) since early 2000, compared to 5.5 per cent for large caps, while at the same time the aggregate volatility of small cap top-line growth has declined.\n\nThis stellar EPS growth has been fuelled in part by what we call disruptive technologies, that is, leading to entirely new products and services.\n\nAs part of this shift from cyclical to structural growth exposure, small cap companies move up the value chain. As a result, their profiles change and they increasingly make their presence felt in high value added sectors.\n\nOne advantage that their lesser size offers smaller firms is greater agility to fully leverage secular growth opportunities as they arise. Their agility helps them to i) swiftly navigate paradigm shifts, ii) quickly seize upon regulatory changes even in mature markets, and iii) innovate successfully.\n\nNavigating paradigm shifts\n\nA concrete example of the ability of small caps to adapt and profit from disruptive technologies is the US energy sector. Many small oil exploration & production (E&P) companies have generated double-digit revenue and earnings growth from the unconventional oil and gas boom.\n\nNorth American small and mid-cap E&P companies have decreased their costs and increased revenue with substantial improvement in earnings growth.\n\nWhiting Petroleum is one such E&P firm. One of the first-movers in the fast-growing Bakken basin/Three Forks area - a strong, rich shale oil and gas basin where Whiting began drilling in 2007 - the firm applied its innovative cost control and completion methods, along with its willingness to take the lead in critical midstream elements like processing and pipelines, in order to establish itself as an active leader.\n\nSeizing upon regulatory changes\n\nThe French telecommunications sector offers a clear example of the ability of small firms to quickly benefit from regulatory changes. In 2009, the French telecommunications regulatory agency (ARCEP) recognised that a market made up of three incumbent mobile providers was not optimal for competition and thus sold a 3G spectrum licence to Iliad, an alternative telecoms carrier, for 240 million euros (S$415 million).\n\nIliad, already a challenger in the landline phone business, became the fourth mobile operator and quickly seized 15 per cent market share in the mobile telecom market in just one year. This success story helped Iliad outgrow the small cap universe, pushing its market cap up to close to 10 billion euros.\n\nIncreasingly successful innovators\n\nThe ability of small cap companies to innovate is particularly visible in the technology and biotech sectors. In the latter, many therapeutic breakthroughs have been initiated by small biotech companies. In 2012, small biotech companies were awarded 50 per cent of drug approvals in the US.\n\nThis significant gain in drug approvals over the prior year has translated into very strong stock performance. Small cap biotech stocks are clearly outperforming the rest of the small cap arena.\n\nThe focus on R&D and intellectual property has clearly enabled small caps to sustain product leadership and competitive advantages.\n\nM&A targets\n\nThanks to their focus on innovation and structural growth, small cap performance is, more than ever, driven by mergers and acquisitions (M&A), since they are often acquired by larger firms trying to gain access to crucial technology or new markets, resulting in substantial gains for small cap investors.\n\nBig data and cloud computing have been major disruptive trends. Software as a Service (SaaS) has emerged as an alternative to traditional licensed software products. Small cap cloud computing companies are now challenging traditional software, data and solutions suppliers.\n\nSubscription- and consumption-based models are cannibalising the traditional software licence purchase model at an accelerating pace, leading to a raft of consolidation in this space. Established software companies such as Oracle and SAP have snapped up several smaller companies in order to gain exposure to these fast-growing markets.\n\nA prominent example is Ariba, a small software and IT services company specialising in web-based procurement, which was purchased by SAP with a 20 per cent premium last year.\n\nWith many large cap firms sitting on huge piles of cash in today's low growth economic environment, there is a natural tendency for companies to acquire growth: over the last 20 years, 88 per cent of all M&A targets in Europe were small and medium-sized companies - paying an average premium of 28 per cent.\n\nWe expect small cap exposure to structural growth to remain attractive for large caps as M&A targets in the future.\n\nInvesting in small caps\n\nHarnessing the potential of small caps is not as straightforward as investing in large caps, however.\n\nFirst, the opportunity set is much greater than for larger companies: the standard MSCI World Index comprises some 1,500 names, rising to over 4,000 for the MSCI World Small Cap Index, an investment universe that is challenging for most active investment managers to cover.\n\nSecond, smaller companies are, by their nature, more volatile than their larger brethren. In fact, while the agility of smaller firms brings many advantages, there is a flip side. Developments presented here, such as moving up the value chain, pioneering trends, and leading product innovation, often entail company-level decisions with no guarantee of success, making them a significant source of specific risk among small cap companies in the medium to long term.\n\nTherefore, alpha opportunities in the small cap arena abound. First, small caps exhibit a wider dispersion of returns than other equities. Second, lower (or non-existent) analyst coverage of small cap firms contributes to wider gaps between a firm's share price and its fundamental value. Third, we currently see significant mispricing in the market.\n\nLet's examine each of these factors in turn.\n\nHigher return dispersion\n\nThe spread of monthly returns is clearly greater among smaller companies when compared to large. At the same time, we note higher levels of specific risk associated with smaller companies, although specific risk associated with both large and small cap companies is currently at historically low levels.\n\nThis dispersion of returns presents an array of mispricing opportunities for active stock pickers to capitalise on.\n\nUnder a smaller microscope\n\nAlthough smaller companies have to some extent diversified their revenues, as outlined previously, their earnings are often still perceived to be more volatile and less easy to predict, something that is compounded by the lack of coverage by analysts and magnifies the potential for mispricing at the stock level.\n\nIn the United States, for example, a typical large cap stock is covered by an average of 24 analysts. The number of analysts falls to just seven for smaller companies, though many smaller firms are simply not covered at all.\n\nThis means that among larger companies the gap between a company's share price and its fundamental value is often small, even fractional in the largest and most well-covered companies, whereas this dispersion can be a lot higher among smaller companies.\n\nSignificant price inefficiencies\n\nA number of factors, including a lack of investor familiarity with small caps, less analyst coverage, higher volatility, and lower liquidity, contribute to significant price inefficiencies.\n\nThis type of environment creates opportunities for a successful stock-picker to add value over and above the beta available from a passive allocation to smaller companies. The greater price \"spread\" of smaller companies creates more opportunity to arbitrage this spread away.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, we can see that today's market offers high levels of valuation opportunity. To show this point, we rank the universe of stocks from high fair value to price ratio (undervalued stocks) to low fair value to price ratio (overvalued stocks).\n\nThen, we split the ranking in half and divide the average undervaluation of the first group by the average overvaluation of the second group. For small caps, over time, the spread between the two halves has moved to levels not reached since the tech bubble of 2000.\n\nThis implies that there is significant mis-pricing within the small cap market, which provides a good environment for active strategies. Further, it shows that within the global small cap universe the opportunity to add value through stock picking appears to be much greater than for large caps, both currently and historically.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFor investors contemplating an allocation to small cap equities, an important consideration is whether this valuation gap will compress. If this occurs, it will benefit active investors.\n\nThe clearest way to flesh out an indication is by examining the equity rally currently underway. The initial stage of the equity rally witnessed so far has been driven by a sharp re-rating of valuation multiples. We think two independent forces have been at work here: i) massive liquidity injections led by the Federal Reserve (QE3) and ii) fading systemic risk in the eurozone.\n\nWith the first stage of the rally gradually coming to an end, a key theme that will move to the fore as 2014 unfolds becomes clear: earnings growth will take over from the declining liquidity booster.\n\nCompany fundamentals will become increasingly important, favouring the convergence of small cap prices towards their fair value, and thus benefiting active investors.\n\nOne element to watch over the course of this transition will be company leverage. For smaller companies with limited access to capital markets, leverage is an important tool for participating in a recovery and can help a firm grow.\n\nHowever, with the potential for interest rate rises on the horizon, it is important for investors to be able to differentiate between strong companies that use leverage well and have sufficient income to cover their debt and weaker ones that may be distressed or at risk of default.\n\nThis means that, for investors, avoiding bad stocks will become as important as picking good ones.\n\nThe breadth of the universe multiplies the investment opportunities. Combine this with strong exposure to structural growth stories, significant levels of mispricing, low coverage yet a favourable investment outlook and the opportunities for stock pickers to add value from smaller companies seem plentiful as we move into 2014.\n\nGreater investor focus on this overlooked asset class should help narrow the spread and turn the small cap beta to alpha for investors.\n\nAlec Harper is from AXA Rosenberg, Mathieu L'Hoir is from AXA IM Research & Investment Strategy, and Maguy MacDonald is from AXA Framlington\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those who make the cut will be informed in due course.\n\nHe explained that, with these parameters, a pioneer today would have been about 16 years or older at independence back in 1965. Many people in those days started working in their late-teens.\n\nAlso included is Singapore's first batch of national servicemen, who were called up in 1967.\n\nExplaining why the government chose to include those who became citizens by the end of 1986, Mr Lee said that it was because of the lack of complete data on registration records up to that point in time.\n\nThe prime minister added that for the other older Singaporeans who do not meet the criteria for the package, the government would \"continue to take care of you in many other ways, and enable you to look after yourself and your families, as we do all other Singaporeans\".\n\nAddressing the 1,000-strong audience in Malay earlier, Mr Lee had a special mention for the pioneers in the Malay community. He noted that many of them had chosen to remain in Singapore after the country separated from Malaysia, and this had helped the Republic become a multi-racial and multi-religious society.\n\n\"We have thought carefully and consulted widely about what would be meaningful and helpful to you. We know that healthcare is at the top of the minds of older Singaporeans,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nHe gave the assurance to pioneers that they would enjoy the enhanced benefits of the new MediShield Life national health insurance scheme but pay less than what they do under the existing MediShield.\n\nAs for outpatient treatment, they will get extra subsidies at specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme - on top of all the other subsidies that they already enjoy.\n\nOn the plan to give more top-ups to the Medisave accounts of pioneers, Mr Lee noted that many of them do not have much in their balances today because the scheme had not yet been introduced when they were working. Their salaries and eventual Medisave contributions were also much lower during their working years.\n\nOverall, Mr Lee said that the package would reduce the medical expenses of these pioneers.\n\n\"This is a special package for a special generation. No matter how we design the package, it can never fully reflect the contributions our pioneers have made to our nation,\" said Mr Lee. \"I hope you will accept it as a sincere expression of our gratitude, and that it will be of help to you and your families.\"\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will announce the full details of the Pioneer Generation Package when he delivers his annual Budget speech in parliament on Feb 21.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are a hospitality and commercial project at Stevens Road, where the Pines Club was located, and an industrial project at Tampines Industrial Crescent.\n\nTo date, the group has launched 27 projects. As of Feb 7, 21 projects are 95 per cent or more sold. The remaining are Oxley Edge (92 per cent), The Midtown & Midtown Residences (94 per cent), NEWest (82 per cent), The Flow (50 per cent), Floraville (50 per cent) and Eco-Tech@Sunview (62 per cent).\n\nOxley has also been expanding aggressively overseas. It now has a pipeline of eight projects in Malaysia, one in London, UK, four in Cambodia, and two in China.\n\nThe accounting requirement that caused the lumpy earnings recognition this quarter is known as the completion of contract (COC) method used for commercial properties.

China sales fell 12 per cent to 108.2 million yuan. China sales amounted to 54.5 per cent of Yongmao's revenue for the quarter, compared with 67.4 per cent of revenue the same period a year ago.\n\nExecutive director and group general manager Sun Tian said there was significant improvement in the company's export markets in the US and Europe as their economies are recovering.\n\n\"China is still our major market and we foresee ongoing domestic demand as China continues its investment in infrastructure and residential projects,\" he said.\n\nMr Sun added that the company was actively pursuing growth in South-east Asia, notably Malaysia and Myanmar.\n\n\"Higher construction activity, driven by stronger infrastructure needs, continues to feed demand for quality tower cranes in Asia,\" he said, adding that the company is aware of market risks such as currency losses and potential higher material and operating costs.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was 40.3 million yuan, more than double the 16.6 million yuan a year ago. This was due to higher margins from luffing crane sales.\n\nRevenue was up 27 per cent at 689.1 million yuan due to stronger demand.\n\nYongmao is 24 per cent owned by crane supplier Tat Hong, which is expected to unveil its quarterly results on Thursday. The two are restructuring their crane rental joint venture in China to sort out interested-person transaction issues.\n\nEarnings per share for the quarter were 2.78 RMB cents, up from 0.47 RMB cent a year ago. Nine-month earnings per share were 9.08 cents, up from 3.74 cents a year ago. Net asset value as at end-2013 was 116.89 RMB cents.\n\nYongmao said the appreciation of the yuan against the US and Singapore dollars, combined with potentially higher operating and raw material costs, could hit margins. \"However, the group may adjust selling prices where necessary to mitigate the cost increase,\" it said.\n\nYongmao last traded at 18.9 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Each B787-8 costs the airline US$211.8 million while each B787-9s costs US$249.5 million.\n\nThe first five planes to be delivered will be the B787-9s. Scoot expects to have about nine new aircraft by next year. The B787-9s will fly to Japan, Australia and Taiwan initially and the airline will progressively retire its current fleet of Boeing 777-200s by the middle of next year. Its six B777s were passed down from SIA and have an average load factor of 81 per cent across its 13 destinations.\n\nWhile Scoot's B777s have a seating capacity of 402, the B787-9s will have 375 seats, and the B787-8s, around 330 seats. Besides improved cabin humidity, passengers will have access to inseat power and wireless Internet connectivity.\n\nWith the new fleet, Scoot chief executive officer Campbell Wilson said that customers can expect cheaper airfares. The Dreamliners, primarily made of carbon-fibre composite material, are lighter and more fuel-efficient than similar-sized airplanes.\n\nMr Wilson said that they would cut fuel costs by about 20 per cent. As fuel costs account for around half of the airline's expenditure, the Dreamliners will bring about some 10 per cent in cost savings.\n\n\"We plan to pass some or most of the cost savings on to consumers,\" he said.\n\nWhile the airline awaits delivery of its new fleet, he said Scoot will not add new destinations this year. The airline will focus its efforts on partnerships with Tigerair and Nok Air, a low-cost airline based in Bangkok.\n\nHe also revealed that Scoot had set aside some $60 million for its tie-up with Nok Air to establish a new low-cost airline, NokScoot, based at Don Muang International Airport. Scoot's retired B777s may possibly go to NokScoot. The initial investment from both parties is around $40 million, and Scoot will have a 49 per cent stake.\n\nScoot is seeking regulatory approval for the joint venture, but aims to start operations for NokScoot in the second half of this year. It will operate on medium and long-haul international routes, and its destinations will mainly be in North Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea. Scoot's alliance with Tigerair awaits approval from the Competition Commission of Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company also inked a Memorandum of Understanding with the agency yesterday at the 3rd Aerospace Technology Leadership Forum to facilitate research collaboration, starting with data analytics.\n\nMr Krein says the developments in Big Data analytics - the process of finding patterns from examining large and complex data - will help Airbus offer its customers better operational data analysis to cut fuel consumption.\n\nBesides data analytics, there are seven other areas of research under the AP including the development of engine materials and coats, and additive manufacturing and repair. They come under the AP's five main research areas - advanced materials, manufacturing processes and automation, information and communication, inspection and non-destructive testing, and computational modelling and dynamics.\n\nResearch in these areas will enable faster turnaround time and the development of new airframe materials and engines for the aviation industry. Launched in 2007, the AP has commissioned 53 projects so far in these five areas with several big industry players such as Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney.\n\n\"The combined expertise of our members in commercial aviation is humbling and we look forward to how we can contribute to the future of aviation and the interests of each of our members,\" said Tay Kok Khiang, chairman of A*star AP.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it has opened a new office here to house its Executive Briefing Centre under a US$20 million-plus expansion plan for Asia, Telstra's Martin Bishop said. The centre offers Telstra Global's various networking services and products to potential customers beyond core connectivity, such as IP telephony and cloud. It employs over 120 people, and strives to be its regional innovation hub.\n\n\"Currently, Singapore serves as the headquarters for South and East Asia for Telstra global sales and our product portfolio is also based here,\" said Mr Bishop, who is head of network applications and services.\n\nHeadquartered in Hong Kong, Telstra Global is part of Telstra Corporation Limited, a leading telecommunications and information services company in Australia. Telstra Global provides customers across Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Americas with a full breadth of holistic and end-to-end solutions including managed network services, data, voice, and satellite solutions.\n\n\"Through our strategic investments over the years, we now own one of the most technologically advanced IP (Internet Protocol) backbone networks in the world, through a number of global subsidiaries. We have licences in Asia, Europe and the Americas and facilitate access to over 1,900 PoPs (point-of-presence) in 230 countries and territories across the globe,\" he said.\n\nTelstra Global is also part of Telstra Global Enterprise Services, which comprises the Telstra enterprise division in Australia and the Network, Application, Services (NAS) business. The intention of this business unit is to focus on growth opportunities within Asia through onward investments, deploying disruptive technologies in the region and across the world, and growing international and local customer relationships.\n\nMr Bishop said that over the past 12 months the company has expanded its operation. \"We have obtained a licence to operate in Taiwan, expanded our presence in the United States by partnering with CenturyLink and expanded three new PoPs in China through a partnership with China Telecom. We have also invested in adding new 100G submarine cable technology on the UNITY cable route to meet the increasing demands of Trans-Pacific and Asia-Pacific customers.\"\n\nAsia-Pacific is one of Telstra Global's key growth areas due to the region's vast economic potential, particularly in the current global financial climate, he added.\n\n\"Within Asia, Telstra Global is uniquely positioned to serve multinational companies (MNC) operating within the region, with headquarters and offices in countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, among others, as well as businesses from the US, Europe, and other global MNCs looking to expand into Asia. For example, currently Telstra Global provides Robert Walters, one of the top global recruitment specialists, with Internet Protocol Virtual Private Network (IPVPN) that connects its existing operations in Asia more effectively with their global network, supporting 1,500 users in 36 offices worldwide.\"\n\nMr Bishop noted that in the vertical markets, financial services and manufacturing are lucrative areas of growth in the region. Talking about technology trends, he added that cloud computing has now become a mainstream technology and more businesses are moving to the cloud because of the proven benefits like cost efficiencies, greater flexibility, and more importantly, data security.\n\n\"However, in Asia, cloud adoption is currently inconsistent, with pockets of high adoption in markets like Korea and Japan and low penetration in other markets like Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Malaysia. As the quality of infrastructure continues to improve in emerging markets like Indonesia and Malaysia, cloud adoption rates will also eventually grow until there is a unified level of service in every location, ensuring smooth and efficient operations and services for end users.\"\n\nTalking about another top growth area, Unified Communications (UC), Mr Bishop quoted research reports to say that the UC market is expected to hit US$61.9 billion in 2018 with a compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent. \"Rapid advancement in technology has made various UC methods like video conferencing, instant messaging, online data sharing, among others, more accessible to the end user. Backed up by reliable, low-latency networks from vendors like Telstra Global and the availability of supporting devices like smartphones and tablets will further encourage and enable the adoption of UC tools for day-to-day use at work.\"\n\nMr Bishop added that the company has a significant network and service growth in Europe and the US. \"Recently three PoPs were launched in Europe with plans for another five to six in the pipeline for the financial year.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bumper profits reaped from its projects there made it a stockmarket darling in 2006-2010.\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008, the developer has been focusing on building a strong recurring income base from property investment. It sold off fringe investment properties here and bought a site in 2010 next to Buona Vista MRT Interchange Station, which it has developed into a 1.08 million square foot project with two office towers called The Metropolis.\n\n\"GFC was an experience that made us rethink our strategy of just focusing on our development engine for growth,\" chairman Chua Thian Poh tells BT. \"Our development model was based on rapid recycling of capital through pre-sales.\n\n\"We decided that it was equally important to develop our investment engine as well for recurring income. The investment income will help smoothen out our lumpy earnings and more importantly, act as a stabiliser in times of crisis.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Chua, who is also CEO, reckons the outlook for the Republic's residential market will be \"very bleak\" for the next two to three years, given looming oversupply and various property cooling measures. \"If we had just carried on doing development, today we would not have these two office blocks,\" he declares in his new office at The Metropolis.\n\nCompleted last year, the Green Mark Platinum project is now more than 92 per cent let. It is also a showcase of Ho Bee's support for the arts, with sculptures by Ju Ming of Taiwan, Gao Xiao Wu and Zhu Wei of China, and Fernando Botero of Colombia.\n\n\"With the completion of The Metropolis, we have built up strong recurrent income to act as a backstop for earnings growth during the next two or three difficult years,\" says Mr Chua.\n\nAlso augmenting recurring income is rental income from leasing unsold units in the group's last three Sentosa Cove condo projects. Although Ho Bee did roaring sales in the district for earlier projects, activity in the luxe market has not recovered after the crisis - unlike the spectacular mass-market boom.\n\nLast May, Ho Bee re-entered London and picked up an office block near Southwark Bridge in the Bankside locale, capitalising on the weak pound. A government tenant locked in till September 2018 ensures net rental yield of more than 6 per cent. Rose Court, an 11-storey freehold office building near the Thames, offers prospects of strong positive rental reversion. When the lease expires in 2018, the group plans to refurbish Rose Court and possibly convert some space to residences, especially on the top floor, subject to planning approval to capitalise on scenic views.\n\nLocated near Shakespeare's Globe, Rose Court itself has the famous Rose Theatre in its basement. The remains of the original Elizabethan theatre were discovered in 1989 during building excavations for the Rose Court project and preserved. Rose Theatre is owned by a heritage group.\n\nWhile building recurring income is Ho Bee's priority, it is not ditching the property development business. \"We are expecting development income from China and Australia to boost our earnings from 2015/2016 onwards,\" says Mr Chua.\n\nDown Under, the group expects to launch this weekend a 185-unit project in Melbourne's Doncaster area, which is popular with Asians. Pearl, next to a Westfield shopping mall, will comprise nine townhouses and 176 apartments, mostly one and two-bedders. Prices are expected to start from around A$325,000 (S$369,335) for a one-bedder (679 sq ft) and A$438,000 for a two-bedder (819 sq ft). The areas are inclusive of balcony and terrace areas.\n\nLater this year, the group plans to launch its first Gold Coast project, Rhapsody, a 41-storey development with 223 apartments (again mostly one and two-bedders). \"Our development will be less than 50 metres from a light rail station that will be operational around the middle of this year,\" says Mr Chua.\n\nThe light rail line also extends to another site in Broadbeach where it plans to build a commercial and residential project. The site is next to Pacific Fair Shopping Centre as well as the new light rail station (integrated with a bus terminal). The Broadbeach project is at planning stage, as is the group's third Gold Coast project at 180 Ferny Avenue, near the Rhapsody site.\n\nThe A$24-49 per square foot per plot ratio Ho Bee paid for the four freehold Australian sites in 2012-2013 is cheap compared with Singapore. \"In Australia, land cost is relatively low as a percentage of development cost. Moreover, we went in at a time when the market was quite depressed,\" says Mr Chua. \"Gold Coast is a boom-and-bust place. (Property prices) can go up and come down very dramatically.\"\n\nThe Gold Coast is attracting mainland Chinese. In addition, Ho Bee's projects capitalise on the shortage of one and two-bedroom apartments in the market. \"The Australian dollar has also come off quite a bit, which makes buying property there more affordable,\" Mr Chua adds, noting also that the 2018 Commonwealth Games would be held there.\n\nHo Bee's diversification into London and Australia serves to reduce concentration risk in China, where it has three joint venture developments in which initial phases are under construction. In Shanghai's Qingpu District, where the group owns 40 per cent of a 1,173-unit residential project, marketing will begin towards year-end for the first phase (620 units).\n\nThe group also has 40 per cent interest in a project in Nanhu Eco City in Tangshan. Soft marketing for the first phase began late last year. Construction is under way for the first three phases (totalling 990 apartments). To be built over seven phases, the project will have 1,867 apartments and a small retail component.\n\nIn Zhuhai, Ho Bee owns 20 per cent of a 3,600-unit residential development to be built in four phases. The launch of the first phase of 1,000 homes is expected to start towards year-end.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Chua wants to reap returns from these projects before putting more money into China, to manage concentration risks. For Australia, Ho Bee continues to look for development sites, primarily residential, and will stick to Gold Coast and Melbourne in the short term, he adds. In London, it makes sense to look for investment properties, most likely commercial buildings, given the attractive positive carry - the spread between property yield and cost of debt.\n\nMr Chua says that the group would re-enter the Singapore residential market when the opportunity arises. It is also open to further commercial property projects here. \"We are in a good position now to seize opportunities as our gearing (as at end-September 2013) is only 0.19 time. In future, we'll have twin engines: development and property investment.\n\n\"The development engine will be more turbo; in good times, we get higher profits. But the investment income ... when you go into a storm, it stabilises the company.\"\n\nkalpana@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/nine-year-rule", "site_title": "The Nine-Year Rule", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe Nine-Year Rule\n\nThe revised Code of Corporate Governance obliquely implies that time on a Board could affect a director , but continuity has its advantages, says DAVID CONNER\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 9, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nONE of the new provisions in the revised Code of Corporate Governance released in May 2012 is the so called \"Nine Year Rule\". This has engendered much discussion and could potentially result in significant movements within the boardrooms of corporate Singapore.\n\nGuideline 2.4 of the Code states that \"the independence of any director who has served beyond nine years from the date of his first appointment should be subject to particularly rigorous review. In doing so, the Board should also take into account the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. The Board should also explain why any such director should be considered independent.\"\n\nThis apparent link between a director's tenure of service and his independence deserves closer examination.\n\nFew would argue against the Code's prescription that there should be a strong and independent element on each Board. It helps ensure that decisions are properly and objectively made.\n\nFurther, the Code exhorts Boards to determine, taking into account the views of the Nominating Committee, whether a director is independent in character and judgement, and whether there are relationships which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director's judgement.\n\nThe key to a director's independence therefore seems to be his \"character\" and \"judgement\". Yet the Code, through the Nine Year Rule, obliquely implies that time on the Board could affect a director's character and/or judgement.\n\nIt can be said that the basic character of any individual does not really change with time. As a banker of 36 years, I am well acquainted with the basic credit principles represented by the \"4 C's of credit\" - character, collateral, capacity and cash flow. In my experience, when it comes to repaying a debt, character does not change over time. If so, assuming a director is independent in character on the day he is appointed, he will then continue to be independent in character, even beyond nine years' service on the Board.\n\nAs for judgement, it frequently and often improves with time. We are, after all, taught to respect the wisdom of our elders. The Code implies, however, that familiarity with the business or management team could affect a director's judgement. On the other hand, one could argue to the contrary that familiarity with the business and management team is a valuable characteristic which Boards should seek and retain in their directors.\n\nWhile the Code recognises the need for progressive refreshing of the Board, thereby ensuring that fresh perspectives are continually brought onto the Board, the need for Board renewal needs to be balanced with the need for Board continuity.\n\nFamiliarity with a business can be very useful when business cycles come into play, particularly long business cycles. Directors, who can remember mistakes of the past first hand by having been there, are more likely to steer the Board and management away from repeating those mistakes. The philosopher George Santayana once said: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" Although extensive experience with a business should be a quality that is highly valued, the Code suggests that Boards should \"penalise\" long serving directors when it comes to assessing their independence.\n\nIt is therefore critical that Boards are made fully aware that the need to refresh their Boards is an issue which is separate and distinct from the issue of assessing the independence of any particular individual director.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Code does leave it to the Board's discretion, with the assistance of the Nominating Committee, when assessing the independence of long serving directors, even though this particular issue is \"subject to particularly rigorous review\". I trust that Boards will, notwithstanding the Nine Year Rule, have the courage to retain long serving independent directors who are truly independent in character and judgement.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Governing Council of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closed on Sun\n\nWE know how it feels. You're staring at the money-changer's glittering LED screen watching the Thai baht go down, down, down, as you finger your wad of Singapore dollars muttering, \"Should I? Should I? Should I?\" before skulking away as self-preservation instincts overcome your craving for kuay tiau pad see ew or hoy tod in Bangkok's Yaowarat district.\n\nEven as political unrest gets in the way of your regular Bangkok sojourns, there's at least some culinary consolation to be found in Longtail Asian Brasserie - a new street food joint that manages to merge stylised chic and side-alley grit into a very palatable combination.\n\nOn the one hand, this little sister of the more upmarket Sabai Fine Thai next door has all the trappings of your typical CBD watering-hole-cum-bar-bites outfit with its cool bistro persona, Asian-inspired cocktails and chic platings of street favourites from Vietnamese spring rolls to Chiang Mai-style fermented sausages.\n\nBut bite into a juicy morsel of tongue-tingling sour yet juicy fatty pork ball or breathe in the intoxicating aroma of nam pla and other indistinguishable smells in a steaming bowl of boat noodles, and you're almost transported to itinerant hawker heaven, complete with a garnish of sewer. Which is, by the way, a compliment. After all, it's that element of skankiness that makes the difference between clinical recipes and the earthy authenticity of street-side cooking.\n\nThe bonus is that you get that authenticity without the dubious hygiene issues at Longtail, which boasts a compact repertoire of familiar favourites from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, with even a sprinkling of Cantonese (by way of wonton noodle soup).\n\nWith someone like Jongkolnee Thoboonme - aka Ms Noo, aka the lady who first brought Thai royal cuisine (and the dessert buffet) to Singapore with the original Thanying in the Amara Hotel - at the helm, you can expect a level of authenticity that is hard to find in Singapore.\n\nThe non-Thai choices, however, are middling - witness the over-refrigerated, tough-skinned fresh Vietnamese rice paper rolls ($12) otherwise generously packed with shredded vegetables, prawns and pork, and a bland pho bo ($22) priced not so much for flavour but the large amount of boiled beef and oxtail that elbow for space with a clump of rice noodles in the stingy amount of broth.\n\nZero in instead on the flavour-packed morsels that make up the deep-fried sour pork sausage ($14) with five precious balls evenly balanced in piquancy and meatiness, garnished with raw cabbage and ginger slices and fried peanuts to take the tart edge off. Check out also the Isaan-inspired tender strips of marinated and grilled pork shoulder ($14) - good enough on its own but even better dipped into the treacly tamarind-based dip that comes with it and also with the banana leaf parcel of slightly dry glutinous rice.\n\nWhile the pho is a bit of a disappointment, it's outshone by Longtail's interpretation of the classic Thai boat noodles or kway tiau reua ($16). It's served without the ubiquitous shot of pig's blood and fresh liver, but is nonetheless a satisfyingly pungent bowl of chicken broth enlivened with a potpourri of seasonings including garlic, fish sauce, chilli, lime, crushed peanuts and crispy lard bits.\n\nSurprisingly juicy char siew, fish balls, crispy wonton skin and slippery thin noodles wrap up this mental stopover at Mahboonkrong's food court.\n\nIf something a little more hefty is in order, the Massaman lamb shank ($21.50) is a rendang-like rib-sticker with its chunky gravy thickened with sweet potatoes and peanuts, while the Vientiane chicken curry ($14.50) is lighter albeit less memorable apart from its distinctive bamboo shoot and basil aroma.\n\nDesserts, meanwhile, are limited to a predictable but well-executed sago in coconut milk with fresh coconut flesh and melon balls ($7). Just remember that the sago will taste bitter if you eat this after the Pang Yen ($7), a weird but strangely appealing (in an artificial way) concoction of ice-blended bandung (rose syrup and milk) swirled like ice cream on top of bread cubes and garnished with palm seeds.\n\nThe bandung soaks the bread into a mushy mixture that's too alien for us, although the blended bandung has that cough mixture flavour trait that might appeal to some.\n\nStrange though it is, there's this sense of discovery - in the way that you trawl through a Bangkok food court or alley stumbling across strange new things to eat - that makes Longtail a brief substitute for the real thing. Either that, or we really miss Bangkok.\n\nNow, if only Longtail can be persuaded to accept payment in Thai baht...\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Asia-Pacific planes on order make up 36 per cent of the world total and the figure is rising, says Airbus.\n\nAlready last year, available capacity grew faster than passenger demand in countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, putting pressure on yields or the average revenue per passenger for every kilometre flown.\n\nThat could extend further in 2014 as carriers in South-east Asia take delivery of about 230 aircraft worth over US$20 billion this year, at a rate close to one new jet every working day.\n\nOne such aircraft is a short-haul Boeing 737 now making its way to the region and due to reach Singapore's SilkAir in time to be shown off at the Feb 11-16 air show.\n\nOne reason many airlines have been ordering at once is that engine improvements now allow significant fuel savings.\n\nAmple liquidity provided by money-printing central banks has also made it easier to fund the relatively small upfront payments needed to place headline-grabbing plane orders.\n\nBut bankers warn the race to buy efficient aircraft in anticipation of high demand could spell trouble for the sector.\n\n\"When you run an airline, you want a new kit, so you order an aircraft. And if your neighbour orders aircraft, so you order aircraft,\" said Bertrand Grabowski who heads German bank DVB's aviation and land transport finance divisions. \"I wouldn't call it irrational exuberance but clearly everybody in Asia is ordering aircraft more than they really need.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

However, Indonesia's Jupiter Aerobatic team, due to perform at the air show, said on its Twitter and Facebook pages that they are still attending.\n\nThe diplomatic row began after Indonesia decided to name a new navy ship after the two Indonesian marines who bombed Orchard Road's MacDonald House in 1965, killing three and injuring 33. The two marines, Osman Mohamed Ali and Harun Said, were tried and hanged in Singapore for murder. But they were considered heroes in Indonesia for doing their duty as soldiers. The two were part of then-president Sukarno's armed campaign against the formation of Malaysia, which Singapore was part of then.\n\nSingapore ministers have objected to the move to name the naval frigate KRI Usman Harun, saying the act was insensitive and would reopen old wounds.

How does one manage this? I mean, Singapore is so small that the species known as the Total Stranger is officially extinct.\n\nThese days, you can't pick up someone at a bar and not find out the next morning that this person went to school with your colleague's wife's second cousin's karaoke buddy.\n\nIn fact, this place is so small that even if you were to send a photo of just your privates to a \"total stranger\", I'll be damned if the recipient doesn't squint at it for a while before saying: \"Eh, that's Ah Seng from reservist, lah. I told him to get that mole checked.\"\n\nIn any case, I'd like to give this minority group the benefit of the doubt and assume that they'd inadvertently sexted the wrong person.\n\nIf this is the case, we deserve to have our birthrate surpassed by that of pandas'. If we have not mastered the art of jabbing at smartphone buttons with our fingers, we have no business waving other body parts at other people.\n\nInevitably, one has to wonder what counts as sexy, risque talk for the practical, hard-driving Singaporean.\n\n\"Let's get married first and THEN ballot for a flat!\"\n\n\"You put the 'hard' in 'hardware'.\"\n\n\"I go toy-let. Hold my handbag.\"\n\nIn any case, half the population is going about this sexting business wrong - Match.com's survey of single people in the US found that 75 per cent of women don't enjoy getting sexy photos from men.\n\nInstead, women tend towards non-sexual communication. What they want, according to 76 per cent of those surveyed, is emoticons.\n\nBe careful what you wish for, ladies. With any luck, men will find a way to combine the sexual with emoticons, and women will end up getting this: 8====> (given how men tend to overrate themselves, maybe it'll look more like this: 8===========> ).\n\nNext Friday, as we consider the value of our relationships (at least $200 for a bouquet of flowers), it is comforting to know that undying love is built on a bedrock of territoriality and suspiciousness.\n\nAccording to the McAfee survey, three out of four Singaporeans admitted to nosing through messages and photos on their other half's mobile device.\n\nThis means that three out of four Singaporeans have trust issues, and one out of every four is a liar.\n\nI don't blame people, though; I blame technology. Passcodes are a terrible way to keep your mobile phone secure. If women want to keep their men out of their phones, the security question should be: \"What was I wearing when I left the house today?\"\n\n(There is no parallel security question for men who want to stymie their wives. Any man who is still married knows that whatever the answer, the woman is right.)\n\nRather distressingly, some of the McAfee survey respondents plan to \"celebrate\" this coming Valentine's Day on social media.\n\nWhat does this mean, exactly? That when you \"poke\" someone on Facebook on Feb 14, you might face a paternity suit nine months later?\n\nThis is all very vexing. But who can take seriously the findings of McAfee on matters of the heart? It is a firm that combats viruses, but is powerless against the kind that tends to spread on Valentine's Day.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is about time governments and regulators in the region recognise this and seriously cater to this segment of the market\".\n\nThe region's largest low-cost carrier, started by Tony Fernandes and co-investors, has had its fair share of struggles on the infrastructure front. At its home base in Kuala Lumpur, the planned May 2014 completion of the new RM4 billion (S$1.5 billion) low-cost terminal, Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA2), has been delayed.\n\nMeanwhile, the airport crunch at its Indonesian operations has been worsening as more new players enter the business. The result has been a scramble for slots.\n\n\"LCCs need simple, functional and utilitarian airports,\" he said. \"We don't need 'Taj Mahals'. Just a 'kopitiam' (coffee shop) airport will do. If governments focus on this they can build five airports in secondary cities for every one massive prestige project they envisage.\"\n\nThe LCC currently operates about 165 single-aisle planes which fly to 92 destinations. Despite not having an air operators certificate (AOC) in Singapore, it operates 90 flights a day in and out of Changi via its Thai and Indonesian units.\n\nThe budget carrier could see its fleet grow to about 450 planes by 2024 when its aircraft orders are delivered.\n\nMeanwhile, other operators such as Indonesia's Lion Air, Singapore's Tigerair, Cebu Pacific of the Philippines and Garuda's Citilink are also growing their fleets.\n\nIn all, Asean alone has some two dozen LCCs, some operators with just a couple of planes now, with plans for more. AirAsia and Lion Air alone have 1,000 planes on order. LCC penetration ranges from as low as 5 per cent in Laos to as high as 56 per cent in Indonesia.\n\nIn Singapore it is 31 per cent, while penetration in Malaysia is 50 per cent.\n\nMr Raman also sees a major shortfall in aircrew developing across Asia: \"Some 190,000 pilots will be needed based on existing Asian aircraft orders over the next decade. The result could be a 30 per cent shortfall in pilots.\"\n\nHis solution: free up cross-border accreditations of pilots and aircrew.\n\n\"Asean governments should, identify about 12 to 15 flight academies and accredit them. Provide cross-border licensing. We need mobility in human capital in this region.\"\n\nAnd as Asean heads towards Open Skies next year, there will also be a need for harmonisation of routes, regulations and standards.\n\n\"We live in a part of the world where we are divided by large bodies of water. Governments need to make it easier and cheaper for people to move about. Let the market pick winners and losers. The money used to subsidise national carriers and dole out losers can be better spent on other priority projects.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It claims to be the first in the market to offer social media content search on multiple platforms - iOS, Android and the Web.\n\nIts locally developed offering, Kurrants, was launched in November to enable free searches of hashtags and text in different languages on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. It is expected to include photo and video searches as well as more sites such as Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest later this year.\n\nKurrants was conceived as a personal project in 2013 by Holatastic's co- founders Ian Poh, Jeff Au and Song Young. They wanted more out of social media search engines to satisfy their appetite for the latest news and updates on their pet topics.\n\n\"These days, you can get a pulse on what people are saying about practically anything by plugging into individual social network websites. But it can be a time-consuming, hit-and- miss affair digging for relevant content,\" said Mr Young, the company's marketing chief.\n\nAlso, social media search tools have their limitations, which include the lack of availability on multiple platforms and an inability to process multiple key words, noted Mr Poh, its CEO. He added that traditional search engines do not offer a comprehensive search and aggregation of content from different social media sites.\n\nWhile Kurrants lets users finetune their search by social media sites, it does not offer a public dashboard like Topsy, which shows the total number of tweets and sentiment score in a specific timeframe. Topsy also enables search results to be filtered by timeframe, links, photos and videos. According to Mr Au, there are plans to allow Kurrants users to further finetune their search results.\n\nHolatastic hopes to generate revenue by identifying trends on what people in specific locations search for, so as to help businesses better target customers.\n\n\"If you are a company and want to know what people are saying about your brand, you can engage a social media analytics company. But what about those who are searching for these posts? Finding out what people are searching for is as important as knowing what people are posting,\" said Mr Poh.\n\nHolatastic is also looking to provide social media content analytics in the future.\n\nThe six-person start-up is targeting the US and Singapore markets with plans to tap Indonesia and the Philippines at a later stage.\n\nAccording to Mr Poh, Holatastic has already garnered interest from fast- moving consumer goods companies, one of which is a local entity that is looking for a better understanding of its customers in the US.\n\nThe co-founders, who have ploughed over $20,000 into developing Kurrants, have set themselves some aggressive targets. They aim to raise at least $500,000 in funding this year in order to speed up development and boost marketing efforts to achieve 100,000 downloads of the Kurrants app by the end of this year. So far, there have been under 600 downloads of the Android app. The iOS version was made available only at the end of January.\n\nIn addition, they have set their sights on raking in $1.5 million in revenue by the end of 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/high-time", "site_title": "High time", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHigh time\n\nThis year's Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie kicked off with both gravity-defying innovations in the horological universe as well as the obverse - once sky-high luxury watch prices that are now more down-to-earth. By Chuang Peck Ming\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT was one of the two biggest annual watch shows on earth, and as expected, it was time to roll out the big guns. Which was exactly what nearly two-thirds of the 16 luxury brands taking part in the 2014 Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva did as they unveiled their newest, finest tourbillons - the ultimate test of a watchmaker's prowess.\n\nWhile these revered gravity-defying complications took centre stage at the show a fortnight ago, the grand complications, on the other hand, were noticeably absent. Sure, you can't produce a new multiple complication every year, but the lack of buzz created by the two new grand complications at last year's SIHH - A Lange & Sohne's Grand Complication and Audemars Piguet's Royal Oak Offshore Grande Complication - was almost palpable.\n\nJaeger-LeCoultre tried to save the day with the Master Ultra Thin Minute Repeater, which it claimed was the first ultra-slim grand complication ever created. But while impressive, the timepiece didn't quite live up to the traditional definition of a grand complication. It has only two complications - a tourbillon and a minute repeater (a mechanical watch that chimes the hours and often minutes at the push of a button) - just short of the minimum three criteria.\n\nAffordable luxury\n\nAs a result, there was no speculation of \"Which is the most expensive watch?\" this year. Grand complications cost millions. A Lange's Grand Complication (a combo of tourbillon, minute repeater, chronograph, perpetual calendar and moon phase) launched last year came with a $2.56 million price tag, the priciest watch at the 2013 SIHH. This year's most expensive watch was probably Greubel Forsey's Diamond-Set Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain, priced at 750,000 Swiss francs (about S$1.2 million) - a huge chunk of it goes to paying for the diamonds on the watch.\n\nSurprisingly, some of the brands were instead talking about lowering prices in 2014. This has been almost taboo in the past. Prices only go up but not down in the luxury watch market. Indeed, brands such as IWC and Roger Dubuis stuck to their guns and continued to raise prices.\n\n\"At IWC, we follow a reverse strategy, which is to upgrade our products and increase our average price, which we have done dramatically in the last couple of years,\" IWC president Georges Kern told JCK magazine. Prices of IWC's redesigned Aquatimer collection, the brand's focus in 2014, are up by 25 per cent on average.\n\nYet quite a few have broken ranks this year. Parmigiani Fleurier's chief executive Jean-Marc Jacot told The Business Times that the brand's new Metro collection, aimed at younger buyers, would be about 15 per cent cheaper than the 2013 novelties. Alain Zimmermann, CEO of Baume & Mercier, took pains to explain that his is still an \"affordable luxury\" brand selling watches mostly in the US$1,500-5,000 price range - though, ironically, its highlight this year is a US$57,000 flying tourbillon.\n\nEven Panerai announced it has brought the prices of watches driven by its in-house movements - which are more in demand than those with movements sourced elsewhere - down to more earthly levels, while Cartier's much-anticipated first diver's watch in steel is going for an accessible 5,500 euros.\n\nOffering more reasonable prices is key in Montblanc's strategy to reach out to a wider market under its new CEO Jerome Lambert. \"The overall strategy we are following is that we would like to share our passion for fine watchmaking,\" said Jens Henning Koch, Montblanc International's executive vice-president for marketing.\n\nThe brand's Meisterstuck Heritage watch collection, launched to mark the 90th anniversary of the brand's classic Meisterstuck pen, includes a perpetual calendar of exceptional high quality and specification. The complication is priced very competitively at 16,900 euros in red gold and 10,000 euros in steel.\n\nSpeaking of perpetual calendars - watches that self-correct for shorter months and the leap year - at least seven new models were seen at the 2014 SIHH: A Lange's Richard Lange Calendrier Perpetuel Terraluna and the Lange 1' Tourbillon Perpetual Calendar; Cartier's Rotonde Astrocalendaire; Greubel Forsey's Tourbillon Perpetual Calendar QP a Equation; IWC's Aquatimer Perpetual Calendar Digital Date-Month; Jaeger-LeCoultre's Master Grande Tradition Tourbillon Cylindrique a Quantieme Perpetual Watch; and Montblanc's Meisterstuck Heritage Perpetual Calendar.\n\nGreubel Forsey's creation is perhaps the most complex and intriguing, combining a unique perpetual calendar with an Equation of Time (the difference between the time shown by clocks and the time shown by sundials). Yet it's easy to read and use; though not necessarily easy to afford at 520,000-540,000 Swiss francs (around S$780,000).\n\nShowstoppers\n\nCartier's new perpetual calendar is interesting because it presents the day, date and month in a display depicting three concentric circles.\n\nOne of Cartier's more exquisite creations on display is the Ballon Bleu de Cartier Floral-Marquetry Parrot Watch, featuring a dial adorned with the image of a parrot intricately assembled from the delicate petals of flowers.\n\nThe Richard Lange perpetual calendar is impressively sophisticated, but it's the striking orbital moon-phase display seen through its sapphire-crystal caseback that steals the show.\n\nThere were innovations, but not of the breakthrough kind seen last year when Roger Dubuis wowed the watch world with the super accurate Excalibur Quatuor - thanks to a world's first silicon case and unusual four sprung balances. And Cartier, whose mystery clocks still amaze with hands that appear to float in rock crystal, unveiled a downsized version of it in a watch. What did the brands have to offer this year? Parmigiani presented an \"oversized\" date display - probably the world's biggest in a wristwatch - in a new minute repeater, the Toric Resonance 3. Piaget's perennial quest to produce ever thinner timepieces yielded the world's slimmest watch.\n\nThe surprise was it did it with a hand-wound timepiece, not an automatic watch which is its forte; ultra-thin hand-wound watches are the strong point of its rival Jaeger-LeCoultre which, before it was beaten this year, launched the world's thinnest hand-wound timepiece in 2013.\n\nThe watch that's technically - not necessarily in the innovative sense - most dazzling came unexpectedly from Van Cleef & Arpels, a brand better known for women's jewellery.\n\nThe watch, the Midnight Planetarium, is an astronomic complication that offers 24-hour time displayed by a comet. It shows the orbits of six of the solar system's planets correlated to an annual calendar. Its rotating bezel also allows you to set a lucky date.\n\nOne admirer was so taken by the watch that he offers this poetic description: \"This new piece reaches for no less than the heavens and returns to earth with the solar system that fits on a wrist.\"\n\nVan Cleef & Arpels\n\nThe brand famous for its jewellery appears to have outdone itself in the watchmaking department, producing the amazing astronomic complication Midnight Planetarium. It also unveiled the Pierre Arpels Heure D'Ici & Heure d' Ailleurs, a travelling timepiece that features jumping hours, retrograde minutes and a second jumping time zone.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of most of the participating brands' novelties at the 2014 SIHH:\n\nBaume & Mercier\n\nB&M has added a competitively priced retrograde and a chronograph to its successful Clifton line which debuted last year. Ironically, however, this year's talking piece for B&M, the purveyor of \"affordable luxury\", was the US$57,000 Clifton 1892 Flying Tourbillon, inspired by a B&M tourbillon which won a chronometry contest that year.\n\nA Lange & Sohne\n\nAs per last year, the brand's 1815 line continued to take centre stage. But the show's star was the Richard Lange Perpetual Calendar Terraluna. The white gold piece retails at 186,000 euros (S$319,000).\n\nAudemars Piguet\n\nThe spotlight this year was on the iconic Royal Oak collection, which has much of its rubber material replaced by ceramic. The standout piece was the Tourbillon Royal Oak Concept GMT, in which the movement's bridges are seen full-frontal in the shape of an hour glass where the dial should have been.\n\nRoger Dubuis\n\nAfter an exciting year that saw the launch of several innovative timepieces, the brand returned to its roots by producing the Homage collection of classically designed watches to pay tribute to its founder - and past watchmakers who had shaped him.\n\nMontblanc\n\nUnder a new boss, the brand more famous for pens is integrating its product lines to create more synergy. Thus Montblanc's new Meisterstuck Heritage watch collection is more than a celebration of the 90th anniversary of its iconic Meisterstuck pen. A perpetual calendar and a chronograph that also functions as a heart-beat meter are attractively priced, reflecting the new aggressive marketing strategy.\n\nIWC\n\nFor International Watch Co AG (IWC), a luxury watchmaking unit of Cie Financiere Richemont SA, in Geneva, Switzerland, this year marks the turn of IWC's Aquatimer collection of diving watches to bask in the limelight. And the piece that's probably had the most attention is the Aquatimer Chronographe Edition Charles Darwin (around $15,000), because it features a bronze case - a reminder of Panerai's very popular \"Bronzo\".\n\nGreubel Forsey\n\nThe tourbillon specialists, Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey, founders of Greubel Forsey watch brand, continued to branch out into other complications with the Tourbillon Perpetual Calendar QP a Equation, a tourbillon that also has a highly complicated perpetual calendar.\n\nParmigiani Fleurier\n\nThe target this year is younger customers with a busy schedule. And Parmigiani is hoping to hook them with its Metro collection of watches that are suitable for both formal and informal occasions. But it's not going commercial all the way. The Toric Resonance 3, a minute repeater with an \"oversized date\" is a reminder that the brand remains a serious watchmaker.\n\nCartier\n\nThe brand's versatility was on full display in 2014 when it launched five new in-house movements and a dazzling array of complications and artistic timepieces in Geneva. But for lasting impact, Cartier's Calibre Diver is most likely to be the most important in the latest collection. It's the brand's first diver watch and signals Cartier's entry into a key segment of the men's market, a market it has wanted so badly to penetrate.\n\nRichard Mille\n\nVacheron Constantin seems to have started a trend in 2013 when it dedicated the year to the ladies with a collection largely for women. RM has followed suit with colourful creations for the fairer sex that includes actresses such as Natalie Portman and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nJaeger-LeCoultre\n\nThe brand remains in the race to produce the slimmest timepieces, unveiling the Master Ultra-Thin Minute Repeater which it claims is the world's first ultra-thin grand complication. The Master Ultra-Thin 1907, another new piece, looked like a knock-off of last year's Master Ultra Thin Jubilee in platinum, but the latest version has a pink gold case and features a pricey enamel dial.\n\nOfficine Panerai\n\nChronographs and timepieces in Panerai's Luminor and Radiomir cases are the focus of the brand with a cult following this year. The limited-edition Radiomir 1940 Chronograph, in platinum and pink-and-white gold cases, were already sold out before they hit the stores.\n\nVacheron Constantin\n\nThe railway stations of the 19th century were the inspiration for the skeletal watches that dominate VC's collection this year. The handcrafted pieces, including the tonneau shaped Malte Tourbillon Openworked, are both a work of art and fine watchmaking at its best.\n\nPiaget\n\nPiaget's relentless pursuit of thinner watches hit pay dirt this year with the Altiplano 38 MM 900P (below), which at 3.65mm thick is thinner than Jaeger-LeCoultre's 4.05mm thick Master Ultra-Thin Jubilee. Piaget achieved the new level of slimness by integrating the watch's movement with its caseback.\n\npeckming@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was signed by Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew and the president of the Council of ICAO, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu.\n\nThis MOU provides the framework for collaboration between the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), the Singapore Aviation Academy (SAA) and the ICAO on leadership and management training for aviation professionals.\n\n\"(The MOU) represents Singapore's commitment to helping states increase their regulatory capabilities, such as in safety, as well as to promote the sharing of aviation knowledge and best practices,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nThis is the third training-related MOU signed between Singapore and the ICAO. The first one, on the Singapore-ICAO Developing Countries Training Programme, has seen more than 620 training fellowships and five scholarships awarded by the Singapore government for SAA courses.\n\nCurrently, an executive programme on aviation safety which is targeted at directors general of civil aviation is being developed. The inaugural programme is slated to take place in the later half of 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Each company will gain access to the other's patented technology and will explore \"future technology collaboration opportunities\", they said. The US International Trade Commission in Washington was scheduled to announce today whether it would issue an import ban on HTC devices.\n\nBoth Nokia and HTC have lost their lead positions in the mobile phone market. Patents will be one area of focus for Nokia after the former mobile-phone market leader agreed in September to sell its handset division to Microsoft Corp. HTC is counting on an updated version of its One smartphone, its first wearable device and a renewed focus on marketing to help turn around the company after two straight annual declines in revenue.\n\n\"The win could be a useful benchmark\" for Nokia, Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a note on Friday to clients. \"The win positions Nokia well in the ongoing arbitration with Samsung to monetise IP beyond standard essential patents and implementation patents.\" The settlement and the patent agreement with Nokia has no material adverse impact on the finances of HTC, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said in a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The two companies said that they have settled all pending patent litigation between them.\n\n\"The pact reduces one uncertainty for HTC,\" said Fu-li Chen, an analyst at Jih Sun Securities in Taipei. \"The deal was expected and may not have a big impact on HTC's finances.\"\n\nHTC is scheduled to hold an investor conference call today and release its January sales and first-quarter outlook statement.\n\nNokia, based at Espoo, Finland, was once the world's largest maker of mobile phones, only to see its title collapse as customers flocked to the design and technology advancements in Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc devices. Sales of HTC, once the leading smartphone maker in the US, dropped 30 per cent last year.\n\nNokia is selling its phone business to Microsoft, a deal that's expected to close this quarter, to focus on networking equipment. It has retained patents on fundamental phone technology as part of a programme to try and recoup the billions of dollars it spent on research.\n\n\"This agreement validates Nokia's implementation patents and enables us to focus on further licensing opportunities,\" Paul Melin, chief intellectual property officer at Nokia, said in the statement.\n\nAn ITC judge in September found that HTC infringed two Nokia patents for a way to remove errors in radio signals and a process to deal with different radio frequencies. No infringement was found of a third Nokia patent for a way to transmit data from a computer to a mobile phone, which Google Inc helped HTC challenge. It was directed at phones running on Google's Android operating system.\n\n\"Nokia has one of the most preeminent patent portfolios in the industry,\" HTC General Counsel Grace Lei said in the statement. -Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The cause of the software problem has not been determined, Mr Bhatnagar said, and the issue will be investigated by the aviation authorities in India.\n\nAir India said it had alerted Boeing and expected the situation to be resolved speedily. \"We have already raised this issue with Boeing, and they are taking the measures needed to ensure that the problem is solved and it does not happen in the future,\" Mr Bhatnagar said. \"Since it is a new machine for them as well, it takes time to adjust to new issues.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying it was aware of the situation and was \"working with Air India to provide support\". Boeing is upgrading the software in Air India's Dreamliners, but the aircraft involved in the emergency landing last week had not been upgraded, Mr Bhatnagar said.\n\nAfter noticing a \"software glitch\", Air India pilots diverted a Dreamliner that was flying from Melbourne, Australia, to New Delhi and performed an emergency landing in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"There was an indication in the flight management computers that there was a software glitch, so the pilot decided to land at the nearest airport, which was Kuala Lumpur,\" said Mr Bhatnagar.\n\nWhen Air India began its Boeing 787 fleet two years ago it was promoted as part of an effort to turn around the ailing airline. Air India has been a key customer of the Dreamliner and has ordered 27 of the aircraft. About a dozen of the jets are operating in its fleet. - NYT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its rivals are major domestic property players such as Vanke and Evergrande.\n\nMr Lim said CapitaLand has a pipeline of more than 60,000 residential units, having built more than 40,000 units for mass-market and high-end projects.\n\nLast month, CapitaLand secured a prime residential site in the city of Ningbo through its wholly-owned subsidiary CapitaLand China, and plans to build some 1,100 small and medium-sized units.\n\nChina is now the group's largest market outside Singapore. CapitaLand owns and manages 145 properties in 45 cities in China, worth more than 200 billion yuan (S$41.6 billion) in total.\n\nOn Sept 30, 2013, China accounted for 39 per cent or $14.2 billion of the group's total assets; the country also accounts for more than half of CapitaLand's global staff strength.\n\nThe group's unit CapitaMalls Asia has more than 60 shopping malls in China, with a total gross floor area of about 6.4 million square metres. It is registering double-digit net property income growth year-on-year, on the back of the growth in China's consumption demand.\n\nIts wholly-owned serviced-residence unit, The Ascott Limited, is also the largest international serviced-residence owner-cum- operator in China. Mr Lim said Ascott is looking to achieve its target of 12,000 apartment units in China by next year, by deepening its presence in first-tier and high-growth cities.\n\nCapitaLand Group chairman Ng Kee Choe said at the event yesterday: \"Besides focusing on our four core businesses - CapitaLand Singapore, CapitaLand China, our mall business, and serviced-residence business - we will nurture and develop our businesses in other geographies such as Australia, Vietnam, and also our Reit and fund-management platforms.\"\n\nTo celebrate this milestone year in China, CapitaLand has lined up events to be held all through 2014 across the country. A gala event will be held in Beijing later this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue fell 14 per cent to $69.3 million. This translated into a lower gross profit, due mainly to lower profit recognition of development projects, the property firm said.\n\n\"The successive cooling measures implemented by the Singapore government, in particular the introduction of Total Debt Servicing Ratio for housing loans by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, have dampened the demand for residential properties,\" it said.\n\nFor the nine months, revenue rose 3.3 per cent to $319 million. The overall increase in gross profit - up 3.8 per cent to $119 million - came from higher profit recognition in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.\n\nFinance income for the nine-month period dropped from $2.14 million to $143,000, due to the absence of mark-to-market gain on interest rate swaps. Income tax expense for the nine months also fell 6.7 per cent to $20.6 million, due mainly to an adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 for an underprovision of current tax in fiscal 2012.\n\nTaken together, net profit edged higher by 4.6 per cent to $93 million.\n\nShares of the property firm closed yesterday at $5.42, down three cents or 0.55 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSO you went all out with that multiple-carat diamond ring or the all-expenses-paid holiday for your other half last Valentine's Day, but there's only one problem: just how will you top that this year?\n\nDon't despair, hapless Romeo (or equally time-strapped Juliet). There are people who can handle this professionally - and help is just a phone call away.\n\n\"Cupid concierges\" are a growing business in countries such as the United States and concierge service operators in Singapore say they, too, are seeing more couples turn to them for some extra romancing on Valentine's Day. The demand is expected to further surge this year with Valentine's Day falling on the 15th day of the Chinese New Year, or yuan xiao jie, signifying double happiness for many.\n\nJames Eyton, the Asia Pacific CEO of LesConcierges, which partners with credit card company Visa to offer concierge services to its top cardholders, has seen a 60 per cent increase in requests for romantic activities from the Singapore market on an annual basis, with most requests coming in the week before Feb 14. Likewise, leading luxury concierge services provider Quintessentially Lifestyles has seen a 30 per cent jump in demand during Valentine's Day over the past four years.\n\nWhile most hotels offer ready-made Valentine's Day dining and staycation packages, top luxury names such as the St Regis Singapore, Pan Pacific and the Ritz-Carlton Millenia hotels all have in-house concierge services that up the pizzazz by pairing them with tailor-made full-day itineraries including spa experiences, sunset cruises and other outings around town. Flowers, restaurant meals, wedding proposals and trips to popular romantic destinations such as Bali are also common requests, say independent concierge service operators, though with growing affluence, customers are increasingly seeking private experiences in exclusive venues, such as truffle hunting in France or individual cooking classes with Michelin-starred chefs.\n\nOutsource the legwork\n\nHate shopping? Outsource the task to the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Hotel's in-house concierge services team, who can help you pick out jewellery and limited-edition shoes as gifts. Quintessentially's team once sourced a black crocodile Hermes Birkin bag worth $82,000 for a client, cutting its three-year waiting list to just three weeks.\n\n\"We've organised everything from a butler-serviced champagne dinner on top of an iceberg, to closing the Sydney Harbour bridge for a private proposal, and arranging a world-first opportunity for a couple to climb the Sydney Opera House and watch the New Year's Eve fireworks from the top of its 'sails',\" recounts Quintessentially's executive director, Caroline Lam.\n\nConcierge businesses say the voraciously growing demand stems from heightened expectations of the highly commercialised holiday, coupled with the increasingly time-starved modern lifestyles of high net worth individuals.\n\n\"Roses are always lovely, but sometimes a little cliched. Singaporeans are all becoming much more creative and expressive in how we show our softer side to our loved ones, but don't necessarily have the tools to arrange such things,\" says Andrew Long, CEO of Ten Group Asia Pacific.\n\nTrying to get seats at a sell-out restaurant at the last minute? Strong relationships between concierges and chefs could sometimes be your ticket in, says LesConcierges' Mr Eyton. \"The strength of the concierges is that we are part-assistant, part-detective and part-magician.\"\n\nIndeed, Aspire Lifestyle's most unusual request was from a customer in Singapore who wanted to send flowers to his girlfriend in Japan, but she would only give him a photo of the front gate of her house, and the longitude and latitude of the place, recalls Andrew Quake, general manager of its Singapore office. His team eventually managed to locate her to send the flowers over, after some sleuthing. Though requests can take hours to days to pull off, depending on their complexity, Aspire's current record is a grand total of 40 minutes. \"A customer from Singapore called at 8am, as he wanted a cup of hot latte delivered to his girlfriend in Seoul just before 9am when she would step into the office. Eventually, we tapped on our network and our consultants in Seoul managed to get it done successfully,\" adds Mr Quake.\n\nRequests for Valentine's Day activities are typically from males, say concierge businesses, though there is equal demand from married and unmarried individuals.\n\nSome concierge services such as Quintessentially charge an annual membership fee of $7,700 for unlimited requests, while others work based on commission from their service partners, so customers pay only for third-party costs incurred per request. Prices can start from a few dollars for a bouquet of flowers to US$250,000 for a private charter of a yacht for an idyllic one-week sojourn that LesConcierges once organised.\n\nAnd though Valentine's Day scrooges may say that leaving it all in the hands of a \"cupid concierge\" may reek of insincerity, most concierges - of course - disagree.\n\n\"Most people have no problems engaging a wedding planner to ensure their wedding turns out perfectly. No one would ever think that the man or woman lacks sincerity in this case. The same mindset should apply to cupid concierges as well,\" retorts Aspire's Mr Quake.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net profit for the quarter was not disclosed.\n\nFor the full year, gross premium written rose 4.8 per cent to $109.5 million, driven by increased business in the corporate and reinsurance sectors. Net profit was $27.4 million, down 6.1 per cent from a year ago, due to lower commission income and lower net earned premium.\n\nA 12-cent final dividend and 2-cent special dividend was declared, unchanged from a year ago. Together with the interim dividend of 3 cents paid last year, the total dividend paid for 2013 was 17 cents a share - a dividend yield of 3.9 per cent based on UOI's last traded price of $4.40 a share.\n\n\"Given the constraints of a highly mature and competitive market, it has become more and more difficult for an insurer domestically to maintain let alone widen its underwriting profit margin,\" the company said yesterday. Underwriting profit margin for 2013 was 13.4 per cent, down from 18.3 per cent in 2012.\n\nNet asset value per share was $4.59 at end-2013, compared to $4.29 at end-2012.\n\nUOI said that higher claims and operating costs will continue to create problems for it. \"As such, the operating environment in 2014 is likely to remain challenging. Regionally, the frequency and quantum of claims could rise with unpredictable and extreme weather conditions.\"\n\nBut positive underwriting results can be expected with \"continued maintenance of its judicious underwriting policy\". UOI added, however, that investment income will remain volatile due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This includes 60 per cent of the world's top aerospace firms, while 30 per cent of the companies participating are new to the Singapore Airshow altogether.\n\nThe 40,000 square metres of indoor exhibition space and 100,000 sq m of outdoor display area at Changi Exhibition Centre were sold out ahead of the event, with four companies - including ST Engineering and Rolls Royce - building double-storey exhibition booths indoors to boost their size.\n\nThe Singapore Airshow (Feb 11-16) attracts more delegations than any other airshow worldwide, with over 250 official delegations and some 45,000 to 50,000 trade visitors expected this year.\n\n\"Singapore Airshow is one of the few multi-faceted events in the region that combine both military and commercial aviation in one strategic location,\" said Jimmy Lau, managing director of organiser Experia Events. \"It consistently attracts corporate budgets which draw high-level corporate individuals and quality visitors.\"\n\nLittle wonder, since the International Air Transport Association (Iata) expects that traffic within the Asia-Pacific will represent 31.7 per cent of passengers worldwide by 2017, while Boeing projects the number of planes in the region will nearly triple to 14,750 by 2032.\n\nThe biennial event will also see its biggest contingent from the US thus far, consisting of US government officials as well as over 160 US firms.\n\n\"It really is the convergence of opportunities here in the region and how our companies have been playing in this region for decades,\" said United States ambassador to Singapore, Kirk Wagar at a press briefing yesterday morning.\n\nAt the same time, Asia's largest airshow comes hot on the heels of the Dubai Airshow in November, where the US$200 billion or so order tally was largely bankrolled by cash-rich Gulf carriers inking blockbuster deals for high-value aircraft, including Boeing's 777X.\n\nBut Mr Lau stressed that the Singapore Airshow is not \"chasing numbers\".\n\nHe added: \"The Middle East starts from a very low base. Asia Pacific has 5,000 aircraft already, with two dozen or more airlines operating here. It's almost a mature market and it's a replacement market. They acquire new aircraft (which are) very tactical to the routes they're going. In the Middle East, they've found the need to quickly boost their connectivity.\"\n\nMr Lau had said previously that orders at the Singapore Airshow 2014 are unlikely to match the US$31 billion or so seen in 2012, which was largely lifted by a whopping US$22 billion deal that Indonesia's Lion Air signed with Boeing.\n\nSome 90 commercial, military and executive aircraft will be on display this week, including Boeing's Dreamliner and Airbus' new wide-body A350 - which launch customer Qatar Airways will receive in 4Q 14 - as the world's two biggest planemakers race to secure new orders from fast-growing regional carriers. One of Airbus' most notable product launches since the double-decker A380, the twin-engine A350 will be on static display from Feb 11-12 and will also take part in a flying display.\n\nAccording to Flightglobal's advisory service Ascend, Garuda and state-carrier Philippine Airlines are mulling over the A350 and B787 as they look to phase out the Airbus A330, while Malaysia Airlines may replace some B777-200ERs.\n\nSingapore's Defence Ministry had said last month that it was still in talks with the US with regard to a potential deal to upgrade its fleet of 60 F-16 fighter jets, some of which have been in service for over 15 years.\n\nMeanwhile, reports suggest Boeing could announce a US$3.9 billion order for 38 single-aisle B737-MAX planes from India's SpiceJet at the Singapore Airshow, while Thailand's Nok Airlines is also expected to ink a deal for the US planemaker's popular B737-MAX model. Vietnam's budget carrier VietJetAir is reportedly close to confirming part of a US$9 billion order for up to 92 Airbus planes.\n\nExecutive jets - such as Bombardier's Challenger 605 - and military aircraft, such as Boeing's AH-6i helicopter, will also be on display.\n\nFrost & Sullivan's director of aerospace and defence practice (Asia Pacific) Subhranshu Sekhar Das notes that while all eyes are typically glued to the dollar value attached to the overall haul sealed at airshows, the event also serves other equally important purposes such as bringing together aviation firms, organisations and key decision-makers to discuss appropriate policies for the region and the broader industry.\n\nThis could include the ongoing march towards carbon neutral growth, efforts to beef up infrastructure in under-developed markets or establishing open skies agreements.\n\nOver the years, the Singapore Airshow has evolved by better optimising infrastructure, raising the quality of the conferences centred around the event and delivering an\n\never-expanding list of high-calibre delegates and exhibitors, Mr Das pointed out.\n\nConferences taking place today include the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit and the Asia Pacific Security Conference. These will feature ministers and prominent industry stalwarts such as Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) council president Dr Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, Iata chief Tony Tyler and Siim Kallas, vice-president of the European Commission.\n\nPeripheral activities being held at Seletar Aerospace Park in conjunction with the Airshow include the launches of Pratt & Whitney's new centre for engine maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) and Airbus and Satair's service centre as well as the opening of Bombardier's first wholly-owned service centre in the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due to the impairment of an Australian mortgage-backed security.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $7.4 million, up from $6.3 million a year ago, due to increased interest and dividend income.\n\nFor the full year, revenue was $35.9 million, almost double the $18.4 million a year ago. This was due to the one-off sale of two Boeing 757-200 aircraft, higher gains from the sale of listed equities and higher interest income, partially reduced by the loss of rental income from the aircraft after the sale.\n\nNet profit was $28.8 million, up 51 per cent.\n\nA final dividend of 1.5 cents a share was declared. This works out to a yield of 9.3 per cent from GIL's closing price of 16.2 cents.\n\nGIL is the former Babcock & Brown Structured Finance Fund, and is run by ST Asset Management, a Temasek Holdings unit.\n\nIts portfolio at end-2013 was mostly made up of loans and securitised assets, listed equities and bonds. Just 3 per cent was held in operating lease assets, and 4 per cent in cash.\n\nThe fund said the near-term outlook for equities is expected to be volatile because of worries over the earlier-than-expected cutting back of bond purchases by the US Federal Reserve, as well as the economic slowdown and financial sector problems in China.\n\nThe outlook for credit is muted now that the Fed has started tapering its bond purchases. \"Possible headwinds include a possible rise in US Treasury yield, currency volatility as well as political uncertainty in many countries.\"\n\nIn 2013, GIL invested the full amount of $48.5 million raised in a rights issue into global bonds, listed equities and collateralised loan obligation securities. GIL said it will continue managing its assets to protect and grow value. It will be selective in the current environment, and \"focus on fundamental bottom-up analysis, with preference for assets with defensive characteristics, and good cashflow generating ability\".\n\nNet asset value per share at end-2013 was 22.6 cents a share, compared with 23 cents at end-2012. Return on equity was 12.5 per cent in 2013 versus 11.2 per cent in 2012.\n\nThe counter closed unchanged at 16.2 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWE walked briskly through several streets of shops and crossed the grand, multi-laned La Avenida 9 de Julio - one of Buenos Aires's most historically significant boulevards named in honour of Argentina's Independence Day - before we hit a stretch of Jacaranda trees in full bloom.\n\nBut we couldn't stop for an Instagram moment - not when we were on a mission to change money. We had just 10 minutes before the money changer closed on Palermo, the city's poshest shopping street. \"It's not so near your hotel, but they're a reliable place to change money,\" recommended our travel agent from the company Say Hueque, cautioning us against changing notes with the touts in the central district's Calle Florida. They openly shout out \"Cambio! Cambio!\" at you, but tourists have blogged about fake Argentinian pesos, or getting robbed down the road after they've done your exchange.\n\nWe thought we were going to a regular money exchange - you know, like the glass-and-grilled boxes in our shopping malls and office buildings - even though we were told this was the \"black market\" exchange. \"Surely they just mean a money exchange on the street rather than the bank right?\" Or so we thought.\n\nIt turned out that we were going to get an introduction to our most valuable resource in Buenos Aires, just down the street where the Park Hyatt and Four Seasons Hotels are. It took some serious asking around, before a convenience store owner who was pulling down the shutters to his shop indicated to the sign-less office right in front of his shop.\n\n\"That one?\" we asked, puzzled. We stood in front of that office, where the entire glass facade had been covered from wall to ceiling with an opaque wallpaper, and all it had was a doorbell. So with nothing to lose, but feeling a bit stupid, we pressed it.\n\nA buzzing sound indicated that we could push the door open, and we entered this empty room with two chairs and a couch, with two men inside. It could be the waiting room of a doctor's office, except that travel posters adorned the walls and no society magazines were lying around. We got into the queue, behind the guy with a Four Seasons hotel uniform, and soon it was our turn to go through another buzzing door for the hallowed hall of the black market exchange. There we got a whopping 10 Argentinian pesos to a dollar, when the official rate was only five. (Since then, the peso has slid sharply against the dollar, following the Argentine government's ease of foreign currency controls last month.)\n\nOur first encounter with the black, or blue (after the flag), market turned out to be one of most memorable adventures in this otherwise sophisticated South American country - with a bustling capital which has an overwhelmingly European style in architecture and culture.\n\nTravel articles rarely highlight it, but the way to enjoy Argentina is with cash, and if you changed US dollars in the black market, you get way more bang for your buck. Buenos Aires - with its wide Parisian-styled boulevards and laid-back Spanish pace of life - is an old soul with a hip feel. But for a taste of the whole country, Mendoza, Iguazu Falls and Bariloche also need to be added to your itinerary.\n\nThere's a step-back-in-time feel to Argentina, and the sense of faded - but well-preserved - glory is especially strong in Buenos Aires. But even Argentina isn't impervious to the new world order as it has opened its doors to mainland Chinese - who run the supermarkets in the country, especially in Chinatown (Barrio Chino) at Belgrano.\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nEven if you don't know much about Argentine history, you'd have some kind of impression of its tempestuous political legacy through the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Evita. Eva Peron still features quite significantly in the city's consciousness - as one can tell from her large wire mural gracing the Public Works Building on Avenida 9 de Julio.\n\nOne of the must-dos is, of course, a tour of Casa Rosada (the Red House) and to look out from the balcony where Eva Peron once made her famous speeches. The house is still functioning as the Argentine President's office, but amazingly, it's open to tourists on the weekend for guided tours. Other iconic sights to visit in Buenos Aires include the historic Teatro Colon which now conducts tours daily.\n\nThe weekend too is a time when La Boca comes alive - with live tango music bouncing off the colourfully painted corrugated iron walls of the buildings and football paraphernalia dominating the shops. This is where much of your camera's memory space will be taken up with the colourful buildings and life-sized papier mache figures - especially of Diego Maradona and the everyday Italian immigrants who founded this neighbourhood.\n\nSundays are great for shopping - especially if you're into antiques and vintage ware. The historic San Telmo, which is just about a 15-minute walk from the revamped Puerto Madero - the Clarke Quay of the city - is turned into a long street market with arts and crafts as well as antiques for sale. The colonial-style houses on cobblestone lanes and the art deco designs on traditional cafes make it a picturesque experience. An ice-cream soda in Buenos Aires will most likely be served as ice cream and syrup in a mug, with carbonated water in a traditional spritzer bottle on the side.\n\nTwo must-visit neighbourhoods are Recoleta and Palermo Soho. Recoleta is where the \"old money\" is - a refined neighbourhood with leafy boulevards and French-style townhouses and buildings. The famous Recoleta Cemetery is a must - if not to see Eva Peron's tomb and for the beautiful art deco designs of many of the mausoleums, and to witness the rather macabre tradition of exposed coffins.\n\nAnd finally, for fashion shopping, Palermo Soho is the hip hub with streets and streets of cafes and trendy shops, followed by large branded outlets in Alto Palermo. Buenos Aires also has a happening indie design scene, and you're bound to come across shops retailing collectives of local designer brands. Shopping in Argentina is about as good as it gets in South America, rivalled probably only by Brazil.\n\nIguazu Falls\n\nThe 80m high Cataratas del Iguazu is spectacular, but even better is the marvellous boardwalk built right at the falls' edges. Visitors get so close to the water you're soaked by the spray and mist. Those of a certain vintage will, of course, remember the seminal film, The Mission, about the early Jesuit missionary activity in the area. One could opt for a day tour of the preserved Jesuit ruins. The falls were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1984, and this addition to the New Seven Wonders of Nature also forms the border between Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina.\n\nThe falls and its national park is shared between Argentinia and Brazil, and although the Argentinian town is smaller, it is purportedly a safer town to stay in. There are lots of parrillas (BBQ restaurants) around, serving wood-fired Argentian steaks, good pastas and pizzas.\n\nMendoza\n\nMendoza looks like an Australian town, think Melbourne, and it is all about the wine and good food. The region has over 2,000 wineries producing over 6,000 labels. One of the most stunning wineries to visit is the Dutch-owned Salentein winery in Uco Valley, which has a glorious setting, an art gallery and a grand piano in its wine cellar. The drive there is also a scenic one, and a bit further off the beaten track.\n\nWhen you get to Mendoza, there are a number of agencies offering wine tours or you could always rent a bike with a map, and cycle to all the various wineries near Mendoza. Just note that the prettier countryside and wineries are further from town. There are more excellent restaurants in Mendoza and the wineries than you have mealtimes to try them all.\n\nPlaces to dine in Buenos Aires\n\nI Latina\n\nMurillo 725, Villa Crespo,\n\nBuenos Aires 1414\n\nilatinabuenosaires.com/en/\n\nWHAT we call private dining in Asia is known as closed door restaurants in Argentina, and topping that list now is I Latina - a restaurant operated by three Colombian siblings. Camilo and Laura Macias manage the service, while Santiago is the talent in the kitchen. I Latina opened in Buenos Aires in 2012, after about 10 years in Bariloche, a resort town in the southern part of the country.\n\nWhat \"closed door\" means is that dinners are by booking only, but otherwise it's a full-fledged restaurant, housed in an elegant building and imbued with warm, cozy colours in its furnishings and art.\n\nThe restaurant doesn't have an a la carte menu - only a seven-course degustation. While the food in South America on the whole is on the bland side, with little spices or chilli used, I Latina really gave us what we imagined to be more exciting Latin American and tropical flavours.\n\nIn fact, this was the only place where sour, sweet and spicy flavours co-existed in one dish, such as the tamarind-covered confit duck, caramelised prawns with spicy pineapple and a coconut-infused, fruity ceviche. The crispy octopus was paired with a thick Peruvian soup (thick) with enough fire in it to taste like Japanese curry. The coffee-braised pork was most excellent - a richer and more luxurious version of our coffee ribs in Asia. The best is that the meal ends with an espresso cup of cinnamon-infused Colombian coffee, which is a real perk given the less-than-stellar coffee you'll find served throughout Argentina. The degustation menu, with one bottle of wine, came up to about $85 per person.\n\nChila\n\nAlicia Moreau de Justo 1160\n\nPuerto Madero, Buenos Aires\n\nwww.chilaweb.com.ar\n\nCHILA proudly showcases Argentine products from all over the country, and on our visit, the seasonal items featured goatling from Mendoza and black hake from the Antarctic, besides algae from Tierra del Fuego. Chef Soledad Nardelli is extremely talented, and this rare female chef has helmed the restaurant since it opened in 2006. Meats are perfectly roasted and there's a balanced use of herbs and spices, with deeply flavoured broths. The excellent cuts of dry-aged beef is the hallmark of Argentinian beef, especially when they're done to order. The goatling featured a whopping piece of tender meat, while the black hake was infused with saffron and served with a basil sauce. Chila is located at upmarket Puerto Madero, with the port waters reflecting the lights from the swanky apartments and commercial buildings on the opposite side.\n\nLa Cabrera\n\nJose Cabrera 5217 y 5099\n\nPalermo Viejo\n\nwww.parrillalacabrera.com.ar\n\nIN Argentina, the cuisine is also dominated by the cattle industry and the large Italian immigrant community. Here is the best place to eat Italian in the continent, Argentinians are the world's top carnivores, consuming an average of 137 pounds of beef (bifa) a person a year. With 600gm steaks averaging US$13 each, it's a no-brainer that steak is a staple - for tourists at least - but there's also Patagonian lamb, and Italian pasta.\n\nHaving a steak at a traditional parilla is a must, and La Cabrera is the pinnacle of that experience. Besides the highly rated steaks, it's a place which serves a number of sides to go with the steaks - like tapenade, a smooth potato mash with Dijon mustard, garlic cloves in red wine, apple sauce, tartar sauce, salad or pickled eggplants. The fun is in guessing what you're eating.\n\nSince the standard serving is 600gms, all we could manage that night was a rich and smooth Kobe beef (at the princely sum of S$50 for 800gms) shared between the three of us. Diners should also check the board for the specials of the day, as they include special prices.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hopes-positive-us-jobs-report-help-rein-earlier-loss", "site_title": "Hopes of positive US jobs report help rein in earlier loss", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHopes of positive US jobs report help rein in earlier loss\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT was a tale of two halves this week - the first half saw the Straits Times Index extend its losses from the previous week as emerging market (EM) worries took hold, and the second saw a rebound as short sellers covered their positions and as Wall Street placed a positive bet on Friday's US payroll numbers.\n\nThe first half's selling was perhaps to be expected given the jitters which have surrounded EMs for several months. The rebound was arguably also to be expected - traders cannot remain short for too long and the signs on Wall Street in the middle of the week were that the selling there was drying up, so short-covering on Thursday and Friday was always on the cards.\n\nThe three banks, SingTel and the Jardine group led the index below the 3,000 mark to the 2014 closing low of 2,960 on Wednesday. The rebounds on Thursday and Friday - which were also led by the banks, SingTel and the Jardine group - enabled the index to cut its loss for the week to 14 points or 0.5 per cent. In yesterday's session, the index gained 24.87 to end at 3,013.14.\n\nExcluding US dollar and HK dollar trades, the value of all trades marked as short sales on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday were $268 million, $273 million and $184.5 million, respectively. These may not necessarily reflect outstanding positions at the end of each day as they could have been squared off. On these days, the most heavily shorted stocks were SingTel and the three banks.\n\nAmong the blue chips to release results this week was Singapore Airlines. It reported a 65 per cent drop in third quarter profit after tax and minority interests (Patmi) to $50 million due to one-off items that totalled $126.6 million.\n\nOCBC Investment Research said that excluding these items, the adjusted Patmi would have increased 12.9 per cent to $160.9 million, which is in line with its expectations.\n\n\"While softening jet fuel prices may alleviate cost concerns, yield pressure will continue to haunt SIA,\" said the broker. \"We maintain our fair value of $9.50 but upgrade SIA to HOLD on valuation grounds.\" SIA slipped six cents to $9.44 with two million traded.\n\nThursday's rebound on Wall Street - after the market there had dived 2 per cent on Monday following the release of a weak manufacturing report - came after the US Labor Department published its latest jobless claims report which showed a drop in claims for unemployment benefits. This in turn gave rise to hopes that Friday's payroll numbers would be strong and restore confidence in the economic recovery.\n\nIn its Daily Breakfast Spread yesterday, DBS Group Research said it agreed with the consensus view that 180,000 new jobs were added in the US for January.\n\n\"Even if consensus is correct at 180k, that's not a good number and it's not an improvement in the broader sense of the word,\" said DBS.\n\n\"One hundred eighty thousand payrolls would still leave 3-month average payrolls at 165k. That's 17k less than in six months ago in June 2013. It would leave 6-month average payrolls at 185k - lousy in its own right and 10k less than the 195k registered in June of last year. Everyone, including DBS, expects January payrolls will be back to normal. That doesn't mean good. And it doesn't mean things are getting better.\"\n\nElsewhere, Pictet Asset Management strategist Luca Paolini in his February Barometer said that although China slowdown concerns and Fed tapering worries have hit EMs, it is worth noting that EM underperformance versus their developed market peers stretches back to 2010, when global economic growth began to slow and the profitability of companies in the developing world started to lag.\n\n\"Seen through this lens, the shift in US monetary policy and the turbulence in economies such as Argentina and Ukraine have merely reinforced what has been a longer-term trend,\" said Mr Paolini.\n\n\"However, we think the pattern of relative underperformance - which has widened the discount on emerging-to-developed market stocks to 30 per cent on a price-earnings basis - is now at odds with fundamentals. Our indicators suggest many markets are oversold while investor sentiment has worsened to an extent that limits the scope for a further market correction.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How likely is it that your industry or profession will still be around and relevant by then?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 9, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nJoe Poon\n\nPresident\n\nXchanging\n\nIN 50 years' time, the world will at once be a smaller and bigger place. Technology will continue to further reduce the tyranny of distance, accessibility, language and other barriers, making it a smaller place. At the same time, technology will further enable people and communities of all walks and persuasion to better realise their potential and reach opportunities hitherto inaccessible and not invented yet.\n\nIn 50 years' time, the world will also at once be totally unrecognisable and yet governed by the same themes. Innovation will continue Schumpeter's constant wave of creative destruction. New entrants will continue to replace today's Fortune 500 leaders by doing things differently, just as today's champions had replaced their predecessors. In 50 years' time, themes that have guided mankind's progress, and the same ones that underpin Singapore's progress, will still decide the winners and losers. The two most important are an openness/adaptability to innovation and change, and the insistence of transparency and integrity - where talent and resources can have the best chance to be applied to the best returns.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B Icag Pte Ltd\n\nTECHNOLOGY and scientific advancements will play a bigger role in the way society and the economy function in 50 years' time. Society and the economy will be even more dependent on technology, through a plethora of smarter devices, more intelligent appliances and more user-friendly applications, consistent with today's trends. We will rely more on technology in the way we live, work and play. For all the new benefits which technology brings, it will become more ubiquitous.\n\nFor example, in the area of healthcare, scientific advancements will enable people to live longer. I think there will be more centenarians in the next 50 years. Mobile, active and intelligent micro-chips can be implanted in our bodies to detect ailments, ''repair'' malfunctioning organs and perhaps even help grow new organs, through stem cell technologies, to replace diseased ones. People will likely have more leisure time, as a result of better health management and longevity. Both society and the economy will have to adjust to this new development, not only to tap new opportunities but also to ensure that they have the right strategies in place to pursue them.\n\nTechnology will inevitably lead to faster communications and shorter decision-making cycles. Businesses will need to be more responsive to customer needs and demands, which will change at a much faster rate than today. The world will shrink further in the next half-decade. If there is one development that will scuttle progress in 50 years' time, it would be that the world has not done enough to protect Gaia. I hate to think of the damages which climatic change, especially the warming of the earth, can inflict upon our world. More industries and professions will need to pay greater attention now to protecting the environment and improving sustainability, if they hope to survive and thrive in the next 50 years.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nChief Executive Officer / Founder\n\nMHC Asia Group of Companies\n\nFIFTY years ago when Dick Tracy sported his ''smart-watch'', it was ''science fiction''; today we have more processing power in our iPhones than was needed to fly man to the moon. The future practice of medicine will be both exciting and scary.\n\nExciting, because of the emerging innovations that promise to improve healthcare delivery and provide us with longer, better-quality lives. I imagine cancer will have a cure; paralytics will walk again due to stem cell technology; amputees and organ failure patients can 3D-print their body and organ parts in the lab.\n\nScary, because will we still have doctors and nurses, or will they be replaced by robots which are immune to human error? Whichever way we turn, we need to accept with humility that life is not fully in our control. Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, reminds that as a doctor we ''cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always''. Even with the best technologies, machines should never completely replace the caring touch of humans.\n\nTeo Lay Lim\n\nSenior Managing Director\n\nAccenture, Asean\n\nOUR world is evolving to be one in which the boundaries of the physical and the digital will become increasingly blurred. From retail to healthcare, from banking to education, the way we all work and live will be significantly transformed by hyper-connected, intelligent ecosystems.\n\nDigitally enabled healthcare will improve practitioner productivity and patient experience throughout the life-cycle of care. Digital banks will become widespread and digital money transfer will become the standard way to make international transfers. Brick-and-mortar retail establishments will blend the digital with the physical, deploying technology such as augmented reality to optimise retail real-estate and connect customers. Biometrics will enable cities to become safer. Students can access education anywhere, any time.\n\nDigital manufacturing will become widespread with technologies such as 3D printing and crowd platforms to further abate time and space barriers between producers and consumers. Smart sensors will enable efficient use of resources and more integrated ''smart'' urban services, and machine-to-machine interactions will make concepts such as driverless cars a reality. Wearable technology will make technology less obvious, less intrusive and always on, always close by.\n\nThere is no time like the present to prepare for this digital future - where innovation can take place not only in the creation of products and technologies but also in the application and configuration of these technologies and data-driven insights to evolve new business models - and organisations and governments have the opportunity to define their digital destinies.\n\nLim Tit Meng\n\nChief Executive\n\nScience Centre Singapore\n\nWE live in challenging times, buffeted by climate change, an ageing population and intensified urbanisation, which have been further compounded by declining birth rates and limited natural resources for sustainable energy, water and food supply. To keep us going as a human race globally, and as a nation locally, innovative solutions through science and technology will be of prime importance. A knowledge-based economy will continue to grow and provide us with smart technologies and creative means to meet healthcare, productivity, transport and communications, food security, energy and water consumption needs. Translating outputs from research and development work of scientists and engineers, coupled with sensible socio-economical and international relationship policies, will be an engine we cannot afford to shut down.\n\nScience Centres worldwide will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting science literacy, bringing about awareness of issues and advancements and communicating science to the public so as to bridge the widening knowledge gap between the learned and the learners.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nFIFTY years from now, Singapore could quite easily be an Asian version of Geneva from a political and financial perspective. Our banking systems, laws and infrastructure are the envy of most nations. Geographically we are perfectly positioned to become the global gateway to South-east Asia. We boast a multi-racial tolerance and relative impartiality.\n\nSingapore's excellent education system is, however, a double-edged sword for the future. With education comes a natural drop in total fertility rate. We are at the bottom of the global chart on total fertility rates and action is required. More women choose career over family; the cost of living in Singapore creates a financial and family planning dichotomy; a woman's salary is a major contribution to the household income. Singapore is getting older and therefore for our ''next 50-year survival'' we must encourage a baby boom. If we cannot, then we must recognise that immigration is the key to our survival and so must lay plans to encourage and attract young, high-quality, educated immigrants.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nWITH the meteoric advancement of medicine and the conscientious practice of good lifestyle habits, there is a good chance that I may live to see the world 50 years later. The economy and society in general will be driven by more advanced technologies eliminating the need of human intervention and participation, allowing us to do the things we most enjoy. Unfortunately, I do not see everyone enjoying the same benefits brought forth by this advancement.\n\nI envisage a world 50 years from now, further divided by a gaping wealth gap that is slowly but indubitably creating social difficulties in the world. Such huge disparities will lead to the amplifying of the Gini index, resulting in a deep rupture of the social fabric and a world thrown into pandemonium. People will also be more detached and individualistic as face-to-face communication is abandoned in favour of more advanced forms of media. Humans will hide behind machines. Emotions will also be detached from our daily decisions and activities. Despite all the technological advances, sad to say, the world may become colder, more distant, less caring, less empathising and definitely less fun.\n\nI believe in 50 years, our business would be able to stand the test of time and rapid innovation - as specialists in logistics and heavy haulage transportation, we will continue to be an important element of the economy as infrastructure and buildings will still be needed as more people congregate in densely populated cities. But there will be major consolidation of service providers as those who fail to innovate and create efficiency will be eliminated or be acquired. Thus we strive to continuously innovate and break new borders. It may seem like I hold a grim vision of the future. But I sincerely believe that the future can also bring great promise, if we start to emphasise more ''humanity'' in our technological creations and enhance the redistribution of wealth and resources.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nTHE world in 50 years' time will be a very different place spurred by Asia's growing influence in the global economy, scientific breakthroughs and geo-political changes. Technological advances will make transport and logistics easier by blurring boundaries and opening doors for developmental projects across sectors. Population growth will further fuel the need for construction on the commercial and residential fronts. Consequently, projects are bound to become costlier and more complex in terms of scope, degree of risk, and the political, cultural and social factors involved.\n\nOrganisations will radically change their approaches to stay on track through better leadership programmes and use of lead methodologies to have a firm grip on project controls and implementations. Project management will hence be a core competence and will go beyond traditional technical capabilities. It will enter a more strategic stage, with managers expected to demonstrate business acumen in their project leadership roles. To help evolve and develop these skill-sets, project management education will be critical and more relevant than ever.\n\nJoshua Soh\n\nManaging Director for Singapore and Brunei\n\nCisco\n\nWE see in popular movies and books today, the future is either one of bright promise - where humanity's challenges are solved by technology and greater enlightenment - or a dystopian world where today's issues have only gotten worse and the very survival of mankind is at risk.\n\nI have an optimistic view of the future we actively create. Within 10 years, there will be 50 billion connected things in the world, with trillions of connections among them. These connections will change the world for the better in ways we may not think possible today. It's not just the ''Internet of Things'' that is making all of this real - it's the Internet of Everything, the networked connection of people, process, data, and things. And analytics brings the intelligence to all to these connections and helps us make smarter decisions.\n\nSingapore in 2064 will be the beacon of connectivity, where technology and innovation meet, with a positive impact on the economy. I envision a future where sensors and machine-to-machine communication will impact every part of our lives - whether that means improving how we move from Changi to Jurong or Singapore to San Jose; having an energy-efficient connected abode or primary healthcare delivered to our homes.\n\nIn this connected Internet of Everything economy, skills to work with the technologies that enable and analyse this connectivity will be vital. At Cisco, we believe education and the Internet are the two great equalisers in life, and we will continue to bring industry-relevant curricula into the schools, polytechnics, ITEs and universities to ensure a future-ready workforce. Welcome to tomorrow.\n\nJack Yang\n\nPresident\n\nHTC South Asia\n\nWE are expecting convergence of global economies within the next 50 years as we are discovering new forms of resources on earth, new clean and renewable energy. The future will be an exciting place where vehicles are self-driven, drones take care of everyday simple tasks, and data information is centralised for the benefit of citizens.\n\nThe basic fundamental of life is communication. In the future, communications will be instantaneous and seamless with immediate access to all types of information and technology at our fingertips. The world will become a better place, thanks to more efficient communications through wearable and embedded technology. We envision technology in an organic form, using nano technology - imagine a mobile communicator membrane that can be powered directly from our bodies.\n\nBased on today's technological leaps in innovation, mobile convergence is imminent and it's clear that technology will be the key driver in future society. HTC will be a big part of this as we are the technology leader.\n\nSoon Ong\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nClarity Group\n\nFOR over 35 years, Clarity has championed the future of smart homes and businesses. We have brought smart solutions to over 3,000 homes and our continued investments and focus on bringing futuristic experiences to life place us in a brilliant position to help consumers and businesses evolve and keep pace with game-changers in the next 50 years.\n\nOur economic activities have evolved from being transactional to experiential. The next 50 years will only be more experiential for consumers and businesses. From 3D technology to holographic displays, the possibilities for the technology industry will be endless as result of digitalisation, artificial intelligence and true-to-life content reproduction.\n\nPicture yourself living in a fully automated world. When you return from a long day of work, the air-conditioning switches on the moment you step home and your favourite music begins to play, all without you having to lift a finger. This would have been unheard of a decade ago, but at Clarity, we have made these advances become reality. We believe that regular everyday items will continue to undergo a massive technology makeover to make way for smarter homes and businesses in the next 50 years.\n\nThese trends present exciting opportunities for Clarity, our experienced architects, our group of companies and most importantly, our consumers.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nGIVEN the rate of urbanisation and globalisation today, the global economy and various societies are going to become even more intertwined in 50 years' time. With rising affluence overall, more people will have access to advanced technology and be more connected to one another via these devices (whether they be improved versions of our current smartphones, tablets and computers, or technology yet to be invented). In the development of technologies, engineers and those with special technical skills will be needed more than ever. The specialist recruitment of technical and engineering professions will be a sunrise industry that may grow out of its niche space into the mainstream.\n\nIn addition, technology will change the way people interface, and therefore recruitment companies in general will have to go beyond the mere sourcing and placing of talents. Rather, their mandate will need to encompass guiding individuals through the lifespan of their careers and tapping into the technology of the day.\n\nMark Billington\n\nRegional Director - South East Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nI HAVE no doubt the accountancy profession will be more relevant than ever in 50 years. Businesses will always need financial expertise and advice, which is what the accountancy profession provides. Business is becoming increasingly more global, which means increased demand for financial management and transparency. I believe we will also see greater demand for audit and assurance services - not just of numbers but of other areas of reporting. For example, as the global population rises, it is likely natural resource use will become more important and demand will grow for greater transparency around measuring and reporting this.\n\nAs a global financial hub in a growing region of the world, Singapore will continue to require financial and business skills and it is likely that more highly-qualified finance professionals will be needed. One area where we can expect to see significant change is an ageing workforce, and people will likely need to work beyond the current retirement age. This means that workplaces will have to culturally adapt to a maturing workforce, in terms of employee requirements and ensuring skills are in step with the modern world.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nTHE world will seem a lot smaller and closer as the inter-connectivities between people and institutions remove barriers such as geography and information, faster than ever. Much of this, driven by the pace of technological advancement, is already playing out today.\n\nAt LinkedIn, we have started to work towards our vision of creating the world's first economic graph, by digitally representing the global economy. We believe this will create economic opportunities for all professionals. By identifying the connections between people, jobs, skills, companies and knowledge, the graph will enable professionals to identify and realise opportunities - from getting the jobs they want, to closing the skills gap in certain parts of the world and raising capital for growth.\n\nAs we build our economic graph, all forms of capital - from human to financial - will start to flow where and when it is needed, helping to bring the world even closer together.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL advances, especially in information communications and artificial intelligence, will continue unabated and profoundly impact the way we live and work. For example, increasing automation of routine work processes and heightened information flow will result in industries and economies being powered by jobs that require higher analytical skills and professional judgment. These changes to the economic and business landscapes will bring about new challenges and opportunities.\n\nTo remain relevant, accounting professionals will need to continually adapt, learn new skills and provide value in keeping pace with fast-changing developments. I am confident that the profession will do so, just as it has adeptly done in the past to address and serve evolving business needs. For example, from simple book-keeping, its function has grown to include areas like treasury, tax and risk management.\n\nNonetheless, what remain constant in a sea of change are the core tenets of accountancy ingrained in the DNA of all accountants, ethics and integrity. These values will remain relevant and vital to all business needs and will support Singapore's reputation and growth as a thriving financial, business and accountancy hub.\n\nGeorge Chang\n\nVP, Southeast Asia & Hong Kong\n\nFortinet\n\nFIFTY years is a long time. Just as today's Singapore today is unrecognisable from the one our parents knew in 1965, it's impossible to accurately predict the scenarios that our children will face in half a century. Going by recent developments, however, the world is likely to become a thoroughly connected place. Everyone will be able to communicate with everyone else, instantaneously and over multiple platforms. The volume and speed of information flow will be unprecedented.\n\nOne thing, however, will not change - our need for privacy. The immense amount of data being exchanged will need to be secured against prying eyes and unintended recipients, and for this reason, I foresee the IT security industry will continue to thrive. Today, cyber attacks are already becoming more plentiful and sophisticated. As the number of devices - not just for communications but also household and office appliances, as well as medical devices like pacemakers - in the world grow in the coming years, malicious hackings will rise exponentially and these will need to be curbed.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nIN 50 years' time, the gap between today's developed and emerging markets would have narrowed, and the world will be multi-polar with different centres of economic power co-existing, collaborating and competing. Most economies will face intensified urban and social infrastructural challenges, as population growth, demographic shifts and resource scarcity impact governments and businesses. Accelerated innovation and technological advances will radically redefine the way we do and regulate businesses and harness talent. New types of jobs will be created as others become obsolete.\n\nProfessional services firms like EY will continue to play an integral role, as we envisage a better working world in the future, where there is trust and and confidence in capital markets, businesses grow sustainably, employment rises, consumers spend and governments invest in their citizens. The caveat is that we must continually transform - in terms of human capital, broad capabilities, deep expertise, insightfulness and being client account-centric - so as to stay relevant.\n\nLeon Perera\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nSpire Research & Consulting Group\n\nHOUSEHOLD robots will revolutionise personal services as well as household work, helping a much older workforce to remain productive for far longer. Space or near-space travel will revolutionise long-distance transport and accelerate globalisation (hopefully without creating a new arena for military conflict). 3D printing of small batches coupled with big data analytics will enable a degree of product customisation unimaginable today. Extremely stringent green and ethics regulations will shift resources away from simply making and consuming more stuff towards making everything greener, safer and fairer.\n\nResearch-based consulting will be around for the foreseeable future - it makes more sense for firms to outsource the business of deeply understanding the external environment to experts in research methodology. But highly structured, traditional research will become commoditised or in-sourced. What will remain relevant is multi-disciplinary research that delves beyond customer self-report data to uncover deep pockets of unmet needs and hence opportunity.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nPwC has identified five megatrends which will shape the world in the coming years: demographic shifts, shifts in global economic power, accelerating urbanisation, resource scarcity and climate change, and technological breakthroughs. I believe these five trends will greatly impact how we grow and develop as a nation. Being a relatively open economy, it is imperative for Singapore to embrace change, anticipate the impact of these megatrends and continue to re-invent ourselves so that we are well-positioned to secure our future success in the next 50 years.\n\nFrom current trends, it is quite clear that in the next 50 years, the middle class in this region will continue to grow, thus increasing wealth and spending power in Asia. South-east Asia is also likely to continue to develop rapidly as an emerging market. I am confident that with the right talents and strategic innovations to adapt to the changing landscape, the professional services industry in Singapore will continue to grow and stay relevant. The industry should leverage on these global trends to provide the right innovative solutions to important issues affecting business arising from these mega shifts.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWE can look forward to new technologies, new ideas and a far more dynamic future. As a market leader, Adecco enjoys looking into the future and seeing how the recruitment/talent industry could look years from now. We can draw on history and past experience to prepare ourselves for yet more change. When it comes to managing talent and matching talent within companies, HR professionals will have to think out of the box - of innovative and creative ways to attract the best talent.\n\nToday, there are far more women in the workforce as compared to two decades ago, which is a good thing and a trend that will likely continue. We also expect to see mature and older workers playing an even more important role in Singapore's workforce. As developing economies develop further, so will the increased expectations of both job seekers and hiring companies. Organisations will need to offer employee benefits other than compensation to attract top talent. Undoubtedly there will be increased global connectivity via social media platforms and job-seekers will connect in new and different ways.\n\nMarcel van Doremaele\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nRabobank International, Singapore\n\nIN 50 years, Asia will be home to 56 per cent of the global population, and 66 per cent of the global middle class. With a world population of over nine billion in 2050, they will not only consume more, but demand more varied and higher-quality food products. We expect a greater demand for agricultural commodities and for global food production to double.\n\nWhile land expansion would be able to alleviate some of the global demand, we expect it to be limited. Even with the right soil and climate, enabling factors such as access to capital, political stability and infrastructure are required to use land to its full potential. There is then a need for food producers, governments, companies and consumers to work alongside to overcome the physical challenges.\n\nAs the world's leading food & agribusiness bank, Rabobank brings its own expertise to play, acknowledging that responsibility for sustainable food production needs to be shared between farmers, processors, retailers, traders, consumers, governments, academics - and banks.\n\nSharat Sinha\n\nVice-President Asia Pacific\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nWE are already seeing the trend of many services going digital today - from banks offering services through mobile to enterprises storing their data on the cloud. This trend will only continue, and in 50 years' time, it's likely that more of the devices that people use in everyday life will come online.\n\nThis will no doubt be an innovative step for society, but will also mean that the risks of cybercrime and data theft will increase as a result. Cybercriminals will always try to be two steps ahead and will continue to find ways to exploit the network. I would expect that security technology will keep pace with the threats to make sure that the connected world stays safe. While we cannot be 100 per cent resolute on where the cybersecurity industry will be 50 years from now, we are confident that cybersecurity will evolve to become even more sophisticated as service providers, enterprises and governments continue to collaborate to combat cybercrimes.\n\nAdam Judd\n\nVice-President for Asia Pacific\n\nBrocade\n\nIN the mid-2060s, I envision a society that is interconnected, not only between people, but also with its surroundings, as the next wave of consumerisation is driven by artificially intelligent technology.\n\nFrom driverless cars to automatic health scans, a world where everyday objects are smart and can automatically carry out actions according to people's needs is fast becoming a reality. An interconnected society will translate into high economic interdependence between countries as virtual currency demand starts to phase out existing currencies. Businesses and industries will rise and fall based on their ability to adapt to the changing technology infrastructures and ways of operating business. The networking industry, which is where Brocade's heritage lies, will be the heartbeat of technological change over the next 50 years as it develops the infrastructure for our interconnected world.\n\nPrakash Mallya\n\nCountry Manager\n\nIntel Singapore and Malaysia\n\nACCORDING to Gartner, by 2020 the Internet of Things will create US$1.9 trillion of economic value-add and over 30 billion connected devices will be in use. Along with this increase in connected devices comes a plethora of Big Data. If this is the case in six years, imagine what it will be like in 50 years!\n\nCompanies will then face the challenge of knowing what to do with this data and how to best leverage it. More and more companies are realising that mining Big Data can give companies a significant business advantage and can help them better understand their customers to provide them with the products and services they want and need.\n\nIntel has been, and will continue to, develop innovative products and technologies that will help power the era of the Internet of Things and enable the Big Data economy. In Singapore, we have already started by opening the Big Data Innovation Center in Singapore in 2013 and this is only the beginning.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nOVER the last 50 years, the supermarket and retail industry has grown in scale, diversity in retail formats and increasing sophistication. Going forward, I am confident the industry will continue to evolve and remain vibrant. Retail therapy is a form of relaxation for many of us, and I see more people taking up cooking as a hobby too. So I remain optimistic on the prospects for the industry.\n\nAt Fairprice, we will continue to transform and innovate in terms of both services and offerings. We will as before harness technology to enhance productivity while enriching customers' shopping experience. From introducing barcoding in the early 90s to contactless payment last year; and just this year, we launched the Scan2Go system - a self-scanning technology for customers, and another first in the industry. Our online shopping portal, FairPrice Online, with some 100,000 subscribers, has also been growing in tandem with the popularity of online shopping. No doubt online shopping will gain in importance as a complementary form of supermarketing - a space we intend to lead as well.\n\nLance Tay\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore\n\nIN the next 50 years, we anticipate that the global life insurance industry will face challenges including ageing population, changing customer behaviours and other economic and political factors. Technological advances in medical care will improve the survival rate for illnesses like cancer, but these treatments will come at a price. Those who can afford to pay for these advanced treatments may live even longer.\n\nWe will witness the shift towards an informed, ageing population, with a rise in demand for retirement income products, long-term care products and longevity insurance. Ultimately, innovative products, service and delivery will hold the key in catering to these changing needs. Hence, insurers who can anticipate and plan for change can mould the future.\n\nCommitted to anticipating changes and staying ahead of the curve, we will continue to deliver more innovative solutions for society's future insurance needs.\n\nJessica Tan\n\nManaging Director\n\nMicrosoft Singapore\n\nTHE next 50 years could be really exciting, yet daunting at the same time. We will need to support a world population that will exceed nine billion, with double the number of people over 60 years old. In addition, more than two thirds of jobs in the future simply do not exist today.\n\nIf we look at how technology has progressed in the last 50 years, I believe that it will be more relevant than ever. Technology will play an even bigger role in enabling opportunities, overcoming these challenges, bridging gaps and in shaping the way we live, work and play.\n\nTo build a future where we strive to be better, faster and provide value, the seeds of tomorrow's technology breakthroughs have to be planted today. As a people-focused technology company, Microsoft has made that important first step many years ago. We have committed and invested in numerous initiatives that will prepare our youths to acquire skills that will help them stay relevant in the future; encourage the use of technology to enable innovative methods of teaching and learning so that we can also address the needs of the next generation of digital natives to become savvy citizens and leaders of the future, and we continue to drive programmes that will help the under-served, senior citizens and people with disabilities, to bridge the digital divide and to be active members of society.\n\nDumont Jean-Michel\n\nChairman\n\nRuder Finn Asia\n\nTHE last 50 years has seen revolutionary changes in how people communicate, share information and interact with political and corporate leaders and each other. With the advent of social media and the speed at which information and commentary is disseminated, consumers can access and react to messages at a level unheard of just 10 years ago. Fifty years from now, the rate at which news will be picked up or go viral will be instantaneous and, because of this, targeted communication and precise messaging will remain crucial.\n\nPublic relations is about creating, building and sustaining trust among stakeholders, including the public. In 50 years, learning how to best craft and share messages in the most effective manner will have evolved into an art form. PR professionals will be required to make messages resonate in a world where the lifespan of news stories and the public attention span will almost certainly be shorter than it is today.\n\nPinaki Rath\n\nManaging Director\n\nGold Matrix Resources Pte Ltd\n\nTHE next 50 years is always exciting - this adage stands true whether we are in 2014, 1914 or even 2104. I would think that peak hour traffic will be greatly reduced as more and more people start working from their homes. There would be more emphasis on individual merit and getting teams to work together will be a challenge. The concept of leaders in the traditional sense will diminish and those who can use technology and digital networking better than others will be the future leaders - the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates ilk.\n\nProduct obsolescence and substitution will be so rampant that I am not sure if Gold Matrix can survive in its present form. In fact, it may not even survive as an outfit if it can't adapt to the changes brought forth by rapid technological obsolescence. Product life-cycles will be extremely short; there's also miniaturisation and green technology. The world will use less resources and be far more efficient. We would need to manage machine intelligence and get a grip on a common digital network that will transform the economy - that's how I reckon we shall hope to remain in any business 50 years hence.\n\nSandeep Bagaria\n\nCEO\n\nTagit\n\nADVANCES in technology around mobility means that as a society, we are more connected than ever before. We see monumental changes on the horizon for the economy resulting from mobility, which is already giving rise to new industries. The emergence of mobile money in 83 countries is quickly changing the way that people make payments. With new payment intermediaries, new currencies like airtime and digital exchanges, businesses and even individuals are now able to offer services and collect payments via mobile devices. In addition, mobile technology is also giving a high proportion of the world's unbanked people access to financial services, via their mobile devices.\n\nThe implications of this trend for the economy will be huge, and while it is difficult to know where the economy, and indeed the world, will be in 50 years' time, as more enterprises make the decision to go mobile, we expect our industry to continue to thrive.\n\nAng Shih-Huei\n\nPartner and CEO - Asia\n\nBell Pottinger\n\nIT seems evident that Singapore will have an even richer convergence of cultures in 50 years' time. The cultural fabric of Singaporean society will be more diverse, yet likely harmonised and tolerant, as the population thinks globally. Singapore will benefit from the continued growth of Asian economies and the collective growth of Asean in economy and power.\n\nAs Asean shifts towards a more business-inclusive policy landscape, companies will need to know how to engage a wider stakeholder base. They will also need to adapt to faster-paced and diversified channels of communication, and the court of public opinion will become a vital factor for success. Already, the importance of public relations is increasingly becoming a critical discussion at the top levels of corporate governance throughout Asia. Companies will view well-managed strategic communications as key to their success in coming decades.\n\nRiaz Mehta\n\nPresident and Founder\n\nImagine Group\n\nIN 50 years' time, the present theory of six degrees of separation will probably shrink to two or fewer degrees of separation. The world is now an interconnected neural network. This power of connection has far exceeded anyone's imagination and will continue to break boundaries.\n\nWe are in the content industry (producing TV shows) and I believe in 50 years' time, content will remain king, so to speak. But people will have complete freedom in how, when and where they absorb this content. Viewers will be able to control the direction of the story, which will be personalised to suit the consumer. And of course, content will be multi-dimensional and experiential, that is, you can not just watch the content, but you can smell it, feel it and participate in it!\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE progress that Singapore has made from independence to its current status as a First World country - within the span of just one generation - is truly remarkable. Due to its small size, Singapore is especially vulnerable to outside forces. Yet, we have also demonstrated the ability to realise achievements against the odds. It is thus hard to predict what the next 50 years holds for the republic. Singapore is going through a major transition period and reinvention will be the name of the game in ensuring we maintain our competitive advantage and continue to prosper for the next 50 years. The world, too, is changing dramatically due to the advances in technology and what is almost guaranteed is that technology will change the way we live. 3D printing, for example, will create a new world of possibilities and Singapore ought to position itself at the vanguard of this technological wave.\n\nPrimeStaff's core service is supplying manpower to other businesses. As the world shifts towards the use of automation to increase productivity coupled with a reduced reliance on manpower, it is possible that the demand for recruitment services may eventually shrink in 50 years' time. I believe the industry will still be relevant, as the need for human workers will not be completely eradicated. However, what may change is that demand for manpower may shift towards more ''high-value'' and specialised roles as we become an even more knowledge- and technology-led economy.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nSingapore Head\n\nACCA\n\nACCORDING to findings in a recent joint report between ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) entitled ''100 drivers of change for the global accountancy profession'', the overriding global themes for the next 50 years are those of shifts in regional wealth and power, extreme economic uncertainty and political transitions.\n\nThe business landscape will be reshaped by a combination of market volatility, globalisation and transformational innovation. Continued globalisation will take place against a backdrop of persistent economic turbulence and uncertainty and growing pressure to rethink the entire global economic and financial governance infrastructure.\n\nThe digitisation of business and everyday life will be characterised by our growing personal technology ecosystems, the ease of access to the Internet and social media and their impact on attention spans. For business, in particular, the impact of cloud computing, the valuation of digital assets, cybersecurity, the rise of ''big data'' and the value of data mining will be emphasised.\n\nAttention will also be drawn to the disruptive potential of new industries and production models, and developments such as digital publishing, intelligent accounting systems, predictive analytics and augmented and virtual reality. Emerging areas of science such as genetics, personalised healthcare, brain science, robotics and nanotechnology will also have significant business and commercial impact in the next 50 years.\n\nImpacted by these megatrends, the global and local accountancy profession will need to strengthen its public image and go beyond current financial reporting practices to provide a more transparent, simplified but holistic picture of a firm's health and prospects. The profession must continue to adopt intelligent tools that can analyse and interpret large volumes of data rapidly that will transform activities such as audit and forensic accounting. The ability to master these developments will be the key differentiator between success and failure in the exciting future ahead.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman / Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nFIFTY years later - I think by then people will recognise only cities rather than countries. With technology advancing rapidly, the world will be better connected, virtually and physically with sophisticated transport systems. Maybe we will have trains from Singapore to Beijing or London or South Africa or even the North Pole! When there is technological advancement, there will be improvement in societies with people enjoying a higher standard of living. With better lives, the direct selling industry will grow. From there, Best World will celebrate her 75th anniversary with our members from all over the world!\n\nRaman Singh\n\nRegional Managing Director - Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East and Africa\n\nMundipharma\n\nTHE next 50 years is an opportunity for Mundipharma to help further alleviate the increasing Burden Of Pain, not just in the local markets we serve but globally. The official statistics are staggering: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the number of people diagnosed with cancer in the world each year has leaped to more than 14 million. WHO predicts the number of cancer cases will reach 24 million a year by 2035 amid rapid lifestyle changes even in the developing world. There will also be greater public health concerns as a result of population growth, urbanisation, rising energy consumption and pollution.\n\nWith the growing numbers of cancer patients and other chronic pain sufferers, we see it as Mundipharma's responsibility to continue to improve the quality of lives globally. As the world goes through rapid change, we will work tirelessly to provide patients with easier access to new and innovative treatments so that they may enjoy a better quality of life.\n\nRanjit Khanna\n\nHead of South East Asia & Global NRI\n\nCoutts & Co Ltd\n\nIT will not be too far-fetched to imagine that in 50 years, we will have a world that - as a result of a myriad new technologies in reverse and forward osmosis or in water treatment, for instance - has clear fresh water flowing freely instead of a shortfall of fresh water supplies because of population growth and increasing urbanisation and industrialisation. Or a world where inexpensive, abundant, universal and low-carbon power, in everything from micro-devices to major power stations, replaces the traditional forms of energy, and oil is no longer so dominant. This could have profound implications for the global energy market, for oil prices and, potentially, for geopolitics in the Middle East and Russia. Or even a world where advances in cancer management and regenerative medicine see changes in life expectancy and transform our assumptions about retirement planning, financial management and investment.\n\nThe future in 50 years such as this has tremendous implications for us all, and it would also have a huge impact on our clients and their wealth, and correspondingly for the private wealth management industry. To remain relevant to our clients, we would need to show that we are prepared for some of these eventualities that might have an impact on our collective future and that we are ready to explore the possible implications of changes in the world on clients, their families and the businesses they own and run. Only if we do that will we have the credibility to continue advising our clients in the years to come.\n\nTom Zack\n\nPresident South-east Asia\n\nEMC\n\nAMID the global economic outlook, Asia continues on its upward trajectory with analysts forecasting Asean, India and China to be among the possible ''future states'' of the global economic and business environment.\n\nFor businesses, the hyper-connected world brings hyper-accelerated innovation. To achieve business priorities and increase their competitiveness, companies will continue to look at the adoption of new-generation technologies and innovations which can support their needs and at the same time improve business performance, productivity and efficiencies.\n\nHarnessing the potential of a high growth market, EMC will continue to operate from a position of strength while empowering businesses with the right technologies, infrastructure and innovations, enabling the move to the third platform. EMC will continue to evolve to meet the needs of a hyper-connected world by enabling the software defined enterprise through best of breed storage platforms, software defined storage and converged infrastructure.\n\nAs we move into the future, organisations should continue to take informed risks and reap the benefits of what technology can bring - an agile environment, an efficient workforce and improved business performance - enabling the move to the third platform and transforming the way we work and live.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nTHE world in 50 years seems like light years away now, but in reality it will arrive and when it does, it will be a force to be reckoned with. Singapore and her people are most certainly ready for a new age society and economy - look at how far we have come in the last four decades or so. In 50 years the biggest power will be the astonishing scale of technological growth. We will see technology revolutionise the way we work, play and interact. It will completely transform how we think and react to key issues in our lives and environments.\n\nHuman relations will change, and the way we do business will depend on how progressive we are technologically. The most serious threats will also come up in the maelstrom of instability that lurks within the technology. Most of the world currently still treats technology as a want and not a necessity. There needs to be continuous education about the power and reach of technology to our young. Early childhood education will be one such avenue to impart this knowledge; any entity that enables the progress of a nation by educating its young will continue to have significance. Fast forward 50 years and I foresee a society and economy that is more vibrant, complicated and demanding of its citizenry.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nAT today's time-compressed pace, 50 years is a long time to gaze into. Singapore rises to become a First World nation torn away from Federal Malaysia and almost could not survive. It took Japan less than 50 years to rise from its ashes after World War II to become the second largest economy after US, but it has now slipped into No 3, after China.\n\nIn 50 years, I see a changed migratory pattern where the movement of people will reverse from the West to Asia. The Middle Kingdom will become once again the Middle Kingdom of the world, where people worldwide converge at. China may become the No 1 economic power sooner than later as it overtakes the fiscal-stricken US.\n\nSingapore needs to be plugged integrally into the Middle Kingdom and play to the reversal of roles and fortunes of the US and Europe. We are far too small but we can become an integral part of the supply chains of finances, commodities, people, trades between China and Asia and between Asia and the rest of the world.\n\nIf we are not careful, in 50 years, Singapore can disappear and become a short and forgettable miracle. Singapore must continue in our drive to evolve and remain relevant in a changing geopolitical and economic landscape.\n\nJulie Tay\n\nVice-President, Asia-Pacific\n\nAlign Technology, Inc\n\nCOUNTRIES around the world will be more interdependent than ever before - an inevitable trend that will be compounded by advances in connectivity, digitalisation, and the ever-rising volume of global trade and consumption.\n\nSince its inception, Align Technology has always set the bar for leadership and change by constantly innovating to bring new and better solutions to the market. We advanced clear aligner orthodontics through the use of cutting-edge software and 3D printing for Invisalign. And, our iTero digital scanner has brought about marked benefits, including improved accuracy, treatment efficiency, and enhanced patient experience.\n\nToday, Invisalign is offered in more than 60 countries and has been used to treat over 2.5 million patients worldwide. By staying focused and invested in the next breakthrough in digital dentistry, Align will be optimally positioned to lead the sector, to bring healthy, beautiful smiles to patients, and to foster practice growth for our dental partners.\n\nLiu Chunlin\n\nCEO\n\nK&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd\n\nTHE global issue that will be everybody's concern in the next 50 years will be the relationship between China and the US. China's GDP is expected to be larger than that of the US by then. The relationship between these two big powers is crucial to the global economy. If the two nations work hand-in-hand with each other, a bright outlook can be expected. Prosperity will prevail, and power struggle between the two minimised. As for Singapore, growth in an economy led by a strong government could be expected. But the voting citizens need to be more careful in future elections by looking into the long-term interests of the country and not just the short-term personal enjoyments. It is crucial to make the correct choice of who should lead the nation in the next 50 years in order to keep sailing in the right direction.\n\nThe security & protective solution industry which we belong to exists to counter terrorism. Since the 911 attacks in 2001, the terrorism threat has grown - and is unlikely to abate in the next 50 years as regional, religious and social tensions lead to continual conflicts around the world. As such, demand for security services will not subside. As the terrorists become more sophisticated with better understanding of technology, our industry will certainly need to constantly update and upgrade ourselves to effectively counter the threat. Our industry will remain a booming one in the next 50 years.\n\nChua Weng Foo\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nUnit4 Asia Pacific\n\nFUTURISTS are envisioning some exciting and at times frightening predictions for the future of technology that will either enhance or replace activities and products that we hold dearly. Fifty years from now, there will be new ways of consuming and processing of data, resulting in the increasing need to leverage on this data to make real-time intelligent decisions.\n\nOne aspect of our industry - enterprise resource planning (ERP) - has always been regarded as a reactive application where you extract information when you need it. The challenge, however, is to transform the ERP concept into a more intelligent and proactive partner that offers information to users before he or she knows they need it. Adapting to the new generation is especially key in listening and keeping our pulse on the industry and our customers. While technology will definitely change with time, we expect our core values of catering to dynamic organisations and our principle of delivering change-embracing solutions to remain a strength in this industry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Feb 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWILD caught, hormone-free and homemade. Long before these became trendy catchphrases tagged onto restaurant menus, Pioneer Seafood was already well ahead of the pack. That's because Lee Choon Huat, the 75-year-old proprietor of the 35-year-old Chinese restaurant in Tuas has his roots deep in the fish trade. Having lived in the area since its days as a sleepy fisherman's village, he swears by only eating - and serving - the freshest catch daily, because that's what he's used to.\n\n\"Ours was the only Chinese family in a Malay kampung of fishermen. My brothers and I helped out with my mother's fish trading business, so we would gather near the jetty at the (now-defunct) Tanjong Kling beach to buy the daily catch from the fishermen and then transport it to the central fish market at Boat Quay for auction,\" he reminisces.\n\nSubsequently, he helped out with the catching of fish as well, sailing out to Indonesian waters to fish every evening and returning only at daybreak the following day. \"My favourite moment was always watching the sky slowly brighten as we were driving back to Singapore. We always drove towards the light - that's how we would find our direction home,\" he muses. Though the Tuas of today is more dusty industrial enclave than the seaside idyll etched in Mr Lee's childhood memories, the rapid modernisation of the area has not prompted him to up and go.\n\nAfter a brief four-year relocation to Jurong Point mall in 2008, he decided to move back in July last year into a larger, 450-seater space within the Tuas Amenity Centre.\n\nReturn of signature dishes\n\nLongtime customers of Mr Lee will cheer the return of signature dishes such as the prawn fillet with macadamia nuts coated with a golden orange sauce, or the baby squids stuffed with a homemade XO sauce so addictive that you can even request to buy it home by the jar. There are circa 2014 updates on the menu, too. The Teochew yam paste is entirely lard-free, with additions of Thai pumpkin and water chestnut mixed in instead for extra flavour dimensions.\n\n\"Tuas is a good place to be. Most of the big multinational corporations are here, they have the spending power and they need a place to entertain at lunch. If you open in the heartlands, you only get traffic on weekends,\" he explains. Private dining rooms with karaoke facilities on the second floor cater to the corporate crowd.\n\nBut the main attraction in moving back, he says, is that he now has a piece of real estate to call his own. \"I bought these premises, so I don't have to worry about landlords raising my rent when I'm doing well. Back then, labour cost in Singapore would take up 20 per cent of your operating cost. These days, it's 30 to 35 per cent. So if your rent is high too, then what profit margin is there left?\"\n\nDespite the increasingly inclement climate of the restaurant scene here, \"if young people want to start a restaurant, I won't tell them not to do it\", he says. \"They should still try, but they have to survey the market even more closely.\"\n\nHe should know. He made the switch from fish trading to poultry farming in his early adulthood, by watching and learning from the Australian owners of a chicken farm he worked in as a teen, and later grew his own multi-million dollar business catering to a gap he sensed in the market for halal poultry.\n\nIn 1954, he set up his own business, Lee Brothers Poultry with his younger brother and they grew from door-to-door egg vendors to the owners of Singapore's largest chicken processing plant. As one of the few farms to offer halal chicken back then, the business grew voraciously on the back of demand from offshore markets such as the Middle East.\n\nIn its heyday, companies such as SATS Catering, Cold Storage and Brand's were among his customers.\n\nThe chicken business was wound up in the 1980s, shortly after they started the restaurant, and Mr Lee's younger brother died two years ago. He now oversees the business alone.\n\nThe two most important factors for staying the distance, he believes, lie in knowing one's product, and learning how to cook. \"Even if you're not going to be the chef, learn the basics. And learn how to cook the hard way, don't take short cuts,\" he offers.\n\nFor even little tweaks in the kitchen can result in large overall savings for the business. Instead of throwing away fish bones, one can use them to make soup, for instance. \"Big organisations, especially, have high wastage, and that drives up prices for consumers in turn,\" he says.\n\nBut it isn't just about the dollars and cents. \"If you compete on price alone, there will be no end to price slashing. At the end of the day, you won't make any profits. It all comes down to quality and giving people good value that they want to come back for.\"\n\nYou'd think a man of his age would want to slow down to ride things out smoothly into the sunset, but Mr Lee has got bigger plans up his sleeves.\n\nIf all goes well, he hopes to expand with further outlets in the Jurong area. \"We have to build a foundation first. Once that is built, I'll see if I can convince my children to take over the business,\" says the father of two sons and a daughter, all in their 50s. His older son is in property sales, while the younger son and daughter run a balloon design company.\n\n\"Running a restaurant requires long hours, especially weekends. But they want to run their own business, so I let them try that first.\"\n\nThen with a cheeky grin brimming with youthful optimism, he adds: \"But I'm sure I can at least convince one.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Gurinder's nephews, Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh, also control the extensive healthcare and financial services businesses respectively under Fortis Healthcare (the sponsor of Religare Health Trust) and Religare Enterprises.\n\nSGX's query concerned the connections between RSSB, RHT and Fortis Healthcare.\n\nIn response, Mr Mehrotra said that while the parties mentioned are related by kinship, none of them is a member of the executive body of RSSB that manages its day-to-day functions, nor do they receive distributions or otherwise profit from RSSB. Mr Gurinder, the spiritual head of RSSB, is a member of its general body, but he and his immediate family, as defined by SGX's listing manual, do not have any interest in RSSB, as defined by the Companies Act.\n\nThe various relationships were also disclosed to the trustee-manager's board when the transaction in question was discussed.\n\nRHT's acquisition of the Mohali clinic from RSSB was done \"on an arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms\", said Mr Mehrotra.\n\nThis arm's length negotiation had taken into account, among other things, an independent valuation report by the India office of real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield, which valued the clinic at 2.76 billion rupees (S$56.3 million).\n\nRHT had also agreed to acquire the clinic from RSSB at a lower price of 2.7 billion rupees, Mr Mehrotra pointed out.\n\nHe added that RHT CEO Gurpreet Singh Dhillon had disclosed the relationships between the various parties when the transaction was put up to the trustee-manager's board - comprising a majority of independent directors - for approval.\n\n\"The decision to proceed with the transaction was made then by the board of directors with knowledge of the above relationship,\" he said.\n\nOther than the proposed clinic acquisition, there are no relationships, past or existing, between RHT and RSSB, Mr Mehrotra said. RSSB Singapore held 2.04 million units in RHT as at Nov 15, 2013, or 0.26 per cent, he added.\n\nRHT closed at 76 cents yesterday, down half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Or the stuff you throw out in your annual Chinese New Year spring-cleaning effort. But to Minter, all that trash can account for billions of dollars and even boost a country's economy.\n\n\"I don't know about you, but I've never seen trash worth US$100,000,\" says the 43-year-old who has spent most of his life studying and reporting on the global recycling industry.\n\nThe trash he refers to is what rubbish collection companies in America gather and sell to scrap yards in China for them to recycle. Minter estimates that one container of copper scrap, for example, can easily demand between US$60,000 and US$120,000.\n\n\"The bottomline is: scrap goes to where the manufacturers are. So it is interesting just how strong a magnet China is when it comes to scrap. It is such a big manufacturer that it can pay more for it than say, somebody in Malaysia, even though it's generated in Malaysia. Even Singapore is a big exporter of scrap to China,\" he says.\n\n\"It just goes to show how strong China's economy is and how it's built on recycling content... If the Chinese economy couldn't import scrap metal and scrap paper, it would really be in trouble. Because in some cases, almost half of China's supply of raw materials comes from scrap.\"\n\nMinter has recently consolidated his findings and published them in a book titled Junkyard Planet, which he hopes will help debunk the myths that most people believe about the recycling industry. The book is available in most leading bookstores here.\n\nMinter will also be making an appearance at the Singapore Management University (SMU) next Wednesday to talk about the book and his experience reporting on the US$500 billion junkyard industry.\n\nAs part of his job, Minter has travelled to well over 150 scrap yards in at least 20 different countries over the last decade, and that is not including the ones he visited as a kid growing up in a family that also worked in the recycling industry. Along the way he has witnessed people who have made themselves a fortune working in the business, and finds it especially amazing that manual labourers who work in Chinese scrap yards often earn almost twice what a college graduate working in the scrap yard's offices would make.\n\n\"We all think of recycling as a green activity. We do it because it is the right thing to do. But for people in the business, it has nothing to do with being green. It's about the raw materials. Ultimately, they are in the same business as someone who owns an iron ore mine.\n\nIn the end, what makes the business successful is not good feelings, it's profit. Good feelings and intentions don't turn old cola cans into new ones. Profit does. Nobody digs through another person's trash just because it's a good deed,\" he adds.\n\nAdam Minter will be speaking at the SMU's Li Ka Shing Library Meeting Room at 2pm on Feb 12. Please log on to\n\nwww.smu.edu.sg\n\nfor more information or to register to attend the event. His book, Junkyard Planet, is available at Popular and Kinokuniya at $35.95 before GST.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But with construction recording the largest increase in jobs in a year, cold weather probably was not a major factor in January.\n\n\"It is an improvement but a number this soft does feed worries about slowing US growth,\" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.\n\nThe second straight month of weak hiring - marked by declines in retail, utilities, government, and education and health employment - could be a problem for the Federal Reserve, which is tapering its monthly bond-purchasing stimulus programme.\n\nIt was the weakest two months of job growth in three years. December payrolls were raised only 1,000 to 75,000.The data also comes on the heels of a report on Monday that showed a surprise drop in factory activity to an eight-month low in January.\n\nThe US economy grew at a robust 3.7 per cent annual rate in the second half of last year, buoying hopes that it was now on a path to sustained growth. That optimism is being tested, with other data in January showing slower car sales.\n\nBut there was a silver lining in the US employment report. The jobless rate dropped a tenth of a percentage point to 6.6 per cent last month, the lowest since October 2008.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 6.7 per cent.\n\nThe household survey from which the jobless rate is derived found strong gains in employment. In addition, more people came into the labour force, an encouraging sign for the labour market.\n\nThe participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 63 per cent from 62.8 per cent in December, when it fell back to the more than 35-year low hit in October.\n\n\"We think the employment market is improving, but will do so in fits and starts,\" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.\n\n\"If the employment market continues to weaken, it is likely that the Fed will slow its tapering plans.\"\n\nThe unemployment rate is now flirting with the 6.5 per cent level that Fed officials have said would trigger discussions over when to raise benchmark interest rates from near zero.\n\nBut US policymakers have made it clear that rates will not rise any time soon even if the unemployment threshold is breached.\n\nThe private sector accounted for all the hiring in January. Government payrolls fell 29,000, the largest decline since October 2012.\n\nManufacturing employment increased 21,000, rising for a sixth month. Retail sector jobs fell 12,900 after strong increases in the prior months, the first decline since March.\n\nConstruction payrolls bounced back 48,000 after being depressed by the weather in December. It was the largest increase since December 2012.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose five US cents. The length of the work week was steady at an average of 34.4 hours.\n\nYesterday's report included revisions to data on payrolls, the work week and earnings going back to 2009.\n\nRevisions to this data, which is drawn from a survey of employers, showed 369,000 more jobs than previously thought were created in the 12 months through March 2013, on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n\nThe report also incorporated new population estimates.

The existing cap of $600 for contracts of $1.5 million or more will be removed.\n\nTo discourage off-exchange deals, transfers and onward settlements from on-exchange trades will be charged a $30 fee, while those from off-exchange deals will be charged 0.015 per cent of transaction value, subject to a $75 minimum.\n\nSGX will also introduce incentive schemes, expected to be clearing fee rebates, for market makers and liquidity providers.\n\nThe proposals come after an extensive review of Singapore's capital markets ecosystem in the wake of October's penny-stock collapse. The consultation will last for 12 weeks.\n\nSome of the proposals could be far-reaching if implemented. A minimum 180-day volume-weighted average price of 10 to 20 cents for Mainboard companies could affect 130 to 230 issuers, according to official estimates. Most of those issuers can raise their share price through consolidation, and SGX is prepared to waive all corporate-action fees in relation to share consolidation for two years to aid compliance.\n\nRachel Eng, joint managing partner of WongPartnership, expects minimum prices to be positive for the overall market, noting that share consolidation should not affect a company's fundamentals.\n\n\"By having shares with higher trading prices, listed companies and their shareholders may be less exposed to large fluctuations in price caused by speculative movements,\" she said.\n\nMs Eng is also supportive of proposals requiring the reporting of substantial short positions.\n\n\"Proposing to report short positions would certainly increase transparency, especially for retail investors,\" she said. \"I think market participants should welcome a move towards greater clarity. Other countries do already have such a disclosure mechanism, such as Australia, Hong Kong (China) and the European Union.\"\n\nThe proposal for brokers to collect 5 per cent of collateral for customers' open positions and shortened settlement were also seen as appropriate moves to target contra trading, a Singapore and Malaysia quirk whereby investors can take and close positions within the settlement period without putting up collateral.\n\nAbout 31 per cent of total trading value in the year to October 2013 came from contra trades.\n\n\"A minimum collateral requirement promotes prudent investing, instilling greater discipline in retail investors when they trade,\" OCBC Securities managing director Raymond Chee said. \"While this may have a dampening impact on trading activity, it helps to limit the potential for contra losses that investors may otherwise face. For brokerages, it also lowers the financial exposure they face arising from such customer trades.\"\n\nDavid Gerald, president and chief executive of retail investor advocacy group Securities Investors Association of Singapore, added: \"The introduction of collateral of minimum 5 per cent of open position will help to discourage a gambling mentality and encourage an investing mindset.\"\n\nSGX will also introduce some independence into its regulatory framework, with proposals for independent listing, disciplinary and appeal committees. Those committees will allow industry input into certain decisions, as well as put some separation between SGX's enforcement and investigation roles.\n\nGan Kok Kim, head of group investment banking at OCBC, thought that diverse industry viewpoints will improve the quality of listings here.\n\n\"This is critical given the increasing maturity and sophistication of Singapore's capital markets where we are seeing listings across a broadened range of sectors and from issuers that span the globe,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will have luxury hotels, a shopping mall, a theme park, villas and apartments, casinos and other leisure and entertainment facilities.\n\nThe 2.3 million square metre property was acquired by Landing International's subsidiary, Landing Jeju Development Co, from Jeju Free International City Development Centre for about 136 billion Korean won (S$160 million) last October.\n\nUnder the deal, Landing Jeju will own, manage and operate the resort, while Genting Singapore, through its subsidiaries, will operate and manage the resort's hotels, theme park and gaming entertainment facilities.\n\nIn a proposed investment outlined in Genting's statement yesterday, Genting Singapore's indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Happy Bay, has agreed to subscribe for 8.25 million Landing Jeju shares for 82.5 billion won, and extend 82.5 billion won in shareholder loans to Landing Jeju.\n\nFunding will come from Genting Singapore's cash reserves. The investment is not expected to have any material impact on its earnings per share and net tangible assets per share for the current fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2014.\n\nLanding International, on its part, will subscribe for 3.25 million Landing Jeju shares for 32.5 billion won and top up shareholder loans to Lending Jeju to 82.5 billion won.\n\nUltimately, Happy Bay and Landing International will each own a 50 per cent equity interest in Landing Jeju.\n\nGenting Singapore said that it had been evaluating new investment opportunities in the gaming, leisure, entertainment and hospitality sectors, and sees the proposed acquisition as a \"good opportunity to expand its business into Korea and participate in the growing tourism industry in Korea and Jeju\".\n\n\"We are delighted to have the opportunity to be the first foreign and global operator to develop an integrated resort in Korea,\" said Genting Singapore chairman Lim Kok Thay.\n\n\"We are confident that together with Landing International, we will create a game changer for tourism development and employment in Jeju island.\"\n\nAdded Genting Singapore president and chief operating officer Tan Hee Teck: \"This project fits well into our growth strategy in our areas of core expertise.\"\n\nLanding International chairman Yang Zhihui said that the company has \"long been interested in establishing a presence outside mainland China\".\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate deal, Dynamic Sales Investments, another indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Genting Singapore, has agreed to acquire 810 million new shares in Landing International for HK$243 million (S$39.7 million).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding the impact of these two one-off items, the group's operating profit in 4Q13 registered healthy year-on-year growth,\" said Great Eastern, which boasts of $60.9 billion in assets and around four million policyholders.\n\nUnrealised mark-to-market gains during the last quarter of 2013 were also lower than a year ago when market conditions were more favourable.\n\nFor the full year 2013, its net profit fell 43 per cent to $674.8 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. Gross premiums for the year rose by 21 per cent to about $8 billion. For the quarter, they were up 11 per cent to around $2.1 billion.\n\nGreat Eastern, the oldest and most established life insurance group in Singapore and Malaysia, said excluding the one-off gain of $421.6 million from the sale of its stakes in Asia Pacific Breweries and Fraser and Neave in the third quarter of 2012, its net profit fell 12 per cent.\n\nOperating profit from its core insurance business rose 12 per cent from a year ago to $559.6 million on better performance across all its life assurance funds.\n\nBut the group incurred a non-operating loss of $10.9 million compared to a gain of $161.1 million a year ago due to significant unrealised mark-to-market losses.\n\n\" . . . news of the potential tapering of the US quantitative easing programme in the second quarter of 2013 affected financial markets adversely, and the quarter saw an unusual inversion of the 30-year and 20-year interest rates, which led to significant unrealised mark-to-market losses that impacted overall profit for that quarter,\" it said.\n\nTotal weighted new sales rose 27 per cent from a year ago to cross the billion dollar mark in FY13. Sales in Singapore rose 36 per cent to $680.2 million in 2013 on the strength of its multi-channel distribution strategy. Malaysia sales climbed 13 per cent to $329.9 million on continued strong showing of conventional and takaful business. In Indonesia, the bancassurance tie-up with PT Bank OCBC NISP and the introduction of a group insurance business line contributed to new sales growth.\n\nGreat Eastern's board has recommended a final dividend of 40 cents a share, up from 27 cents a year ago. It also unveiled a special dividend of five cents a share, down from 27 cents a year ago. Including the interim dividend of 10 cents a share paid in September 2013, total dividends for 2013 will be 55 cents a share, down from 64 cents the previous year.\n\nThe final and special dividends will be payable on May 8, 2014.\n\nMacquaries Equities Research said despite the lower dividend per share, it implies a yield of 3.1 per cent which is still \"solid for an Asian insurance stock\". Rival AIA has a dividend yield of 1.1 per cent.\n\nThe research house has an outperform rating on the stock, with 12-month price target of $24.65 a share.\n\nThe tightly-held Great Eastern shares closed seven cents up yesterday at $17.67 a share, with 24 lots traded.\n\nAnalysts said the insurance group's results should support parent OCBC's, which is due to unveil its fourth quarter and 2013 results on Feb 14.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Frankly speaking, some say that (these people) find even the current premiums unaffordable. (The government's subsidies for MediShield Life) should be really significant, in my view,\" she added.\n\nTo give the pioneers peace of mind for the rest of their lives, she said the subsidy amount should be reviewed as and when premiums rise in the future to ensure that they remain affordable for the needy.\n\nWhatever the subsidies are, she said the help \"should be recurrent and not a one-off\" for the pioneer generation to truly benefit.\n\nHer call follows a promise made by Social and Family Development Minister Chan Chun Sing earlier this week that the Pioneer Generation Package would be a \"long-term commitment\" by the government to take care of the elderly for the rest of their lives.\n\nMdm Halimah said the duty of taking care of the pioneer generation should not be the sole responsibility of the government alone. The community and the private sector should also play their part in this \"whole-of- society\" effort.\n\nMember of Parliament David Ong, who is part of the 13-member seniors group, said businesses could give more benefits to their elderly customers such as discounts.\n\n\"Under some community programmes, some hawkers give discounts to needy residents. So maybe we could extend that to the seniors as well - that would be a nice gesture,\" he said.\n\nIn the coming months, Mdm Halimah said, the PAP Seniors Group would hold further dialogues to look at other issues of concern faced by the elderly, such as employment, transport and housing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The index topped 11,500 in mid-2008.\n\nFor the tanker market, rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs) on routes to Asia had climbed since October to their highest level in 18 months, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at industry lobby group Bimco.\n\nAt the same time, growth in the VLCC market slowed to 1.9 per cent year on year in December compared with expected import growth in China of around 4 per cent, which should help boost freight rates. \"I believe we are about to go from bad to better in the very large crude carrier market,\" Mr Sand said, adding that rates for VLCCs on routes to Asia had climbed since October to their highest level in 18 months.

The remaining three new funds are listed in the Asia-Pacific - two in Japan and one in Australia.\n\nIn terms of the geographical exposure of the various new ETFs, a significant portion - nine - have exposure to emerging markets.\n\nMarkit noted, however, that the timing has been rather unfortunate for the emerging market ETFs, with investors fleeing from developing market exposure at a record rate in January, following last month's upheaval in these countries.\n\nIt did point out that two broad emerging market equity funds launched in January - the Market Vectors MSCI Emerging Markets Quality ETF and the Market Vectors MSCI Emerging Markets Quality Dividend ETF, both listed in the US - aim to set themselves apart from the existing crop of funds by filtering index constituents to pick \"quality\" and \"high dividend\" paying shares.\n\n\"Whether this theme hits a note with investors remains to be seen, but the Quality MSCI index (QEM) has outperformed the overall Emerging Market index year to date,\" Markit said in its report. The data firm will analyse the asset flows into these funds in its next report.\n\nLooking at the performance of funds launched in December, Markit noted that Asian funds took the largest share of flows in the last four weeks of 2013.\n\n\"These inflows were mainly concentrated towards (three of the top four newly launched funds), which collectively had US$290 million, with inflows led by the South Korea bond-exposed Arirang Short Term Bond ETF (launched on Dec 19, 2013) which saw US$152 million of inflows in December,\" its report said.\n\nThe other two funds were South Korea-listed KINDEX Money Market ETF - also launched on Dec 19, 2013 - with US$82 million, and Hong Kong-listed Bosera FTSE China A50 ETF - launched on Dec 4, 2013 - with US$70 million.\n\nThe only non-Asian fund to crack the top four largest fund inflows was Lyxors UCIT EUROSTOXX Banks, listed in France, which saw US$148 million of inflows.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The manufacturing is mainly in the area of batteries. It does not have any significant PC manufacturing operations here.\n\nOn Thursday, Sony said that it was selling its PC division which makes the well-regarded Vaio brand of computers to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) for a deal worth in the region of 40 billion to 50 billion yen (S$498-S$623 million), according to various reports.\n\nAs part of the reorganisation, the company will let go of 5,000 employees to stem losses which were forecast at 110 billion yen for the financial year to ending March 31. Out of the 5,000 job cuts, 1,500 would be in Japan and 3,500 overseas.\n\nSony said that around 250-300 Sony Corp and Sony EMCS Corp employees involved in PC operations, including planning, design, development, manufacturing and sales, are expected to be hired by the new company established by JIP.\n\nSony will also explore opportunities for employees to be transferred to other businesses in the Sony Group.\n\nFor employees of Sony Corp and Sony EMCS Corp who are not hired by the new company or transferred within the Sony Group, the company plans to offer an early retirement support programme to assist their re-employment outside of Sony Group.\n\nTo execute these measures, Sony is allocating a further 20 billion yen in restructuring expenses in fiscal 2013 and a further 70 billion yen in fiscal 2014. Sony expects that the retrenchment exercise will result in annual fixed cost reductions of more than 100 billion yen starting in fiscal 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The units are between 776 sq ft and 1,094 sq ft in size and in two- and three-bedroom configurations.\n\nPrices range from $1.16 million to $1.87 million, or between S$1,495 and S$1,709 psf.\n\nHere is a sweetener: The balcony or roof terrace, typically between 72 sq ft and 228 sq ft in size, does not count towards the total floor area; buyers do not pay for the space, unlike in Singapore, said Christine Li, Orange Tee's head of research and consultancy.\n\nWith local banks offering financing to Singapore investors, the profile of such property buyers could change slightly from that of the super-rich, she said.\n\nShe estimates that last year, 150 homes in Japan were sold to Singapore buyers; with accessible financing, she expects the number to cross 200 this year.\n\nThe properties favoured by these newer buyers are mainly in central Tokyo; they tend to be small, usually one- to two-bedroom units with prices starting at $400,000, said consultants.\n\nEric Cheng, the group chief executive of ECG Holdings, said the group held its first Japanese property launch here last October, notching up 21 sales from the 80 people who showed up.\n\nHe has held half a dozen more launches since then, and sold 91 more units.\n\n\"A hundred and twelve units in 2\u00bd months - that gave us more confidence (in the market),\" he said.\n\nHe has lined up 32 launches this year.\n\nThe banks have responded to this investor interest. OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB) began offering Tokyo property financing last year, joining Bank of China, believed to be the pioneer here in selling Japanese real-estate loans.\n\nOCBC is willing to lend up to 50 per cent of the valuation; UOB is more aggressive, offering 70 per cent. Bank of China can offer up to 95 per cent if the buyer places a deposit with it.\n\nDennis Khoo, UOB's managing director and head of personal financial services in Singapore, said: \"In response to customer demand, we expanded our international property financing schemes in 2013 to include Tokyo, Australia and Malaysia.\"\n\nHe added that these new programmes offer investors an opportunity to diversify their investment portfolio across geographies and complement the bank's existing property-financing schemes for properties in London and Thailand.\n\nPhang Lah Hwa, OCBC Bank's head of consumer secured lending, said: \"Buyers of Tokyo properties are sophisticated investors who understand the risks and rewards of purchasing properties in Tokyo.\"\n\nShe noted that the average loan size for such purchases has been around $500,000.\n\nOCBC began selling overseas-property loans for London homes in March 2011. It has since put Melbourne, Sydney and Perth on its list; last year, it added on Kuala Lumpur, Iskandar Malaysia, Tokyo and New York.\n\nMs Phang said: \"We have seen a healthy growth in our overseas mortgage portfolio in the past three years. In 2013, we recorded double-digit growth.\"\n\nJapan seems to have hit the spot with property-crazy Singaporeans, who have been fanning out across the world in search of yields and capital appreciation.\n\nThe announcement last September that Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympics, with the positive buzz from \"Abenomics\", has already caused property prices in Japan to rise; construction costs alone have gone up 15 per cent from a year ago, said ECG Holdings' Mr Cheng.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has introduced various fiscal measures in a bid to lift Japan out of its two-decade-long slump, including that of easing building restrictions in certain test areas.\n\nMs Li added that non-Japanese need not fear curbs against foreign buying. \"Japan is one of those with no curbs. The UK and Malaysia are introducing less-friendly rules for overseas buyers, such as capital gains tax; in Australia, foreigners looking to exit their property investment can sell only to Australians.\n\nAdd to this Tokyo's status as a mature market with almost-guaranteed rental. Occupancy rates are in the high 90 per cent, and gross yields are at 4 to 4.5 per cent.\n\nMr Cheng said the high occupancy rate comes from strong demand from Japanese who come from other cities to work in Tokyo.\n\nHe said: \"They rent the compact units. The projects sold here are typically between 300 and 500 sq ft, brand new, located in central Tokyo and priced at around $1,400 per sq ft.\"\n\nAsked about earthquake risks, he replied that as the projects are all new, they are built to withstand quakes of magnitude 7.\n\nMs Li said: \"I think most buyers of Japan properties are aware of the risks of natural disasters such as earthquake.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We should attract foreigners. But if . . . you penalise them by having to pay additional tax, then they (will) say you don't welcome me.\n\n\"So why don't you (the government) just say, if you sell within three years, four years, then I tax you. You come in (and buy property) I don't want to tax. I think this is one way,\" said Mr Kwek, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas) Spring Festival lunch yesterday.\n\nThe government can also consider lifting ABSD for locals - who are subject to the additional tax when they purchase more than one home - and permanent residents, he said.\n\n\"I don't think there is a lot of speculation. The prices are high because developers have got no land stock . . . in the land bank. (At the same time) they have to survive, they cannot let business come to a standstill.\n\n\"So I think for some of these, we will (need to) have a dialogue with the government . . . I think the government has the bigger picture. We leave it to them. They are trying their best. They want a stabilised market. We will cooperate with them.\"\n\nMr Kwek's comments come amid signs that the housing market is slowing down. Statistics from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed that for the last three months of 2013, private home prices fell 0.9 per cent - the first quarterly drop in about two years. For the full year, URA's overall private home price index ended 1.1 per cent higher - a smaller gain compared with the 2.8 per cent recorded in 2012.\n\nBesides working closely with the government to build a healthy property market, developers will also work closely with the government on the next phase of nation-building and real estate development to achieve a \"distinctive, high-quality living environment for all\", said Chia Boon Kuah, president of Redas.\n\nThis means that construction activity will remain at high levels and continue unabated for several years, making it \"ever more important to re-focus our collective attention on workplace safety and welfare of the some 30,000 migrant workers in our industry\", he said.\n\n\"As developers, we should support our contractors in showing duty of care for the health, safety and welfare of these workers. This enhances productivity, which, in the long run, translates into benefits for all.\"\n\nLast month, a worksite accident in Sentosa left one foreign worker dead and 10 others injured.\n\nThe death of the worker takes the number of fatalities at worksite accidents to nine in just over a month, prompting Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin to write on his blog that the recent spate of accidents was \"not tenable\".\n\nDevelopers and contractors should, therefore, \"up the ante on workplace safety training and communication\" and \"recognise the contributions these workers make to our country\", said Mr Chia, who is also group president and chief executive of developer GuocoLand.\n\nRedas would hold a forum to identify and discuss common causes behind construction workplace accidents, challenges to risk reduction and best practices, he said.\n\nYesterday, Redas presented Mr Kwek with its inaugural Redas Lifetime Achievement Award, which it established to honour a pioneering group of industry leaders.\n\nThe Redas citation said that Mr Kwek has helped to shape the property industry and guided Redas through several difficult periods, such as the property crash in the early 1980s.\n\nTogether with other developers, he also helped to reform the sector by introducing the Developers' Fund to protect buyers. This ensured that money collected for a specific project could not be used for other purposes.\n\nMr Kwek received his award from Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, who was guest-of-honour at the event.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Which explains why the Australian singer-songwriter is constantly collaborating with other musicians - including hip hop's First Couple, Jay-Z and Beyonce - in addition to starting his own bands.\n\nOne of his most commercially successful projects, synth-pop duo Empire of the Sun, is making its return to Singapore later this month to play its first ever headlining show. The band previously performed here in 2010 at the now-defunct Avalon-At-Large music festival.\n\nA collaboration between Steele and fellow Aussie Nick Littlemore - whose band Pnau recorded an album with Elton John in 2012 - the gig finds the duo touring behind Empire of the Sun's new critically acclaimed full-length release, Ice On The Dune.\n\nThe album took five years to make and is the follow-up to their equally successful 2008 debut, Walking On A Dream.\n\nOver the phone from his home in Perth where Steele is taking some time off before the duo kicks off their 2014 world tour with the Singapore show, he reveals that the album wasn't the easiest to make and was borne out of one long mystical road trip.\n\n\"We became explorers; we got lost at sea for a while and spent months in the desert before we finally made it back to civilisation with the artifacts that we found . . . that became the music,\" he says cryptically, as if describing scenes straight out of the music video for the album's lead single, Alive.\n\nSteele also insists there was no difficult-second-album-syndrome and the pair felt no pressure from having to live up to expectations of their critically lauded debut.\n\n\"It's really more about raising your own expectations and musical abilities - to see how your ears have grown,\" he clarifies.\n\nIce On The Dune cracked the top 20 and 30 album charts in the US and UK respectively - no mean feat for an Australian act. Back home, it was nominated for five Arias, Australia's answer to the Grammys. Though it missed out on the major categories such as Best Pop Release and Best Group, the cover art - featuring Steele and Littlemore in their trademark stage makeup and costumes - picked up an award.\n\nThe band's flamboyant image also extends to its visually arresting \"live\" shows which typically feature over-the-top sets, dancers in gaudy costumes and musical instruments that light up on their own.\n\nCritics have compared Empire of the Sun's light-and-sound extravaganza to Cirque du Soleil (minus the acrobats, of course) given their knack for dramatically mixing music with art; and Steele says that the show is constantly evolving to be even brighter and bigger than the last one.\n\nThe band's catchy dance anthems, such as Alive and Walking On A Dream'sWe Are The People, have also appeared outside of their albums and are being used in television advertisements, games and movies.\n\nUnlike some music artists who refuse to license their works for commercial purposes, Steele has no issue with it. \"I think it's great that more people get a chance to hear our music,\" he explains.\n\nThat's probably because he is hardly ever short of a song idea and comes from a musical family.

This has led to an increasing number of those in this largely sedentary middle-aged group participating in physically demanding exercise events, including marathons.\n\nOver the last three decades, marathon running has seen an explosive 80-fold increase in participants. It is not uncommon to hear of people dying suddenly during a marathon. Hence, it is important to understand whether it is safe to participate in vigorous exercise programmes.\n\nWhile data from observational studies have suggested that regular exercise may reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease, there is now substantial evidence to show that vigorous exercise can result in the sudden development of a heart attack, sudden death, stroke and a tear in the wall of the main artery of the body (aorta). These events occur mainly in those who have underlying disease of their heart arteries, known or unknown.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Also, the TDSR framework has single-handedly put a check on escalating property prices and transaction volumes.\n\nReviewing these policies would send the \"right signal\" to foreign investors, said Mr Han.\n\nAccording to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) data, prices of private residential properties decreased 0.9 per cent in Q4 last year - the first time that overall prices have fallen since Q1 2012.\n\nConsultants concur that this is due to the combined weight of TDSR, ABSD and SSD, which have effectively slowed down the pace of the private property market in terms of transaction volumes and the rate of price increases.\n\nNicholas Mak, executive director at SLP International, echoed Mr Han's views, but conceded that it is unlikely the government will remove or reduce any of the cooling measures.\n\nIndeed, while Budget 2014 may be more \"neutral\" on property and provide some preconditions for which measures may be eased, the earliest relaxation of measures will probably be in late 2014 or early 2015, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin. \"Any relaxation will likely come from changes in stamp duties rather than leverage ratios,\" he added, referring to the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and TDSR.\n\nOn the stamp duties front, tweaking the SSD policy might be the way forward, suggested Christine Li, head of research at Orange Tee. Under the current SSD regime, losses are amplified for sellers who bought at a high price and are forced to sell at a loss, she said, adding that this could be catastrophic should interest rates rise or property prices soften.\n\n\"Also due to SSD, many units which have received their Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) are not put on the market, restricting supply. Owners will be forced to rent out the units, intensifying competition in the already weakened rental market,\" she added.\n\nWhile cooling measures preoccupy the industry, the Budget is expected to touch on other areas, including construction and real estate investment trusts (Reits), market watchers said. The construction sector would get some air play, given the continued productivity drive.\n\nThe most pressing issue would be the looming expiration of the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme. Introduced in 2010, the scheme offers tax deductions and payouts to businesses, including construction firms, that spend on productivity-related investments. It is due to expire in 2015.\n\nMany have called for the scheme to be extended or, better yet, improved.\n\nPwC Singapore, for instance, recommended that greater flexibility be introduced in applying the expenditure cap on the scheme.\n\n\"A combined cap or a higher cap for the more commonly undertaken activities would encourage companies to invest more in the activities that are relevant to their businesses,\" it said.\n\nSMEs, for instance, could be allowed to claim higher PIC deductions or allowances for training and the acquisition of IT and automation equipment. Multinational corporations which focus on innovation- led activities on the other hand could enjoy a higher expenditure cap on their research and development and acquisition of intellectual property expenses.\n\nKPMG recommended simplifying the incentives and regulations.\n\n\"More streamlined and effective business regulations and easily accessible tax incentives are particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) . . . The PIC scheme needs revisions to make it less prescriptive and simplified, using principle-based rules,\" said Tay Hong Beng, head of tax at KPMG Singapore.\n\nKPMG suggested that the Land Intensification Allowance scheme (LIA) be extended to other industries outside of the manufacturing sector given that other sectors, such as logistics and transportation, may also invest in new premises or upgrade their current premises to achieve higher productivity.\n\n\"The LIA should therefore be extended to all promoted industrial sectors, for buildings built on land zoned for industrial use (that is, Business 1, Business 2, and Business Park zones). This could be facilitated initially on a case-by- case basis,\" it said.\n\nApart from providing grants and tax incentives to lower the development and implementation costs of new technology, more incentives to encourage innovation should be introduced, said Chua Yang Liang, head of South-east Asia research at Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nHe added: \"Strengthening the ties and collaborations between the industry and polytechnics/research institutions could prove more economical in the longer term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has now maintained its overnight policy rate at 3 per cent for over 10 straight quarters, sticking to its accommodative stance to keep the country's growth engine ticking.\n\nAmong other reasons, the cheap credit has unfurled an unprecedented borrowing binge that's resulted in one of the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios (85 per cent) in Asia, second only to South Korea. That's a potential, although admittedly limited, risk to the financial system, so 2014 could be the time when the central bank takes the punch bowl away from the party. Inflation is only expected to rise given the government's subsidy rationalisation measures and the imposition of a goods and service tax in April 2015. Real interest rates are now negative. As rates rise in the United States with its gradual recovery as well as the tapering of quantitative easing, Malaysian yield spreads will narrow, tempting investors to cut and run. That's seriously not a good idea. Since 2008, when US interest rates dropped sharply, foreign holdings of Malaysian government securities have increased sharply - almost 50 per cent at its peak in May last year. A sell-off would be pretty damaging to the ringgit, which is why the central bank will probably raise rates sometime this year.\n\nThe local currency hasn't been faring too well either. It has already depreciated 2 per cent against the greenback since the beginning of the year, making it the second worst performing currency in Asia in 2014. The sliding ringgit, in turn, exacerbates imported inflation. A hike in interest rates can, and probably should, stem the slide.\n\nBut Bank Negara has limited room for manoeuvre, perhaps around 25-50 basis points at the most. Raising rates even more could hurt both the indebted government and its equally burdened citizenry. The trick is not to allow spreads to narrow so much that there would be a collective rush for the door by foreign investors. Neither should the ringgit be allowed to appreciate too much as this could hurt Malaysian exporters.\n\nIndeed, given improving global economic conditions all around, exports will rise but a relatively cheap ringgit - much as it is now - also makes them more competitive. That will be a plus for Malaysia's external account. The current account surplus on Malaysia's balance of payments has declined to around 4 per cent of GDP from almost 25 per cent in 2008. That has got to be reversed if Malaysia's international reserves are to be preserved. In 1998, it was the combination of a budget deficit coupled with a current account deficit that triggered the speculative attacks on the ringgit.\n\nA reasonable uptick in rates isn't likely to unduly hurt growth either. The World Bank thinks that the Malaysian economy will grow by around 4.9 per cent while the central bank is more optimistic, predicting that growth will be between 5 and 5.5 per cent. That isn't blazing growth but in the circumstances, it's respectable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gross revenue was $1.3 million, from none a year ago. Revenue came from Perennial Jihua Mall, Foshan, which began operations in the third quarter of 2013.\n\nPCRT announced a half-year distribution per unit of 1.9 cents, which works out to an annualised yield of 7.2 per cent based on PCRT's last closing price of 53 cents. For the full year of 2013, amount available for distribution was $43.6 million, unchanged from a year ago. Revenue was $2.6 million, from none in 2012.\n\nThe amount available for distribution came entirely from drawdowns from an earn-out fund, which will last till the end of the year.\n\nOther than Perennial Jihua, PCRT has three other operational assets in Shenyang held under a joint venture, which was hit by a net loss of $7.7 million for the year due to a $13.4 million revaluation loss. This was caused by PCRT's share of the Shenyang Red Star Macalline Furniture Mall being revalued 104 million yuan (S$21.8 million) lower, partially offset by revaluation gains in the other two assets.\n\nDue to foreign exchange fluctuations, net asset value per unit rose from 70 cents in end-2012 to 77 cents in end-2013.

But a key \"hidden\" factor, some say, is whether a credible political opposition can be established to counter Japan's new direction.\n\nThis would create a much bigger threat to the government of Mr Abe than the embarrassment he would suffer if Tokyo voters elect a governor who is opposed to nuclear power in Japan and to the \"extravagant\" Olympic Games, both of which Mr Abe is pushing, analysts say.\n\nThe outcome of the election, they argue, is likely to have a strong bearing not only on the direction of Japanese domestic politics but also on the country's increasingly fraught diplomatic relations with some of its neighbours. As such, it will be widely watched.\n\nWhat appeared at first to be a straightforward contest to elect a replacement for former Tokyo governor Naoki Inose, who stepped down following a political funding scandal, has rapidly escalated into something much larger.\n\nAfter former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa (who in 1994 headed a party that broke the Liberal Democratic Party's near 50-year hold on power) stepped into the ring as a candidate, supported by another popular former prime minister, Juichiro Koizumi, the political stakes were quickly raised.\n\nMr Abe and the LDP then threw their weight behind former health minister Yoichi Mazusoe who is the leading candidate for the Tokyo governor's position, making it clear that the battle is being fought out at the highest political levels.\n\nThe aim of Mr Koizumi and Mr Hosokawa, sources told The Business Times, is to use the Tokyo gubernatorial election as a springboard for forming a credible new political opposition force in Japan to counter the LDP, which since last year has enjoyed an almost total grip on power.\n\nThis has allowed Mr Abe to push through Parliament controversial legislation to form a New National Security Council, to pass a heavily opposed new State Secrets Law and to promote a \"reinterpretation\" and possible revision of Japan's postwar \"pacifist\" constitution.\n\nMr Abe's controversial visit last month to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, where the names of a number of \"Class A Japanese war criminals\" are enshrined, brought unusual criticism from the US government, which voiced \"disappointment\" at the move, and this week Britain's Ambassador Tim Hitchens urged Mr Abe to exercise \"care\" on the issue.\n\nUnder Mr Abe too, the chairman of Japanese public broadcaster NHK has been replaced by Katsuto Momii, whose public statements have suggested that NHK could become something of a government mouthpiece in future rather than a \"neutral\" public broadcasting organisation.\n\n\"Abe-appointed governors now have control of the NHK board, together with the new, like-minded chairman,\" said former Goldman Sachs (Asia) vice-president Kenneth Courtis.\n\n\"The new chairman said in his first press conference that it is 'only normal' for NHK to support government views.\n\n\"The Abe/Aso government (a reference to Mr Abe and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso) is appointing people of similar far right political and ultra-nationalist views to key positions in the bureaucracy, the judicial system, military, and sensitive media positions,\" Mr Courtis added.\n\nNaoki Hyakuta, another NHK governor said to have been hand-picked by Mr Abe, is meanwhile reported to have described the Nanking Massacre as a fabrication, during a speech supporting another candidate in the Tokyo election, former Air Self-Defence Force chief of staff Toshio Tamogami.\n\nMr Tamogami is being backed by former Tokyo governor Shintaro Hashimoto who like Mr Abe and some of his close aides is said to have strong nationalist leanings. Mr Tamogami claimed this week that Japan has been unfairly demonised by the victors of World War II.\n\nAlthough Mr Hosokawa is trailing behind Mr Mazusoe in media polls of voter intentions for Sunday's Tokyo gubernatorial election, sources say that Mr Hosokawa and yet another candidate in the election, Kenji Utsunomiya, may join hands in order to win the election and lock out Mr Mazusoe.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Koizumi plans to use his still-strong support among Japanese voters to promote further candidates in local elections so as to establish a political opposition base, these sources say. Mr Koizumi's son Shinjiro, himself a politician, may serve in this new movement, it is said.\n\nThe former governing Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which was swept from power by Mr Abe at the end of 2012, is said to be close to disintegrating, and veteran politician Ichiro Ozawa, who left the DPJ to form the People's Life Party, is backing Mr Hosokawa in Sunday's poll.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In it, little figurines come to life in different universes recreated from 15 million pieces of the toy brick. It's the Danish toy company's first foray into film and one that took five painstaking years to complete. Using CGI to cleverly mimic stop-motion animation, the concept is a refreshing change from the highly-polished 3D digital fare from Pixar and Dreamworks.\n\nWith The Lego Movie, director-writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street) have slyly put together a colourful cartoon that the audience will only realise is a feature-length commercial for the toy company when the final credits start to roll. That's because the laugh-a-minute script - riddled with various pop-culture references - works hard on its own instead of sitting back and letting the nostalgic brand name do the legwork alone. Not only that, Lego's extensive licensing deals also means the film features an exhaustive list of star cameos including characters from the Harry Potter, The Simpsons and Star Wars franchises; as well as Batman and Superman, just to name a few.\n\nWith all that competition, it's no wonder the protagonist Emmet (Parks and Recreations' Chris Pratt), a construction worker in Bricksville, feels like a nobody. The opportunity to prove himself comes up when he's mistaken by his love interest, the feisty Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), to be The Special One aka The Master Builder who will save the Lego Universe from being destroyed by the evil tyrant Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Together with Batman (Will Arnett) and the wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), the quartet embark on a road trip through different worlds while Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson playing a single character with two interchangeable faces) remains hot on their heels.\n\nIt's a deceptively simple plot - easy enough for children to follow - but also high on satire and brimming with pop culture in-jokes so it doesn't ignore the older audience and keeps them equally entertained with high comic energy. At times, it can get too much though as the film moves a little too fast for its own good by constantly changing genres - from Western to sci-fi to high seas drama.\n\nStill, The Lego Movie is mostly a blast from start to end and brings to mind the original Toy Story which was smart, funny and entertaining with a multi-layered storyline. More importantly, despite being a tie-in, The Lego Movie doesn't feel too much of a hard-sell; for that alone, this deserves to be a blockbuster.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Inflation has surged owing to the government's programme to rationalise subsidies, which has crimped spending.\n\nEven so, the news is completely unexpected. Net exports had been recovering in the fourth quarter, with export growth helped along by a weak ringgit; the local unit depreciated 6 per cent against the greenback in 2013, and has slipped a further 2 per cent year-to-date.\n\nIndeed, that investment was still strong was indicated by a 14.8 per cent year-on-year rise in imports, driven primarily by capital goods (17.8 per cent up). And the trade surplus was still strong at RM9.5 billion (S$3.6 billion), though down from RM9.7 billion in November.\n\nReflecting the pick-up in the developed world, Malaysia's exports were led by electronics (12 per cent), refined petroleum products (62.7 per cent) and liquefied natural gas (16.2 per cent). Overall export growth came in at 2.4 per cent last year, improving from the dismal 0.7 per cent in 2012.\n\nThe Department of Statistics said that export growth last year was led by shipments to South-east Asia and an increase in exports to China and Europe.\n\nTechnology exports recovered, expanding 2.4 per cent for the year, after contracting 2.5 per cent in 2012, largely on the global economic recovery.\n\nChua Hak Bin, an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said in a report released yesterday that the surge will impact GDP growth. \"We expect growth to improve to 5.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, versus 5 per cent in the third quarter.\n\n\"The boost likely came from exports. This will bring full-year GDP growth to 4.7 per cent, down from 5.6 per cent in 2012.\"\n\nMr Chua added that the central bank was likely to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points in the second half of this year to check inflation. So long as exports continue to take the slack, the central bank should be more prepared to raise the policy rate, given that rising prices are a clear and present danger.\n\nMr Chua said: \"The rate hike should also be seen as normalisation as the US Federal Reserve tapers its bond purchases.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This has since dealt a blow to developers' sentiment.\n\n\"The cooling measures are taking effect. It depends on how the market reacts for developers to moderate lower price launches on new units,\" said another survey respondent.\n\n\"Developers who do not have any holding power may dispose units at further discounts at about 3-5 per cent. However, a market crash is unlikely due to fairly strong underlying demand.\"\n\nSeen as more resilient, the office segment is viewed by developers as the best performing with a current net balance of +27 per cent and a future net balance of +20 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nDevelopers expressed concerns over rising costs, with 46 per cent of the respondents saying that they are very concerned about higher land costs and 54 per cent flagging concerns about labour costs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What isn't so favourable is that it will soon have to vote on other transactions linked to this deal, even as some questions are left unanswered.\n\nIn a regulatory filing on Feb 2, RHT said it had agreed to acquire Mohali Clinical Establishment from Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) for $55.1 million.\n\nIt also agreed to enter into separate agreements, which are interested person transactions (IPTs), with its sponsor Fortis Healthcare for the purchase of related equipment and services.\n\nBy the looks of things, the acquisition itself is not an IPT as the vendor of the facility is a third party legally separated from RHT.\n\nThis therefore does not require the approval of RHT unitholders, unlike the IPTs where RHT has proposed to enter with Fortis.\n\nNothing further was said about the identity of the vendor RSSB. Meanwhile, there is much speculation in India about the connections between RSSB and RHT's indirect parent company, Religare Enterprises.\n\nThis raises the question of whether it is appropriate to deem RHT's acquisition a non-IPT.\n\nEven if the deal is technically a non-IPT, the issue of the relationship between RSSB and Religare should spur curious investors here to ask the RHT board crucial questions at the upcoming unitholders' meeting.\n\nSpiritual movement\n\nSo far, RHT has made no mention of any potential links with RSSB or connections between RSSB and its sponsor Fortis Healthcare, except to say that Fortis operates the hospital at Mohali Clinical Establishment.\n\nGurinder Singh Dhillon, father of RHT CEO Gurpreet Singh Dhillon, heads RSSB as its spiritual guru.\n\nAccording to its website, RSSB is one of India's largest spiritual movements and derives its philosophies from the teachings of all religions. Its guru is regarded by disciples as \"god in human form\".\n\nFinancially, the Dhillon family has become one of the richest in India. Mr Gurinder's nephews, Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh, control the extensive healthcare and financial services businesses respectively under Fortis Healthcare and Religare Enterprises.\n\nWhile interweaving relationships in family businesses are not uncommon, investors would be keen to know if there is any influence on decision-making at RHT arising from a connection with RSSB.\n\nAfter all, some investors do base their investment decisions on the values and culture of the company they buy into.\n\nThe deal merits greater scrutiny by unitholders.\n\nFirstly, RHT's planned acquisition of a clinical facility from RSSB would seem like a new approach from RHT's past practice of acquiring healthcare facilities from its sponsor Fortis Healthcare which make up its initial portfolio. Secondly, it is worth noting that the proposed deal accounts for about 8.8 per cent of its net tangible assets.\n\nSingapore Exchange listing rules state that an associate of the CEO is deemed an \"interested person\" in the case of a business trust. An IPT greater than 5 per cent of the group's latest audited net tangible assets would require the approval of the unitholders.\n\nSale deed\n\nWhile no clear links between RHT and RSSB have yet to be determined, the relationship between RSSB's spiritual head and RHT's CEO warrants that more light be shed on RHT's latest transaction.\n\nUnitholders will have to convene soon to vote on the IPTs between Fortis Healthcare and RHT. RSSB has undertaken to execute the sale deed for Mohali Clinical Establishment after the approval of unitholders for these IPTs. At this point, the board of RHT should be asked to provide more clarity.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead, he incorporates them into his \"archaeologic art\" - in his bid to highlight a suppressed culture and history in Indonesia.\n\nInstead of the usual collector's interest in precious Peranakan ceramics or jewellery, which is the case in Singapore and Malaysia, Prayitno is more interested in the spirit of multi- culturism they embody in Indonesia.\n\n\"What the artist is saying is that the Peranakans contribute to an important cultural heritage in Indonesia, and their wisdom and knowledge deserve to be acknowledged as important,\" says Seng Yu Jin, curator for Prayitno's solo exhibition titled Unity in Diversity: Archaeologic Excavation of the Peranakan Tionghua at Equator Art Projects.\n\nThe artist's latest works revolve around Tan Gwat Bing, the first person to establish a photography studio in Yogyakarta in the early 20th century. Prayitno had heard about the imminent demolition of Tan's house and studio, which prompted him to go there to salvage what he could.\n\nThe Yogyakarta-based artist is known for his installation-sculptures using a variety of materials to highlight contemporary social issues such as gender and identity, by remixing forms. Seng, currently a senior curator at The National Art Gallery, Singapore, explains that he's been following Prayitno's works since 2006.\n\n\"He isn't Peranakan, but he understands the importance of multiculturism,\" notes Seng. \"Not just the Peranakans - many ethnic minority groups in Indonesia suffered during the New Order under President Suharto as they could not practise their culture, since Indonesian culture was narrowly defined as Javanese.\"\n\nWorking like an archaeologist, Prayitno began to survey and research the Peranakan Tionghua in Yogyakarta before coming across the \"artefacts\" such as photographs, postcards and books left behind by Tan Gwat Bing.\n\nHe dug into the history of photography in Indonesia and the carpentry techniques used to con- struct Peranakan Chinese furniture that was different from other furniture produced in Indonesia. \"But Prayitno departed from the methods of an archaeologist when he began dismantling the furniture and intervening in these artefacts by inserting Chinese characters,\" says Seng.\n\nPrayitno's \"archaeologic art\" is made through the construction of narratives by recovering previously overlooked culture and knowledge of the Peranakan Chinese in Indonesia. The Chinese had brought modern technologies and ideas - stemming from their desire to be a part of global modernity. They were rooted in their hybrid cultural practices that have produced the famed Pekalongan batik featuring both Chinese and local motifs, Peranakan cuisine and jamu, a form of traditional herbal medicine.\n\n\"Prayitno's reassembly of the furniture into artwork is meant to highlight the historical injustice they suffered through discrimination since colonial times. He also makes visible the lost knowledge and wisdom of the Peranakan Chinese as a community that forms a part of Indonesia's cultural diversity,\" adds Seng.\n\nSeng and Prayitno discussed the artist's concept to focus on the national motto, \"Unity in Diversity\", that initially symbolised the country's recognition of its cultural diversity as a strength under earlier President Sukarno. This changed during Suharto's regime.\n\nOne of his works uses a Garuda Pancasila in which Prayitno had included the Chinese character ping, which means peace. \"The use of Chinese characters was his decision as he wanted to capture the wisdom of the Peranakan Chinese and how the different cultures can learn from each other,\" says Seng.\n\nHis use of history is in a revisionist vein to question the overlooked and suppressed histories of the Peranakan Chinese and, by extension, other ethnic minority groups in Indonesia. He calls his interdisciplinary approach \"archaeologic art\" since he selectively adapts real cultural artefacts and inserts speech bubbles. \"This is very South-east Asian as this region is about the history of selective adaptation to foreign cultures through its history,\" notes Seng.\n\n\"The issue of cultural diversity and how multiculturalism should be embraced rather than treated with suspicion are still issues pertinent today,\" he highlights.\n\nDue to the shipment of the artworks being affected by recent floods in Jakarta, Yuli Prayitno's exhibition has been postponed to Mar 7 - Apr 6,\n\nat Equator Art Projects, 47 Malan Road, #01-21, Gillman Barracks.\n\nFor more information, please go to\n\nwww.eqproj.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Commercial aircraft business margins have room to widen, he said, due to faster jet production and the ability to get better prices from suppliers.\n\nBut he said it is a \"fair criticism\" that Boeing needs to do more to help suppliers on engineering and process improvement that will provide better prices.\n\nHe said that about one-third of Boeing's suppliers are involved in the company's \"partnering for success\" programme, under which they work together to reduce costs and share the benefits. The remaining two-thirds are either in discussion or not engaged in the programme, he said. He said he expects the programme to continue to grow. \"We have volume to offer and they have efficiency they can offer,\" he said.\n\nMr McNerney also acknowledged that Boeing is hiring contract workers to help fix production problems at the 787 Dreamliner factory in South Carolina, and that some work was being moved to the Seattle area to be finished.\n\nHe also acknowledged that there were \"still some hard feelings\" with machinists in the Seattle area after an acrimonious contract vote last month that ensured Boeing's new 777X jet programme would be located in Washington state.

This, without a doubt, will impact our revenue,\" StarHub CEO Tan Tong Hai explained in an earnings call yesterday.\n\nIn the mobile services segment, there was more reason for cheer, with revenue up 0.8 per cent at $310.5 million, on the back of a whopping gain of 60,000 postpaid customers against the previous quarter .\n\nThis was attributed to a secondary line programme for family members of subscribers that StarHub had introduced, as well as growth in the enterprise sector.\n\nBy the end of the quarter, close to 50 per cent of StarHub's postpaid customers were on the tiered data price plans, with 16 per cent of that group busting their monthly data limits.\n\nAt the same time, postpaid average revenue per user (ARPU) stood at $69 for the quarter, against $70 from a year ago.\n\nThe pay-TV segment recorded the second consecutive quarter of net subscriber gains, aided by StarHub's ability to offer the Barclays Premier League matches on its platform.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, it added 2,100 residential customers to the fold against the previous quarter, taking the total to about 533,000.\n\nRevenue for the segment grew 2.1 per cent to $99.7 million for the quarter, while ARPU stood at $52, up from $51 in the previous year's fourth quarter.\n\nWhile the World Cup looms this year as the next major battleground for pay-TV operators, negotiations remain ongoing and no conclusion has been reached yet, according to StarHub.\n\nRevenue for StarHub's fixed network services segment also grew from $94.7 million to $97.3 million - a 2.8 per cent increase.\n\nFor the group, earnings per share stood at 4.9 cents for the quarter, down from 5.1 cents for the last quarter of 2012. For the year, EPS rose from 20.9 cents to 21.5 cents.\n\nStarHub has declared a final dividend of five cents a share, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nIts shareholders are slated to see more of the same this year, as StarHub said that its annual cash dividend of 20 cents per share would remain in place for 2014.\n\nNoting the challenging conditions in the pay-TV and broadband space, as well as the general uncertainty of the year ahead, StarHub chief financial officer Nicholas Tan expressed the need to be \"cautious\" and \"circumspect\" where dividend pronouncements were concerned.\n\nThe group's counter closed at $4.23, up four cents, before its earnings were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Eight famous wine-growers from Burgundy and two from Spain graced the occasion and presented their wines. In addition, one Spanish and five Burgundian growers who were unable to be present were represented by their wines.\n\nStarting on Friday, Jan 24, with a Gala Charity Wine Dinner and Auction and continuing through to Sunday morning, the Paulee was held to highlight and raise funds for three charities which run vocational training courses for Singapore's autistic young adults.\n\nIn all, 84 wines (63 burgundies and 21 Spanish) were shown in three half-day sessions chaired by wine authority Serena Sutcliffe M W. Her commentaries and tasting notes alone were worth the price of admission!\n\nIn addition there were the extremely interesting comments from the wine-growers present about their wines.\n\nPresent from Burgundy were Veronique Drouhin, Domaine Drouhin; Pierre-Henry Gagey, Domaine Louis Jadot; Erwan Faiveley, Domaine Faiveley; Jean-Charles le Bault de la Moriniere, Domaine Bonneau du Martray; Dominique Lafon , Domaine Lafon; Jean-Luc Pepin, Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue; Nicolas Potel, Domaine/Maison Roche de Bellene; and Olivier Halley, Ch\u00e2teau de Meursault & Ch\u00e2teau Marsannay.\n\nFrom Spain came Pablo Alvarez of Bodega Vega Sicilia (Ribera del Duero), Bodega Alion (Ribera del Duero), Bodega Pintia (Toro) and Benjamin Rothschild & Vega Sicilia (Rioja); and Alvaro Palacios of Palacios Remondo (Rioja), Descendientes de J. Palacios (Bierzo) and Alvaro Palacios (Priorato).\n\nThe theme for the Burgundy tasting was \"Burgundy 2010 and 2011\". Readers may remember the unanimous acclaim that greeted the Burgundy 2009 vintage and which was repeated when the 2010 vintage came along - two very fine vintages.\n\nThe 2011 vintage was beset by unfavourable conditions during the growing season but was saved by better weather in the final period leading up to the harvest. The 2010, in contrast, had more favourable conditions and produced a vintage which rivalled the preceding 2009 for acclaim and fame.\n\nThe consensus today is that 2010 is one of the greatest Burgundy vintages ever, a classic and long keeper. 2009 is great but different; more rounded, more lush, and will be ready earlier. Some very good wines can be found in 2011 - and will be less expensive.\n\nFor those wishing to know what to buy, the advice is easy. Buy whatever you can find of all three vintages!\n\nWHITE WINES\n\nIt is easy to wax lyrical about the reds, but for me it was the whites which stood out. They were great whites, two vintages in white burgundies which are must-buys.\n\nChablis Premier Cru Vaillons 2011 and 2010, Domaine Drouhin Vaudon\n\nThe 2010 was slightly bigger-bodied than the 2011, both giving forth lovely aromas - roses and ripe berries. Great freshness and acidity in both, perhaps slightly more conspicuous in the 2011. Overall not much to differentiate between the two. I find both irresistible and would buy both.\n\nThe drawback, if you can call it one, is that both need ageing - 10 years at a minimum, 20+ years preferably.\n\nThe advantage is that Chablis as a whole are not as expensive as the Pulignys and Meursaults, and you will have two magnificent inexpensive white wines to enjoy early, but even better after some bottle age.\n\nBourgogne Blanc 2011 and 2010, Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue\n\nThis wine is the de-classified De Vogue Musigny Blanc Grand Cru. 1993 was the last vintage and was released as Musigny Blanc Grand Cru. The following year, the vineyard was extensively replanted, and today the vines are not yet old enough to qualify for Grand Cru certification.\n\nThis pair of wines was sandwiched between the Chablis pair and the Puligny-Montrachet Pucelles (Leflaive) and the comparisons and contrasts could not have been more fascinating, and especially more demonstrative of the influence of \"terroir\".\n\nFirst, the two Bourgogne Blancs. Bourgogne Blanc they may be labelled but on the nose and on the palate, these two wines literally blew all the other wines, white and red, away.\n\nBoth light gold, glistening in the light. Very fragrant aromas, showing great minerality - it was difficult to choose which had more minerality. Both were big wines, the fragrance of 2010, and 2011's minerality. Both were big-bodied, in volume and density. The similarities between the two were very close. On balance the 2010 appeared a little more concentrated and consequently tasted drier.\n\nPuligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pucelles 2011 and 2010.\n\nDomaine Leflaive\n\nThe white burgundies of Domaine Leflaive are for most wine lovers the gold standard in white burgundy. And Pucelles Premier Cru the finest of the Premiers Crus.\n\nThe way in which the soil of Puligny-Montrachet influences the palate was fascinating. The beautiful aroma in both was dominated by lime, with a small hint of dried orange peel in the 2010. Aroma in both was incredibly fine, light and haunting, with the 2011 a shade finer, almost rapier-like and haunting in its finish. On balance I preferred the 2011, although it would be folly not to buy the 2010 also.\n\nA fascinating comparison of Corton Charlemagnes next, the 2011 and 2010 of Domaines Bonneau du Martray, Faiveley and Louis Jadot.\n\nCorton Charlemagne 2011 and 2010\n\nDomaine Bonneau du Martray\n\n(Disclaimer: I am involved in the distribution of the wines of this Domaine.)\n\nThe 2011 was big-bodied, very ripe fruit, very, very long; light flavour of orange peel and nuts (predominantly peanuts).\n\nThe 2010 was marginally riper, similar flavours on the palate, but denser and richer. Very, very long; a tour de force.\n\nDomaine Faiveley\n\nAn interesting contrast in styles.\n\nFaiveley's wines are distinctly bigger and broader in body, the 2011 almost chewable, more orangey in flavour and denser texture, especially the 2011. A bigger and denser style of Corton Charlemagne.\n\nFrom past and recent experiences with older vintages (1988 and 1986) of this wine it should be noted here that there has been in recent vintages a distinctively different emphasis in the style of Faiveley's wines, both white and red.\n\nThe wines in the past were very reserved and profound, taking more than a decade to mature. In contrast, the more recent vintages are more approachable even in their youth, showing a style which might colloquially be called \"user-friendly\".\n\nDomaine Louis Jadot\n\nThe 2011 had a scent of talcum powder amidst the lime and orange scents on the nose, while the 2010 was more minerally and citrus scented. On the palate, 2011 was more forward with very orangey fruit flavours in the mouth and very, very long. The 2010 also showed very ripe fruit, but with broader and denser flavours, with pronounced nutty flavours on the finish.\n\nTo choose between these three growers would be invidious. They are all wines eminently worthy of Grand Cru status, and all aristocrats of white Burgundy. Choice would come down to a matter of personal taste. If credit- worthiness allows, I would happily recommend all six wines. And the bonus is, they are all sensibly priced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Woodrow (Woody) T Grant of Billings, Montana, that's who - and he truly believes he has just joined the newly-minted millionaire ranks, having received a letter informing him of his good fortune. The only problem is, Woody is old, damaged and delusional - and an alcoholic to boot. The sweepstakes letter he keeps so close to him is merely one of thousands that are sent out each week by a marketing firm, hoping to secure new subscribers for the magazines it represents.\n\nWelcome to Nebraska and the world of Alexander Payne, a director who has a genuine talent for making quirky, quintessentially American films about different facets of US society. In previous films such as Election (1999), About Schmidt (2002), Sideways (2004) and The Descendants (2011), he tackled issues as diverse as high school politics, road trips and journeys of the human spirit with intelligence and humour, and could always be counted on to keep the relationships between central characters at the heart of each film.\n\nAnd so it is with Nebraska, a mid-western state and state of mind that Payne - a native of Omaha - is intimately familiar with, and confident enough of depicting, in black and white. Nebraska the movie is filled with numerous shots of endless farmland, deserted country roads and small-town decay, revealing a sensitivity that other filmmakers may not have.\n\nIndeed, few directors would have attempted to make a film about a rumpled old man limping along an interstate, stubbornly heading towards a payday that doesn't exist. The film, written by Bob Nelson, moves at a sedate pace and a small scale - and it's the little things that make Nebraska interesting.\n\nWhen Woody (Bruce Dern) insists on travelling hundreds of miles to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his imaginary winnings, his son David (Will Forte) decides to play along and drive him there. Their journey takes them through rural Nebraska to Woody's birthplace, a small town where members of his family still live - although exist might be a more appropriate word. There, news of his windfall spreads like wildfire and while some of his old friends in town are pleased for him, others - including his relatives and former business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) - hover around hoping for handouts. Woody, high on beer and oblivious to events around him, simply staggers towards his goal. It's left to the ever-patient David to clean up after him.\n\nThe entire cast, including Woody's delightfully trashy-mouthed wife Kate (June Squibb) and newsreader son Ross (Bob Odenkirk), often resembles characters from a reality show. In several scenes involving the Grants interacting with the townsfolk, Payne proves he has a firm grip on the arcane goings-on in small-town America.\n\nMany of these scenes ring true - but the parts don't always make for an authentic whole. For example, the film could probably have done without Woody's nephews Cole (Devin Ratray) and Bart (Tim Driscoll), cartoonish simpletons inserted for no other reason it seems than comic relief.\n\nWoody drifts in and out of coherence but he remains single-minded in the pursuit of his prize, while David struggles mightily to bring his father back home with his health and dignity intact. He also sees some of his father in himself - and that scares him. During their scenes together, Nebraska reveals itself to be a sweet-natured endeavour, complete with some real-life lessons. \"The guy just needs something to live for,\" says David. Now isn't that the truth.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its subject? Sound.\n\nAs you might imagine, it's difficult to show pictures here of anything that looks remotely exciting from the exhibition. Its most direct pleasures may be had, instead, at the 16 listening stations placed around the small gallery.\n\nPull up a seat, put on a headset and be transported by myriad sonic creations by Singapore artists.\n\nThey range from indecipherable cacophonies and dull throbbings, to melodic lullabies and gentle waves of near silences.\n\nOne would need minutes of careful listening to discern the sonic arcs of the works.\n\nSince the 1980s, various artists have been experimenting with new sonic forms and alternative instrumentations. But because most works tend to be ephemeral and take place in music gigs and record stores, they remain largely under the radar of art history.\n\nCurated by Bani Haykal and Joleen Loh, the exhibition titled Sound: Latitudes and Attitudes is the first survey of its kind to document the elusive history of sonic arts in Singapore.\n\nOnly a few works, such Tang Da Wu and Joe Ng's To Make Friends Is All We Want (1989) and The Artists Village's The Time Show (1990), have attracted some form of documentation.\n\nAnd these have been duly borrowed from the archives of artist-historian Koh Nguang How, the Substation and other individuals and organisations to show at the exhibition.\n\nLoh says: \"Sonic arts are difficult to document and write about. There are so many interpretations and no simplistic signifiers. Obviously, there's no such thing as a sound art curator in Singapore either. But it is an important form of expression and not to be ignored.\"\n\nSeveral of the 17 artists featured in this exhibition began making sonic arts after working on an entirely different media for years.\n\nFor instance, Zul Mahmod and Kai Lam were trained as sculptors. But they found sound art to be similar to creating sculptures - even if the former is not presented in a physical form that the eye can see.\n\nFor other sonic artists such as theatre sound designer Darren Ng and musician Evan Tan, it may be a natural extension of their practices.\n\nInterestingly, the curators have also included the gorgeous soundscapes of acclaimed band The Observatory as important contributions to art form.\n\nCurator Bani, who is himself an acclaimed musician, says: \"The way to appreciate sonic arts is to listen without prejudice. We are all conditioned to interpret sounds in a certain way. But we need to forget that and instead be sensitive to what we hear here. Forget about trying to formulate a structure or meaning - just listen.\"\n\nThe exhibition, which opens to the public today, also features works by notable artists such as Gilles Massot, Song-Ming Ang and Joyce Koh, There are sonic art performances at 7pm by Lam and Shaun Shankaran on Feb 19, Brian O'Reilly and George Chua on March 5, and Gulayu Arkestra, Dennis Tan and Delphine May on March 12.\n\nSound: Latitudes and Attitudes is now on till March 18 at Lasalle College of the Arts, Earl Lu Gallery. Lasalle is located at 1 McNally Street, next to Sim Lim Square.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Current president of the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas), Chia Boon Kuah, has been re-elected for the two-year term ending this year.\n\nThe question of who the position would go to was thrown in the air, after it was announced in October that Mr Chia would be leaving Far East Organisation for GuocoLand.\n\nThis is because membership of the management committee is tied to the company and not the individual.\n\nMr Chia was formerly the chief operating officer of property sales and executive director at Far East Organisation. He took over from Quek Chee Hoon as group president and CEO of Guocoland from Monday.\n\nUnder the Redas constitution, the industry body elects 15 members and can co-opt up to five more to its management committee. This committee then decides on various office holders from among themselves, for roles such as first and second vice-presidents and honorary secretary.\n\nMr Chia was elected president last year, for a two-year term.\n\nWith the shuffle in personnel, Far East was to nominate a new representative to the management committee to replace Mr Chia.\n\nHowever, since Guocoland is also one of the management committee members for the current two-year term, Mr Chia was eligble as a candidate (for president) once nominated as Guocoland's representative.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Redas said that Mr Chia was \"unanimously re-elected\" to be the president again for the current term.\n\n\"Mr Chia expressed his appreciation to management committee members for their strong support,\" it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The official wasn't authorised to discuss the warning publicly and asked for anonymity.\n\nSecurity at Sochi is tight in response to threats of terror strikes by Islamic militants. The Black Sea resort is just a few hundred kilometres from the North Caucasus region, where Russia has been battling Islamic extremists.\n\nUS Representative Peter King, chairman of the House subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on Wednesday that airlines and people attending the Games should take such threats seriously. The New York Republican declined to go into detail about the warning to carriers.\n\n\"Odds are nothing is going to happen, but the odds are higher than for any Olympics, I believe, that something could happen,\" Mr King said in an interview on CNN.\n\nEven with heavy security at the Olympics sites, he said \"there's real cause for concern\" in areas outside of official venues. Mr King said that while fans and guests are \"reasonably safe\", he wouldn't attend the Games as a spectator.\n\nThe warning to carriers was reported earlier by ABC News.\n\nIn a statement, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agency \"regularly shares relevant information with domestic and international partners, including those associated with international events such as the Sochi Olympics\".\n\n\"We are not aware of a specific threat to the homeland at this time,\" the DHS said in the statement. \"This routine communication is an important part of our commitment to making sure we meet that priority.\"\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc is alone among the major US carriers in serving Russia, with one daily Moscow flight from New York's John F Kennedy International Airport. Spokesmen for Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines declined to discuss security issues, as is customary in the industry.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration, which is part of DHS, restricts the size of carry-on containers of gels and liquids, including toothpaste tubes, to no more than 3.4 ounces (100 millilitres). The limit doesn't apply to checked bags, which are scanned by explosives detection machines.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to keep Sochi safe by locking down the seaside city of about 345,000, deploying 40,000 troops and state of-the-art equipment.\n\nSochi, which lies west of the Caucasus Mountains, borders one of Russia's most economically distressed regions, stretching from Chechnya to Dagestan. A separatist movement in Chechnya grew into an Islamist insurgency that spilled into nearby provinces and which Russia has struggled to suppress.\n\nThree suicide attacks last year rocked Volgograd, about halfway between Moscow and Sochi. Russian security forces staged a raid in Dagestan earlier on Wednesday, killing the leader of an extremist group suspected in two of the attacks.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that the US has 140 people, including FBI agents, Homeland Security personnel and the military, working with the Russians on security.\n\nThe Olympics in Sochi will be as \"safe as you can make any large public event in a place where obviously we all know there have been some threats of late\", Mr Kerry said in an interview on CNN. \"We feel that everything has been done that can be done to try to guarantee people safety and security.\"\n\nThe Games open today and run through Feb 23. As many as 10,000 Americans are expected to visit Sochi, according to four Obama administration officials who briefed reporters on Jan 24 on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe US has warned athletes and fans planning to attend the Olympics to be aware of recent terrorist threats from Islamic militants, and the Pentagon has said it's prepared to evacuate Americans from Russia if needed. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The gross floor area (GFA) is approximately 39,795 sq ft, and the lease tenure has about 45 years left.\n\nNicholas Ng, local director of investments at Jones Lang LaSalle, said factories with lease tenures of more than 40 years are rarely available, and that this site would be attractive to industrialists with huge upfront costs or leases which are expiring in the next few years.\n\n\"The factory comes with a dual frontage and would be a good fit for logistics and heavy industrialists, such as marine and offshore engineering firms looking to establish a base in Tuas. Supporting businesses that set up in Tuas South will benefit from the long-term consolidation of port activities in Tuas and the upcoming BioMed One and Lube Park,\" he said.\n\nThe site is in a Business 2 zone and has a plot ratio of 1.4. Situated in Tuas Industrial Estate, it is accessible via the Ayer Rajah Expressway and Pan Island Expressway. Accessibility will improve when a viaduct linking Pioneer Road to Tuas South is completed in 2016.\n\nThe sale by Expression of Interest will close at 3pm on March 13.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The UMW Oil & Gas subsidiary acquired its first two jackup rigs from SD Standard Drilling, paying US$214 million for the first rig and US$223 million for the second.\n\nAs for Keppel FELS, this is the 75th KFELS B class rig ordered since 2000, or an average of six of the rig type ordered per year. The rig was designed by Keppel's technology arms, Offshore Technology Development and Bennett Offshore, and is considered by rig owners as the industry standard for modern jackup rigs.\n\n\"We have taken the opportunity to acquire another KFELS B class jackup from Keppel FELS to enable UMW Oil & Gas to accelerate the growth of our assets portfolio and meet the strong demand for premium jackup drilling rigs in the Asia Pacific region,\" said UMW Oil & Gas president Rohaizad Darus.\n\nThe KFELS B class jackup rig can operate in water depths of 400 feet (122 metres) and is capable of drilling in water depths of 30,000 feet (9,100 metres). It is also equipped with accommodation facilities for up to 150 people.\n\nUMW's first jackup built by Keppel FELS, UMW NAGA 4, is deployed off Malaysia, while its second rig UMW NAGA 5 is expected to be delivered in May next year with a charter from Nido Petroleum Philippines. The company currently owns a semi-submersible rig and three premium jackup rigs and four hydraulic workover units.\n\nUMW Oil & Gas is building up its offshore drilling rig fleet and intends to grow from a regional to global player. The group announced in May last year a proposal to list on Bursa Malaysia and is in the midst of a reorganisation to facilitate the listing.\n\nAnalysts believe the rig replacement cycle for offshore jackups will continue to bring in new orders for Keppel this year. Projections of new orders secured this year are at between $6 billion and $7 billion. The group has options outstanding for five Super B class jackup units with US driller Trasocean and one with Ensco.\n\nIn 2013, Keppel secured $7 billion of new contracts at its offshore & marine division, and ended the year with a record order backlog of $14.2 billion, with visibility into 2019. Keppel's offshore & marine division posted FY2013 net profits of $930 million (FY2012: $937 million), and accounted for 66 per cent of the group's net profit.\n\nLast year, Keppel FELS also secured contracts from Mexican drilling group Grupo R to build five KFELS B class jackup rigs worth over US$1 billion, which the group saw as a significant milestone and a breakthrough into the Mexican offshore market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, the story of the fearless flying boy will be told not with a sweet Disney-esque charm - but with a dark and cruel edge.\n\nAs Wilson put it in an interview with Artinfo Germany: \"I think Peter Pan is a prism of very many personas - the dark sides of the character and the lighter sides, and how they somehow support each other. This is one of the failures of Disney's Peter Pan; it's too light. Only when you're in hell do you know where heaven is.\"\n\nStrange songs such as To Die Will Be An Awfully Big Adventure, written and composed by experimental New York band CocoRosie, will pepper the tale. And with the production being mounted by the famous Berliner Ensemble - the company founded by Bertolt Brecht (1898 - 1956), one of the most revered dramatists of all time - this Peter Pan will surely upend all expectations of JM Barrie's beloved fairytale.\n\nThough the spirit of Walt Disney is unwelcome in Peter Pan, the spirit of Martha Graham has certainly been called forth to roam the grounds and haunt the hallways in the festival's second offering Martha@ . . . The 1963 Interview.\n\nGraham, a pioneer of contemporary dance, died in 1991. But those familiar with her work will feel a chill when dancer and female impersonator Richard Move takes to the stage to play the grand dame herself.\n\nSince 1996, Move has been giving a series of \"re-performances\" by channelling the dancer and re-enacting pivotal performances and interviews she gave. You may be tempted to say \"tacky\", but critics have called them anything but. The New York Times described Martha@ . . . The 1963 Interview as \"brilliant\" as it \"explores a more fragile side of that great, lonely artist and her studied mask of genius\".\n\nGraham - who was then 69 - had discussed her most memorable stage personas including Medea, Clytemnestra and Saint Joan. What transpired in that famous interview was not just a lesson in absolute craft and conviction, but also melancholy as the dancer mourned her final days on stage, as age finally caught up with her limbs.\n\nIn Martha@ . . . The 1963 Interview, Move delivers every word, cadence and gesture that Graham presumably dispensed during the interview, while two dancers from the Martha Graham Company silently perform excerpts of her works in the background.\n\nNow, if Brecht via Wilson and Graham via Move are too intertextual for your taste, how about a more traditional art form to appease the purist in you? One from Japan, perhaps?\n\nKyogen is a type of medieval comedy which, together with noh (musical drama), bunraku (puppetry) and kabuki (dance), represents the classical theatre arts of Japan. One of its leading practitioners, Mansai Nomura, will present a kyogen act in Sambaso, an ancient dance, music and comedy celebration performed in villages to invoke the gods and implore for a bountiful harvest.\n\nNomura, though big in Japan, may not be so familiar to Singaporeans. But the other name that headlines Sambaso will surely give visual arts lovers here a frisson up the spine: Hiroshi Sugimoto. Sugimoto is, of course, the world-renowned photographer revered for his austere black- and-white photography and, most recently, his design of Hermes scarves.\n\nFor Sambaso, Sugimoto was invited to design the set and costumes. The New York-based shutterbug turned to his Lightning Fields photography series for inspiration, recreating the intricate shape of lightning faithfully onto his stage designs.\n\nSambaso, Peter Pan and Martha Graham are just the latest three titles to be unveiled for the festival, coming on the back of the first list that featured Michael Nyman's Facing Goya, The Wooster Group's Troilus And Cressida, and Jerome Bel's Disabled Theater.\n\nFestival director Ong Keng Sen says he selected works that have visual spectacle, artistic depth and a connection with deeper cultural legacies. He says: \"In recent years, I feel that the Singapore arts scene has been in a rut. Arts companies, wary of their bottom line, are afraid to stage something too risky or experimental because they fear they won't sell enough tickets to break even. So they stick to what's popular and accessible.\n\n\"But I believe this divide between the risky and the accessible is a false one. I think a work can have visual spectacle to please a lot of people, but at same time the depth and substance that make it a strong work of art. I believe we can have spectacle and depth at the same time.\"\n\nThe Singapore International Festival of Arts runs from Aug 12 to Sept 21. Ticket details will be announced later.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/california-critics-book-aims-shake-industry", "site_title": "California critic's book aims to shake up an industry", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCalifornia critic's book aims to shake up an industry\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 6, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[WASHINGTON] As wine editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, Jon Bonne is the leading voice in a general-interest publication covering the heart of the California wine industry. He's also controversial, for he has been one of California wine's harshest critics.\n\nIn The New California Wine: A Guide to the Producers and Wines Behind a Revolution in Taste, published in November, Bonne argues that California's wine industry has been on the wrong path for more than two decades, pursuing bigger, riper wines and higher point scores from critics at the expense of the character that made California wines great in the first place. \"Again and again I was disappointed by what I found to be the shortfalls of California wine: a ubiquity of oaky, uninspired bottles and a presumption that bigger was indeed better,\" he writes.\n\nBonne is not the only prominent writer to criticise the prevalent style of California wine. Eric Asimov of The New York Times champions winemakers who strive for a more elegant, lower-alcohol style of wine. Bonne, however, is harder to ignore because of his base in San Francisco. Many in the wine industry regard him as a pest.\n\nBonne writes of the suspicion that greeted him, a New Yorker, when he arrived in San Francisco in 2006. Resentment still echoes today. \"He's anti-California,\" one prominent Napa winery executive sniffed recently.\n\nCritics of the prominent California style are often accused of being effete Euro-snobs intent on finding \"nuance\" in their wines. But Bonne doesn't argue that California should make European-style wines. Rather, he wants California to return to the style of the 1970s, when the Golden State's wines first triumphed over the best of France in the famous 1976 Judgment of Paris tasting.\n\nThat was 30 years before Bonne joined the Chronicle. \"How fast things changed - from just being happy to be in the conversation to winning the Judgment of Paris, then wave after wave of investment by the wealthy and bored eager to prove their egos in a new field,\" Bonne said recently during a visit to Washington to promote his book. \"After 30 years of being told how awesome it was, California had drunk the Kool-Aid.\"\n\nBonne's book should be mandatory reading for all fans of American wine. He details how California became divided between Big Wine: the three companies (E&J Gallo, Constellation and the Wine Group) that produce nearly two-thirds of the state's wines; and Big Flavor, the exorbitantly priced cult wines that favour extraction, oak, high point scores and exclusivity. From boring to . . . well, expensive and boring. Bonne searched for something between the innocuous supermarket wines and the cult cabs.\n\nHe found a few familiar holdouts for the old California style in Paul Draper at Ridge, Ted Lemon at Littorai and Josh Jensen at Calera. Over time, as Bonne explored California's wine regions, he met others. Most, such as Steve Matthiasson with his eponymous label or Sashi Moorman of Sandhi, are consultants with high-profile wineries who are staking claims to new California wine with their own labels. They typically cannot afford their own vineyards but negotiate agreements with growers to allow them maximum say in how the grapes are farmed. Bonne celebrates winemakers who get out of the winery and into the vineyard.\n\nThere's a weakness to his argument. Big Flavor has been successful as a paradigm for California wine not simply because a few wine writers have championed it but because consumers have welcomed it. The style pendulum may be swinging back toward restraint over hedonism, but the wineries Bonne favours are the fringe.\n\nProducers such as Scholium Project, Anthill Farms and Hirsch make small amounts of wine available primarily through direct-to-consumer sales or allocated in small amounts to restaurants. And they are not cheap. These producers are not about to become the new face of California wine, except to a dedicated minority of wine drinkers.\n\nRight now, consumers like things as they are. As James Laube, California editor of Wine Spectator and a champion of the California style Bonne disdains, wrote in November: \"If he wants to make the case that wines of restraint are the future for California, he must explain why it's for their own good to wean people away from what they like.\"\n\nBonne's response to that criticism is unprintable here. He is content to be at the tip of a movement, like an art critic challenging his readers to question their perspectives and prejudices when viewing a painting.\n\n\"What I think is troubling is that there are still folks talking as though taste, which is what wine criticism is really about, is objective,\" he says. \"The evidence points dramatically to the contrary.\" - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

They run counter to the views of board pessimists such as former International Monetary Fund economist Sayuri Shirai, who worry that faster inflation and the higher sales tax may hit consumption harder than expected.\n\nRecent data pointed to an economy that continues to pick up momentum on strong domestic demand, driven by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's massive fiscal and monetary stimulus.\n\nSome BOJ officials, however, worry about lacklustre growth in exports. Mr Iwata echoed that view, saying that sluggish growth in Asean economies, which have close ties with Japan, was largely behind soft exports.\n\n\"But we expect these economies to gradually gain momentum in the long term as the recoveries in the United States, Europe and China start to spread,\" he said, adding that exports will gradually increase as global demand recovers.\n\nExports to Asia as a whole make up more than half of Japanese shipments, with the Asean bloc taking up one-seventh of the total.\n\nThe BOJ has kept monetary policy steady after offering an intense burst of stimulus in April last year, pledging to double base money via aggressive asset purchases to spur inflation to 2 per cent in roughly two years.\n\nThe central bank has said that the current stimulus programme is enough to achieve the price target, and that it will not respond to any temporary slump in the economy.\n\nJapan's core consumer inflation rose at the fastest pace in more than five years in December, a promising sign that the central bank's inflation goal was within reach.\n\nMr Iwata said that the BOJ will not end its ultra-easy policy unless 2 per cent inflation is achieved in a stable manner, reassuring markets that briefly meeting the target will not automatically prompt the bank to start withdrawing stimulus. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Separately, it was also fined $2.3 million by the Swiss Competition Commission for a Swiss air cargo competition law case. In the latter, it has said that it will study the grounds of the decision and decide whether to make an appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, the one-off items from Tiger Airways arose from impairment in its Indonesian cub Tigerair Mandala and losses related to the sale of Tigerair Philippines, working out to a total of $46 million. SIA holds 40 per cent of Tiger, which is divesting its 40 per cent share of Tigerair Philippines to budget carrier Cebu Pacific at a loss of $30.3 million.\n\nExcluding the exceptional items and impairment losses, net profit would have improved by 23.1 per cent, SIA said.\n\nFor the quarter under review, operating profit climbed 15.3 per cent to $151 million, while group expenditure was flat at $3.72 billion as the 5.6 per cent easing in average jet fuel prices was offset by an appreciation in the greenback. Staff and non-fuel variable costs were also higher in tandem with increased capacity.\n\nEarnings per share were 4.3 cents, down from 12.1 cents previously.\n\nThe parent airline company registered an operating profit of $130 million - up from $87 million - due to a 1.2 per cent dip in expenditure. It carried 2.1 per cent more passengers in the third quarter at 4.78 million, while passenger carriage (in revenue passenger kilometres) inched up 0.7 per cent, ahead slightly of the 0.5 per cent increase in capacity (in available seat-kilometres) which pushed load factor by 0.1 percentage point up to 79.4 per cent.\n\nSIA Engineering's operating profit slid from $31 million to $25 million, and regional arm SilkAir also saw its operating profit drop to $6 million from $34 million previously.\n\nSIA Cargo was just barely in the black registering a $1 million operating profit as it scales back capacity to match demand, although this is an improvement from the $29 million loss incurred in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Cargo yields will continue to come under pressure, the group warned, as the cargo business struggles with overcapacity and flat demand.\n\nFor the nine months, net profit rose to $332.5 million, up 7 per cent, while revenue edged up 1.6 per cent to $11.6 billion.\n\nCommenting on outlook, SIA cited a challenging operating environment where fuel prices have remained stubbornly high and rival carriers continue to roll out competitive air fares.\n\n\"Advance passenger bookings for the fourth quarter are slightly lagging the planned capacity increase due to the shift in Easter holiday travel demand from March last year to April this year,\" the group said, adding that its efforts to boost loads will continue to bring yields under fire.\n\nIt plans to adjust flight schedules and capacity in order to better match demand.\n\nCash and cash equivalents stood at $4.91 billion as at Dec 31, 2013, up from $4.85 billion.\n\nThe counter closed at $9.50 yesterday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In Singapore, it tracks 35 stocks which are basically in two indices, the key Straits Times Index (STI) and the MSCI Singapore.\n\nOCBC had raised its final dividend to $0.17 a year ago, while DBS has been paying out flat dividends since 2008. UOB paid an additional special dividend last year, Markit said.\n\n\"We are expecting this year's final dividend from UOB to include the special component last year to yield a total dividend per share of $0.50,\" it said.\n\nFor 2012, DBS, OCBC and UOB paid out total dividends of $0.56, $0.33 and $0.70, respectively.\n\nThe 12-month forward yield based on Wednesday's share price for DBS, OCBC and UOB is expected to be 3.5 per cent, 3.8 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively, said Markit. \"We note that average yield of the Singaporean banks is slightly higher than the index average of 3.5 per cent.\"\n\nThe telcos continue to be among the top performers within the STI with above 5.0 per cent yield, it said.\n\n\"When compared with other developed markets (Australia, Japan and Hong Kong) we are currently covering, the Singaporean banks' average yield is noticeably lower than nearly 6.0 per cent of the Hong Kong and Australian banks, but higher than below 2.0 per cent of the Japanese banks,\" said Markit.\n\nWhile the sub-4.00 per cent yields look pretty impressive compared with the interest rates of less than half a per cent for bank savings, they have not yet reached screaming buys, said one analyst. \"Fair value, not screaming buys,\" the analyst said.\n\n\"Still early days if you want to focus on very attractive yields,\" said CIMB research head Kenneth Ng.\n\nAt the end of 2008, forecast yields of the three banks were between 4.9 per cent and 6.2 per cent, Mr Ng recalled.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 400-kg satellite is equipped with an electro-optical camera that can take images at ground resolution of one metre.\n\nThe satellite is suited for applications such as disaster and environment monitoring, maritime safety, urban planning and homeland security.\n\nSTEE-SatComS has also partnered Satrec Initiative and SPOT Asia to distribute the satellite imagery from TeLEOS-1, which is expected to be commercially available in the first half of 2016.\n\nThe imagery will complement those from sun-synchronous orbit satellites, enhancing the services of its two partners and benefiting their end-users, ST Electronics said.\n\nAt the convention, STEE-SatComS also revealed that it had signed a deal with New York-listed Alliant Techsystems (ATK) - a US multinational engaged in small satellite bus technology - to jointly develop microsatellites and supply integration services to meet a rising demand from government and commercial space customers.\n\nThis will in turn \"help to grow a vibrant and sustainable space industry in Singapore\", ST Electronics said.\n\nThe microsatellites will be produced at ATK's space systems division manufacturing facility in Beltsville, Maryland, US.\n\nThereafter, future versions will be made at STEE-SatComS' satellite assembly, integration, testing and production facility here.\n\nBoth companies will also split marketing and promotion efforts geographically, with STEE-SatComS overseeing the Asia-Pacific, and ATK the Americas, Europe and Middle East regions.\n\nSpeaking at the event, S Iswaran, Second Minister for Trade and Industry, noted that as the local space industry develops, opportunities will abound for international companies to work with local players to co-develop satellite solutions and access growth markets.\n\n\"This partnership (between ST Electronics and ATK) bears testament not only to our technical strengths, but also Singapore's favourable location for business growth and market connectivity,\" he said.\n\nSingapore is driving efforts to grow its space industry. The government unveiled a $90 million Satellite Industry Development Fund at last year's budget to support the sector in various areas, including public-private tie-ups in research and development.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's no wonder the crowd goes wild in this rousing homecoming concert, recorded over two nights in October 2012. At 71, her voice has aged like fine wine and she shows off those impressive pipes from get-go in the showstopping opener, As If We Never Said Goodbye. Originally a number from the West End musical Sunset Boulevard, she turns it into a tribute anthem for her fellow Brooklyn-ites - something which she does a lot throughout the evening by altering the lyrics of some of the songs to namecheck her 'hood. The set comprises mostly of classics from the Great American Songbook (That Face; Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered; My Funny Valentine; Some Other Time) and guest stars like Chris Botti and her son Jason Gould drop in for duets. In Streisand's own words, the concert album is \"a celebration of the music that (she) loves by the people that (she) knows\"; Back to Brooklyn definitely delivers on that note even though the excessive stage banter between songs sometimes get in the way.\n\nRating:\n\nA-\n\nCeline Dion\n\nLoved Me Back To Life\n\nCeline Dion goes big without going overboard on Loved Me Back To Life, her 11th English-language studio album and first in about five years. It's a mellower-than-usual affair where the French-Canadian diva proves she's not just a scream queen by trying to blow her lungs (and our eardrums) out. Instead, she exhibits a different and richer side of her vocal range - one where she's not afraid to hit the lower register on the moody Adele-ish ballad Breakaway and the bossa-inspired At Seventeen. While she may not be the most musically adventurous pop artist out there, Loved Me Back To Life finds Dion doing what she does best over 13 soaring and slightly over-produced mid-tempo power ballads ... exactly the sort of thing her fans will expect from her.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nBeyonce\n\nBeyonce\n\nBeyonce's new album boasts a couple of firsts in the music industry - it dropped on the unsuspecting public out of the blue on iTunes without any prior publicity and is the first to feature accompanying music videos for every single track making this a complete sight-and-sound experience. It's an experiment that could have gone very wrong for the Queen of R&B but she pulls it off like a true pop royal even though most of the songs don't have the commercial edge of her earlier works. The heavy dub-step funk of Blow and Partition; as well as the edgy soul of Rocket and Superpower (featuring Frank Ocean) show not only the maturing of an artist but possibly the future of hip hop.\n\nR\n\na\n\nting: A\n\nDami Im\n\nDami Im\n\nWinner of The X-Factor Australia last year, there's no question that Dami Im can sing. And to prove the Korean-born Aussie has a big voice that can tackle almost any genre, she's been given the task of covering a mixed bag of artists on her self-titled album. Too bad she belts out every song - from U2's One to Prince's Purple Rain and Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water - with the same robotic gusto and eagerness of a reality singing show contestant out to impress the judges. It's showboating at its best but also stretched to the point where every song feels robbed of its soul. Note-for-note covers of recent hits like Katy Perry's Roar and Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball are even more pointless, making this as forgettable as a karaoke session. A more personal approach with a bigger mix of original tunes - instead of just one, the opening song, Alive - to showcase Im's individual musical style would have made this a more memorable outing.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nBritney Spears\n\nBritney Jean\n\nBritney Spears marks her foray into her 30s with Britney Jean, her most personal album to date with the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning pop star taking on producing and co-writing duties. But the slick and contemporary R&B tunes sound too young for a soccer mum her age to be making and the songs also lack the pop sheen and hook of her earlier works. The result is a very average and generic electro-pop album with hardly any standout tracks and the lead single, Work B*tch, pricks ears only because of its controversial title. In it, Spears sings about working harder but ironically, she doesn't practise what she preaches in this largely disappointing effort.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such is how China's worsening environmental crisis has become good news for a spectrum of environment-related companies in Singapore and abroad.\n\nBusinesses in pollution control, renewable energy and manufacture of environmental protection equipment are eager to lend a helping hand, lured in part by a breathtaking investment of over three trillion yuan (S$628 billion) by President Xi Jinping's administration to combat the country's infamous air and water pollution. This was announced last July as part of the country's 12th five-year plan (2011-2015).\n\nThe government's more stringent air and water discharge standards is another plus, as power plants, steel mills, chemical factories and other pollutive industries in China scamper to call on the expertise of environmental companies for help.\n\n\"We are at a blowout, it's time to explode. The demand totally outstrips the supply,\" Singapore-listed China Environment's executive chairman, Huang Min, said.\n\nToo-rapid urbanisation and industrialisation have taken their toll on China's environment - a \"sacrifice\" not uncommon for developing economies. \"China is paying an old debt,\" Mr Huang added.\n\nThe government is still gradually releasing details of its environmental plan.\n\nSo far, it has increased subsidies to power plants that install equipment to limit their emission of air pollutants, and vowed to punish those who are equipped to filter air contaminants but do not do so. Coal-based power plants contribute majorly to China's air pollution.\n\nThe 12th five-year plan has also earmarked 430 billion yuan (up 17 per cent from the 11th year) for newly added pipelines as well as wastewater and sludge treatment facilities.\n\nThis mainly supports the municipal wastewater sector. Insufficient funds and an underdeveloped piping network and sludge disposal systems have restricted the capacity of their treatment facilities.\n\n\"It is infrastructure budget. The money from the central government flows to the municipal governments. When they have the funds to spend on all these projects to build or upgrade their treatment plants, it means projects for us to bid and win,\" explained United Envirotech (UEL) executive director Chong Weng Chiew.\n\nTo take advantage of the regulatory wave, companies from Singapore have entered the Chinese market to offer what as a global hydrohub Singapore has long been good at - offering water management expertise.\n\nChinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public and private domestic companies and other foreign players have likewise jumped onto the bandwagon - with varying successes.\n\nOn Singapore's stock exchange, a handful of companies which provide environment-related services in China have seen their stock prices soar on rising revenues.\n\nIndustrial waste gas treatment firm China Environment, also the third largest player in China's air pollution control market, is now trading at six times what it was a year ago.\n\nStock prices of water treatment firms SIIC Environment and UEL have doubled over the past year, while the share price of Beijing-based HanKore Environment recently leapt on news of a reverse takeover by Chinese SOE China Everbright.\n\nIt is not just a short burst of energy that will soon enough dissipate. Environmental firms expect this positive run to last anywhere between one to two decades.\n\nFive years is too short, the pollution too severe, and it is simply \"political suicide\" to stop supporting environmental protection measures, they say. In fact, some think new funding may be unveiled as early as the upcoming National People's Congress's session in March.\n\nUEL's Dr Chong said: \"This is only the beginning. I won't be surprised if they dedicate more to spend in the next five-year plan.\"\n\nFunding also does not end with the building of treatment plants; maintaining their operations thereafter also requires funds, for instance to upgrade their technology and improve their productivity, he added.\n\nRecent years have also seen private-equity (PE) firms, venture capital investors and hedge funds placing their bets on the sector. Last year, for instance, PE firms such as RRJ Capital, China Investment Corp and Shanghai Industrial Holdings poured US$1.2 billion into companies related to China's environmental industry, according to Asia Private Equity Review.\n\nGiven the thronging of investors in the sector, competition is unavoidable. The playing field is very fragmented with hundreds of players.\n\nThe major players continue to be state-owned or controlled enterprises whose influence can extend well beyond their cities of origin across entire regions. Competitive labour costs, vertical integration and stronger governmental support give them this advantage.\n\nThere are also foreign companies, mostly American and European, which partner Chinese firms to combine capital and expertise in bidding for projects - crucial, given that it is such a technology-driven industry.\n\nNasdaq-listed air pollution control firm Fuel Tech is one example. It earns one-fifth of its revenue from China. General Electric, Mitsubishi Rayon and Siemens rank among the major foreign water pollution control companies.\n\nBut working in such close proximity with locals also carries the risk of foreign companies exposing their technology to a people known to be exceptional \"copycats\" and emulators of foreign products and techniques.\n\nAir cleaner company Utopia Aire set up office in Shanghai in 2002 but left four years later, citing as one of its reasons such \"free tuition\" that the locals were trying to obtain from it by making detailed enquiries of its technologies under the pretence of looking for a contractor, managing director Jeremy Chia told BT.\n\nTo prevent copying was also why UEL decided to acquire membrane maker Memstar to vertically integrate its processes, as well as manufacture its newest generation of fibres in Singapore - to protect its intellectual property and patent, for added precaution.\n\nCultural differences leading to the problems in expectations, practice and pace also pose a problem.\n\n\"It takes time to gain deeper understanding into the country's issues and develop suitable processes, methodologies and service delivery skills,\" said Tan Shao Yen, managing director of CPG Consultants.\n\nThe company entered Suzhou, China in 2001 and said it has been seeing growing demand for its expertise in green architectural and environmental infrastructural design of late.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The film, directed by Brian Percival and based on the 2006 book of the same name by Markus Zusak, starts with a death, is narrated by Death himself and ends in tragic circumstances. Yet there is an oddly uplifting quality to this morality tale because as the Big D is quick to remind us, nobody ever outruns him in the end - so why sweat it?\n\n\"My advice is, when the time comes, don't panic - it doesn't seem to help,\" says Death in the kindly, dulcet tones of an old family friend. Casting mortality in a favourable light isn't the only unusual aspect of The Book Thief, which is about a brave young girl in a small German town during a time of turmoil and suffering.\n\nThe filmmakers appear to have covered the story in a layer of fairy dust - the kind you might find in a Disney family movie. As a result, there is a strange disconnect between the mood of the film and the subject it portrays. For instance, the children in The Book Thief are rosy-cheeked, cheerful and, if not exactly the picture of good health, seemingly immune to the harsh times. And while it would be disrespectful to describe the Holocaust as anything less than a crime against humanity, the film treats the topic with kid gloves, glossing over it in a few obligatory scenes.\n\nThe focus of the film is Liesel (Sophie Nelisse), a pig-tailed 12-year-old who is fostered out in 1938 to the Hubermanns, a middle-aged couple living in small-town Germany. Her new mother Rosa (Emily Watson) is unsmiling and unsympathetic while papa Hans (Geoffrey Rush) plays good cop, making Liesel the apple of his eye. He plays cheery tunes on the accordion and teaches her how to read.\n\nBooks are in short supply because many of them have been deemed by the Nazis to be contrary to German nationalism, but Liesel develops a literary thirst - one she tries to quench with regular visits to the mayor's home. There, the mayor's wife (Barbara Auer), still grief-stricken by the death of her own child, invites Liesel to immerse herself in the home's extensive library.\n\nThe mayor eventually stops this cosy arrangement but Liesel sneaks into the library to \"borrow\" books anyway. Her partner in crime is Rudy (Nico Liersch), a soccer-mad classmate whose blond hair and baby blues make him an obvious symbol of the Aryan master race but who is, in fact, a loyal buddy and protector to Liesel.\n\nAt home, Liesel has a secret friend in Max (Ben Schnetzer), a Jewish man who is given refuge by the Hubermanns. He hides in the dank and chilly basement, where Liesel describes the world outside and reads to him when he falls ill.\n\n\"Words are life,\" he says to her. The Book Thief, however, is mostly lifeless.\n\nThe film is an all-round lightweight, soppy in parts and disappointingly one-dimensional. The central message - that innocent children grow up fast in times of war - is apt, but it is not matched by the delivery.\n\n\"I want to grow up before I die,\" says Rudy, who is brave beyond his years - and not one to panic either.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closer to the ground, developers are preparing for a shortage of space.\n\nInvestors including Blackstone Group LP, the world's biggest buyout firm, Brookfield Office Properties Inc and Land Securities Group Plc, the UK's largest real estate investment trust, are looking for well-worn office buildings from the 1980s and early 1990s to buy and refurbish, as rising demand and a shortage of prime space in the City lift prices and rents.\n\n\"If the bricks and bones of buildings are of sufficient quality, we reposition the product and benefit from the supply and demand story,\" James Lock, a managing director at Blackstone's real estate unit, said.\n\nThe 2008 credit crisis caused development to stall in the City, leaving few options for companies seeking large offices in the centre of the financial district. Only six developments have as much as 100,000 square feet available to occupy over the next 12 months, according to Chris Vydra, an executive director at broker CBRE Group Inc. Space sought in the area rose 15 per cent in the six months through November, broker Knight Frank LLP said.\n\nDevelopers that started office towers in 2010 have leased most of the space before the buildings are completed. The 20 Fenchurch Street tower, a Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group project nicknamed the Walkie Talkie, is 64 per cent leased, with tenants including RSA Insurance Group Plc and units of Liberty Mutual Insurance Co, and deals for another 23 per cent awaiting legal approval, according to the companies. British Land Co and Oxford Properties Group Inc said they have agreements for more than half of the Leadenhall Building, known as the Cheesegrater, ahead of completion in the middle of this year.\n\nInvestors that upgrade existing properties and retain the basic shape can put offices on the market about six months faster than they could by constructing a new building, consulting firm EC Harris LP said, using the example of a 200,000 square-foot project. A property of that size would be large enough for about 1,850 workers, broker Savills Plc estimated.\n\nHelical Bar Plc, a London-based developer, and Crosstree Real Estate Partners bought office properties at 207 Old Street on the fringe of the City two years ago. Refurbishment began in January after the investors determined that they wouldn't have to demolish the buildings and start from scratch. Helical Bar expects to make a profit of at least \u00a320 million (S$41.3 million) from its 33 per cent stake in the \u00a3180 million project, development director Gerald Kaye said.\n\nRenovating \"is generally much cheaper in terms of money and time, and you don't have to have a huge debate with the planners\", Mr Kaye said. \"If you can turn around a refurbishment quickly, then you're well placed to capitalise.\"\n\nAt 20 Old Bailey, across the street from the courthouse where writer Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency in 1895, Blackstone plans \"a complete refurbishment of the space, taking it back to the frame, and the introduction of a best-in-class building,\" Mr Lock said.\n\nLeadenhall Court, a seven-floor structure built in 1988 and bought by Brookfield in 2012, will either be renovated or redeveloped - demolished and replaced by a new structure built on the same site - by the New York-based company when the lease expires, spokeswoman Carlin Fier said. The property is close to the Lloyd's of London building, the centre of the city's insurance industry, and is leased to Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Plc.\n\n\"The place to hunt for ourselves and others is that shorter-term income bracket where we can asset manage or refurbish and redevelop buildings,\" Martin Jepson, a senior vice-president at Brookfield, said. \"That's the strategy people will naturally look for when there's low supply.\" Viewings by potential tenants at 99 Bishopsgate, redeveloped in 1995, doubled after Brookfield spent \u00a35 million upgrading the lobby, terraces and common areas in October, Mr Jepson said. The office building near Liverpool Street railway station has 60,000 square feet of vacant space.\n\n\"I'll be disappointed if we don't see this leased up in the early part of the year,\" he said.\n\nSpeed is the key. Investors who now start refurbishing or constructing new buildings run the risk of greater competition arriving on the market before the work is finished.\n\n\"People have to get in and out and do refurbs before anyone sees the potential for oversupply, which will come,\" Tom Elliott, head of City investment at Land Securities, said. The company is also looking for buildings that can be upgraded, he said.\n\nThe amount of new space completed in 2012 was the lowest in more than 25 years, Deloitte Real Estate said in a May report. About 1 million square feet was delivered in 2013, twice the level of a year earlier, according to CBRE.\n\nCompetition for older buildings to renovate is pushing up selling prices. Blackstone agreed to pay more than \u00a390 million to Mitsui Fudosan Co, Japan's largest developer, for 20 Old Bailey, according to two people with knowledge of the deal who asked not to be named because the details are private. That's about \u00a310 million more than the offer price, one of the people said. Blackstone and Mitsui Fudosan declined to comment on the price.\n\nHenderson Group Plc, another London-based developer and property investor, is becoming more selective in choosing refurbishment opportunities because of the increased competition in the market, director of property Nick Deacon said.\n\nRising demand spurred by an improving UK economy will probably lead to rent increases of at least 10 per cent a year in the district through 2016, Goldman Sachs Group Inc real estate analysts including Julian Livingstone-Booth said in a note to clients last month.\n\nThe prospect of higher rents is attracting buyers, especially from overseas, for prime office space in the City. That's pushing up prices and increasing the reward for developers that refurbish buildings and secure tenants. Yields for prime properties in the City fell to 4.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent in the year through September, indicating an increase in values, Knight Frank said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The main gripe was the rising cost of living.\n\nOn another level, the government also has to contend with a by-election scheduled for March 23. The by-poll was triggered by the resignation of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) assemblyman Lee Chin Cheh on Jan 27.\n\nMr Lee resigned to pave the way for opposition leader and PKR adviser Anwar Ibrahim to run and, if victorious, replace the state's current mentri besar, Khalid Ibrahim.\n\nAccording to a senior PKR official who spoke to BT, Mr Khalid is \"clean but so tight-fisted that the state's maintenance is being ignored\". Mr Anwar is seen as the only choice acceptable to the Selangor PKR.\n\nBut whether the government's concession on the toll rates will have any effect on the by-election's outcome is doubtful.\n\nIn the May 2013 general election, Mr Lee won by a majority of over 6,000 votes and the general consensus is that Mr Anwar should win comfortably.\n\nOn another level, the amount of compensation Putrajaya will have to pay the toll concessionaires has once again sparked debate on the lopsided nature of privatisation agreements.\n\n\"The government must find ways to renegotiate the concession agreements,\" opposition lawmaker Gobind Singh Deo said in a press statement. \"There should be limits on profit margins for these contracts, their duration, and if there are none, then Parliament should legislate to provide for it.\"\n\nMr Muhyiddin had said that the compensation would be for concessionaires in the Klang Valley which were supposed to have raised their toll rates this year.\n\nThe deputy premier said there were several other concessionaires including Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan (Plus) which would not be increasing their toll rates.\n\n\"There are altogether 29 highway concessionaires, but only the ones in the Klang Valley are involved (getting compensation),\" Mr Muhyiddin said. \"If I'm not mistaken, there are nine of them.\"\n\nPerhaps mindful of the debate, the deputy premier added that the Works Ministry would be asked to do a comprehensive study on the existing toll concessions in a long-term context, to see whether there was a way to renegotiate with the concessionaires on toll collection.\n\n\"If there are terms that both sides can agree upon, including extending the concession period as a means to ensure that toll rates will not be raised in future, these can be discussed,\" he told reporters.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now you're trapped in this room, and you have just one hour to escape before your captor comes back - starting now.\n\nIf you recognise this spiel, then you are no stranger to the \"escape room\" - the latest in reality game entertainment that's spawned a mini industry in Singapore.\n\nFrom just one or two operators offering such fantasy role-playing scenarios in the middle of last year, there are now no less than 10 independent companies - some with multiple outlets - and more are being added.\n\nThe escape room concept is simple - for $20-plus a person, you and your friends are locked in a themed room filled with clues and puzzles you need to solve in order to escape within the given time frame of up to one hour. It's a real-life adaptation of similar computer games such as Escape The Room, in which a player is locked in a virtual room with the same objective.\n\nOne of the pioneers to introduce the live version of the game is The Escape Artist (T.E.A.), which opened its first outlet at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre in April last year. It's run by three friends who wanted to bring the game to Singapore after trying it out for themselves in Shanghai.\n\n\"At the time when we first opened, we were worried that it was quite a risky business,\" says one of the founders, Justin Lee, who left his job as an engineer with the Singapore Air Force to run it full-time. His two partners have kept their day jobs.\n\n\"Because we did it so early, there was almost no exposure to this game concept yet, so we didn't know if it would work. A lot of people even asked us: 'Why would I pay you so much money to lock me up?'\"\n\nGrowing interest\n\nTheir first outlet eventually did prove to be a success, however. After starting out with just 20 to 50 customers a week, Mr Lee, 29, estimates that the number has increased almost tenfold. While his clientele comprises mainly young working adults in the 20-something-to-35 age range, half of his company's revenue comes from corporate clients. They come in large groups of at least 20 to 30 people as part of their corporate bonding activities.\n\nMr Lee also reckons that the growing interest in escape rooms is a natural extension of computer gaming, and also due to the limited options for a night out in Singapore. \"The entertainment scene here is quite boring at the moment. When you go out you just go to the park, to a pub, or watch a movie. This is different because it's something new, and you don't get to experience it anywhere else.\"\n\nTheir success gave Mr Lee and his partners enough confidence to fork out even more money - almost $100,000 - for a second outlet last November. This new outlet, called The Escape Artist: Adventures, cost them twice the amount of money than the first one, especially since it is located at a more central and expensive space on Prinsep Street.\n\nAt this new outlet, players are no longer locked in just one room and tasked with finding a key to unlock the door. Instead, there is a physical progression where they must open multiple doors to explore new spaces before being able to escape.\n\nThough he prefers not to reveal actual figures, Mr Lee says both investments are already breaking even and have started to rake in profits at a slow but steady pace.\n\nT.E.A. is not the only one attracting corporate clients with deeper pockets than the average individual, in search of a novel team building experience.\n\nAnother game provider, Freeing SG, has also seen at least 70 per cent of non-peak customers and 30 per cent of overall customers coming from companies who use their facilities for corporate events.\n\nFreeing SG comes from one of the earliest brands of the Hong Kong escape room game called Freeing HK, which opened in 2012 and currently has about five outlets there.\n\nAccording to Freeing SG's general manager John Teng, 30, the investors behind the Singapore outlet are mostly businessmen from various industries who prefer not to be named. Almost all of them have tried the game overseas and believed this concept would be popular in Singapore.\n\nAlthough he declines to reveal the total amount spent to bring Freeing SG to Singapore, Mr Teng says no expense was spared when it came to renovating their almost 6,000 square feet of space on the rooftop of Bugis+.\n\nFor example, they built more elaborate decorations such as walls made of real bricks instead of wallpaper, and used more advanced technology such as a laser maze and smoke machines.\n\nHe adds: \"We invested a lot in our R&D, which includes customised electrical, electronics and mechanical engineering, designs and fabrication which don't come cheap.\"\n\nIt's certainly paid off in terms of attracting interest, especially from the corporate sector. Wong Kian Lin, an engineer with an oil and chemical MNC, organised an escape room session for his company's new hires as part of a bonding session. Other departments got wind of it and organised their own sessions. In the end, almost 140 employees took part over four separate occasions, raking up a bill of over $5,400.\n\nSays Mr Wong, 25: \"I thought the game was a good icebreaker and team building activity. There is a feeling of adventure that comes from solving all the clues in the room plus a huge sense of satisfaction after you manage to escape.\"\n\nBut like all activities, escape rooms have also gained quite a following that include some diehard fans who don't mind spending relatively large sums of money on it.\n\nAn example is financial planning manager Desmond Lee, 31, who has spent at least $500 over the last six months playing close to 20 different escape rooms.\n\nNot only does he intend to try every room in Singapore, he also hopes to one day fly to Hong Kong and have a go at their games as well.\n\nTo him, the games have been worth every cent because they were real experiences that transported him to a different world. \"You feel like you're in a computer game or movie, and I like that it is so challenging. I've played the online versions but those are so different from real life,\" explains Mr Lee.\n\nWeighing in on this growing trend is psychologist Daniel Koh of Insights Mind Centre, who agrees that the attraction of these reality escape games come from the new dimension that is introduced when compared to traditional games.\n\n\"Instead of the traditional hand-eye coordination shooting games, being locked up gives a sense of thrill which makes the goal most fulfilling. The time limit is also a factor in heightening the thrill, and interesting designs and problems are attractive too. They make the game realistic, alive and active,\" he says.\n\nAs more game providers continue to spring up, competition gets stiffer and like everything else in this digital age, concepts need to be constantly updated in order to stay attractive to consumers.\n\nOne of the newest kids on the block is The Phantom Joker, which opened on Neil Road less than three weeks ago. Its founders are 10 university graduates in their late 20s, who first started with the online game before trying the real-life version in China.\n\n\"We are all fans of escape games, both the computer version and real-life ones,\" says director Alvin Yuan, 27. \"Every time we played those other games, we always thought we could do it better. So why not try?\" he adds.\n\nAlthough most of their game story ideas are bought over from the more established companies in China, The Phantom Joker still takes care to make it its own in the technical aspect, by using more sophisticated mechanisms than just physical locks.\n\nWithout giving anything away, Mr Yuan demonstrates how correctly assembling certain items in one part of the room can cause something else on the other other end of the room to automatically react.\n\n\"It's hard to describe it properly, but we always see the players' surprise and amazement. And we'll hear them say repeatedly how it's 'so cool',\" laughs Mr Yuan.\n\nHuge potential\n\nWhile initially reticent about the amount of investment put up by him and his business partners, Mr Yuan eventually reveals that some $150,000 was spent on the startup, including the renovation of the two-storey shophouse space. And this doesn't include the monthly rental of $12,000 for their central location.\n\nAccording to calculations based on $22 per person for off-peak and $28 for peak hours, Mr Yuan estimates that they will need about 500 customers per week in order to stay afloat.\n\nHe remains positive, however, and believes the current market has not yet reached saturation point, so the excitement over this new form of entertainment is unlikely to go down the same path as the bubble tea or doughnut craze.\n\n\"I think there are many players in this business now, but the games can still be improved to give people a higher level of entertainment. So it probably won't be a passing fad. All games are different - old ones will be replaced by new ones. As long as there is a population who enjoys this kind of games, then it will stay,\" he says.\n\nAgreeing with him is John Teng of Freeing SG, who also feels there is still huge potential in the market for this business.\n\n\"The Singapore entertainment industry has been so stagnant for the past few years. . .

Notably, such renewed confidence about growth comes at a time when businesses are being transformed by digital technology.\n\nThese were among the main findings of Accenture and the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) new report, CEO Briefing 2014 - The Global Agenda: Competing in a Digital World, which also has found that businesses which are able to properly focus their digital business investments will be the ones to make the most of such growth.\n\nThe EIU surveyed 1,041 C-suite executives across 20 countries and 12 industries, including Singapore, during the last quarter of 2013. It sought their views on prospects for the global economy and they had bold ambitions for growth, the survey found.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of executives surveyed expect their company's profits to go up over the next 12 months, while 65 per cent plan to increase their workforce. Some 76 per cent are \"somewhat optimistic\" or \"strongly optimistic\" about their own organisation, and 44 per cent feel that way about the global economy.\n\nIn Singapore, half the respondents said they were optimistic about the global economy in 2014; 75 per cent were optimistic about their own organisation's growth; and 56 per cent expressed optimism about the domestic economy.\n\nThe survey also found that business leaders around the world understand the significant impact that digital technologies will have on transforming their industry and the way they do business, but there is a potential disconnect with their actual investments in digital business initiatives.\n\nThe primary focus for investment in digital business by the majority of companies was to improve internal costs and drive productivity gains. They may instead need to place more emphasis on digital business investments related to their growth strategy of developing new products and services for new customers, the report noted.\n\nSingapore executives seem to be ahead of the curve in this respect - 66 per cent of respondents here said they intended to drive growth in their domestic markets in the next three years by focusing on selling new products and services. That proportion greatly exceeds the 34 per cent who say they will prioritise selling existing products.\n\nReflecting this emphasis on new product development is a heightened focus on research and development (R&D), with more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of executives here indicating that their organisations plan to increase their R&D expenditure in 2014 to support innovation efforts.\n\nIn line with this is the Singapore executive's focus on investing in human capital. A majority (73 per cent) said their organisations will increase human capital investment in 2014, much greater than those increasing investment in physical and tangible assets. Some 58 per cent of firms here also expect to grow their workforces this year.\n\nCost challenges are, however, tempering these growth ambitions in Singapore. In contrast to their regional peers, who are mostly concerned with recession in key markets and competition from new market entrants, Singapore executives cited raw material costs and the high cost of capital as the biggest risks facing their companies over the next 12 months. They also rank less expensive labour costs as the most important factor for increasing Singapore's competitiveness.\n\nSaid Jonathan Wright, managing director of Accenture Strategy, Asean: \"There is a demand for a bigger, bolder Singapore ambition if organisations are to continue to thrive here. Our research shows a focus on the domestic market, but companies are also beginning to re-think the role that Singapore plays in their Asean and APAC (Asia-Pacific) portfolios.\n\n\"As Asian markets develop, we are seeing business models and the role of regional headquarters evolving to provide high-value services across the region by leveraging the competitive advantages - stability, highly skilled workforce, developed infrastructure - that the country has to offer.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Or just imagine how America feels - the America that still watches television on television, that is.\n\nWhatever appreciative or insightful words one can muster for Jay Leno's second farewell from NBC's The Tonight Show were pretty much the same words one might have written when Leno left the first time, in 2009.\n\nBut that's how the millennials feel about Generation X, and it's how Generation X feels about the baby boomers: It's crowded in here. You're taking my job from me! (Yeah, well, you're an obstacle to my dreams!) Take a number! (I took a number! They never called it!) Politely sending Leno on his way is like trying to come up with another wedding toast for someone who keeps getting married, or a grocery-store sheet cake for the departing employee who keeps getting rehired as a contractor, or the meaningful eulogy for someone who burst out of the coffin once and might darn well do it again. (Like Leno, I stretch any quip as far as it'll go.)\n\nIn spite of this fatigue - and a permanent indifference to both the real and imagined drama of the \"late-night TV wars\" - I've found it more than possible to appreciate and even savour the sentimental and resigned tone of Leno's final episodes over the past several nights, bringing a close to his 22-year run. (A nearly 22-year run, that is, briefly interrupted by seven months of the unfairly doomed-from-the-start Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien of 2009-10.)\n\nThrough the playfully bitter resistance to retiring this time (a resistance brought into sharper relief a couple of weeks ago during a 60 Minutes interview), Leno has obviously enjoyed these last few nights, bringing on his favourite guests and seeming to have reached an acceptance phase in regard to the passage of time and the mannerly exit.\n\nWhen he signs off on Thursday, the guests will be Billy Crystal (who appeared on Leno's first show on May 25, 1992) and Garth Brooks. He likes to show his guests a clip of their first time on his show; in case their hair or their dewy innocence is too embarrassing, he likes to show them the clip of his first time on Johnny Carson's show, when he was a gawky, shaggy young comedian in a lime-green 1970s suit.\n\nFallon came on Leno's show on Monday night (in advance of taking the show over on Feb 17), and after some (one hopes) good-natured jokes between the two men about the succession process, they both welcomed Betty White, each man offering an arm to the 92-year-old TV actress, who very dearly recounted her experiences with every The Tonight Show host through the decades.\n\nThere seemed in those moments with White to be an implied message to all those Barcalounger viewers who've made The Tonight Show a lifelong habit (in real time, after the local news, rather than in clip form via tweets and status updates the next morning online), and the message was this: Who really cares who hosts The Tonight Show? The point is, it's still on. The point is, you're still on, in the only sense that matters - still awake, still breathing, still able to tell stories about the difference between 1962 and 1978 and 1995 and 2014. Still able to work a remote control and acquire a signal. Be glad about that.\n\nOf course, in this protracted series of goodbyes, it's mostly been jokes about television from people on television - the worst and also easiest kind of banter and punch lines, which so often seem to be the only thing anyone ever talks about on talk shows anymore.\n\nIt's also been a lot of jokes about being tossed to the curb (solid gold curbs on gold-paved streets traversed by an enormous fleet of pricey, collectible, Leno-owned automobiles and motorcycles, but a curb nonetheless). It's been a lot of jokes about Leno coming back to the job once Fallon flunks out. (It can't happen. It won't happen. Please, God, don't let that happen.) These last shows couldn't help but be fraught with the subtext of generational clash, in which the older, esteemed journeyman is retired \"before\" his time (Leno will be 64 in April) in order to make way for the young turk - a conversation you are probably already tired of having at your own workplace.\n\nThe last time we did this, five years ago, the young turk replacing Leno was then 46-year-old Conan O'Brien, who is now 51; Fallon is 39. And Fallon's replacement on NBC's Late Night, Seth Meyers, is 40; CBS's David Letterman is 66 and the Late Late Show's Craig Ferguson is 51; ABC's Jimmy Kimmel is 46; Comedy Central's Jon Stewart is 51 and Stephen Colbert is 49.\n\nSo when we talk about what's on television in America after 11 o'clock at night, we can't honestly say that it's a discussion about the young versus the old - none of these guys are technically young (and, it should be noted, none of them are minorities or women). What we're really having is a longer and more complicated conversation about what's funny now and how we prefer to watch it. Live? Clipped? Not at all?\n\nO'Brien was and still is (on his little-discussed TBS talk show) demonstrably funnier than Leno when the measurement is irony.\n\nFallon is demonstrably funnier than both O'Brien and Leno when the measurement is insouciance and on-point satire of fame and pop culture.\n\nKimmel is funnier than the three of them when the measurement is a prankish knack for using the Internet - which is undeniably important and now commonly seen as the key to survival.\n\nLetterman is funnier than anyone if and only if the measurement is self-deprecation and faux-naivete. (And Stewart and Colbert are funnier if and only if the audience sample is skewed by people still angry about the Bush years.) But what I've enjoyed most about Leno's last shows is that all the measuring seems more and more a moot point.\n\nThe late-night wars are never over, but they seem to matter a whole lot less to us pop-culture civilians. What still matters to network executives and advertisers matters less to the rest of us, who are more keenly aware of a larger change in the air. Worrying about late-night TV ratings feels like reading old headlines. We're saying goodbye to a lot when Leno goes, but I still believe that we're saying hello to something better, fresher, faster. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

It can be zero in January and change to big numbers in the next few months,\" he said.\n\nThe report also showed that resale prices gained a marginal 0.3 per cent in January, thwarting the general decline in monthly prices since April 2013. This was based off an estimated 893 transactions in January, a 34.6 per cent year-on-year drop.\n\nDespite the reversal in price trends, it might be too hasty to assume that prices are bottoming out given that the prices are based on a limited number of transactions and are thus susceptible to wild swings, said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research. Indeed, Mr Ong expects that there is still potential for prices to fall by about 5 per cent in the first half of this year before starting to stabilise.\n\n\"This monthly volatility is exacerbated by uncertainty in the HDB resale market following the implementation of the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) in August, compounded by the different types of flats transacted between months,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nFor instance, the rise in average prices could be due to increased interest in smaller sized flats due to the MSR cap limiting large loans, he suggested.\n\nSeparately, the report also showed that almost three in 10 HDB deals closed below valuation.\n\nBased on transaction records from SRX member agencies, 28.5 per cent of HDB resale deals were closed below valuation in January, compared with 20.4 per cent in December. January's number is also higher than the previous high of 26.0 per cent in April 2009.\n\nLooking ahead, Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Singapore said he expects to see more deals closed below valuation as sellers become more realistic. That being said, flats with good attributes, such as being located close to an MRT station, should be able to hold their prices reasonably well, he qualified.\n\nThere should also be a pick-up in transaction volume after the Chinese New Year festivities.\n\n\"Transaction volume in March, April, and May are likely to set the pace for the rest of the year,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nOn the rental front, an estimated 1,319 HDB flats were rented in January, 6.8 per cent less than December's 1,415 transactions. Rents stayed constant at $2,300 in January after two consecutive monthly drops in November and December.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be the company's first manufacturing facility in Asia, and is expected to be fully operational by 2019.\n\nAbbVie, formed in 2013 after its separation from Abbott Laboratories, produces some of the world's best- selling drugs including Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment with annual sales of about US$15 billion.\n\nWhen AbbVie's plant is completed, the Republic will have 29 pharmaceutical plants, nine of which will be involved in making biologics.\n\nBiologics, or drugs harvested from living cells, account for about one-third of AbbVie's pipeline.\n\nThe plant will be the first in Singapore that combines both biologics and small molecules, or chemical-based drug manufacturing, in a single facility. AbbVie has 12 manufacturing sites globally, including the US and Europe.\n\nThe company is looking to increase manufacturing capacity to support a product pipeline it reckons is \"the strongest it has ever been\".\n\nAbbVie plans to hire more than 250 people for the plant, which will produce drugs for the global market for use in cancer and immunology treatments.\n\nAzita Saleki-Gerhardt, AbbVie's senior vice-president (operations), said Singapore's stable manufacturing environment, collaboration opportunities, educated workforce and track record of receiving global regulatory approval influenced the company's decision to locate the plant here.\n\nAs more companies enter Singapore or expand their operations here, output from the pharmaceutical sector will become more diversified and less volatile, noted Kevin Lai, director of Biomedical Sciences and Consumer Business at the Economic Development Board (EDB).\n\nEDB said that excluding AbbVie's investment, the biologics sector has attracted about S$2.4 billion worth of investments over the past seven years. The sector employs about 1,700 people, and up to 1,000 jobs are expected to be added over the next 3-4 years.\n\nMr Lai believes there will be more biologics- based drugs in the research and development pipelines of drug companies in future.\n\nTo develop talent in the biologics cluster, EDB plans to partner a local university to develop a degree programme in pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He will be working under the direction of well-known opera singer- actor Neil Rosenshein, who also tutors him when he is in New York for the school holidays.\n\nHis father, Koh Chye Hock, was the one who persuaded Rosenshein to coach Corey in the first place. He explains: \"When Corey first became interested in singing, we got him a teacher here in Singapore. But later on when he became serious, we realised there wasn't much Singapore could offer him to take him to a professional world level. So we had to look elsewhere.\n\n\"Initially, Rosenshein wasn't interested because he said he didn't take students so young. But after some correspondence, he agreed to listen to the tape to see if Corey was good enough. So we sent a tape, and he eventually changed his mind. At that time, Corey was only 10,\" adds Mr Koh, an in-house lawyer with Chevron.\n\nAccording to him, Corey's first performance goes back as far as when he was two years old, when the family was living in Bangladesh for a period of time. Mr Koh was invited to sing at a concert and would have regular practice sessions at home, during which Corey would listen in.\n\nOn the night of the concert, even without officially learning the lyrics, Corey took the microphone from his father and sang two songs \"pitch perfect\" in front of a crowd of 500 - entirely in Bengali.\n\nSince then, he has also performed at multiple iconic performance venues around the world, including Carnegie Hall in New York, Suntory Hall in Tokyo, and even Singapore's Marina Bay Sands Theatre last December as part of the annual ChildAid charity concert organised by The Straits Times and The Business Times.\n\nBut being a child opera singer is not always as straightforward as it seems - in fact, it takes a lot of discipline for someone his age to take proper care of his vocal chords.\n\nFor example, he refrains from drinking iced drinks, and stays away from fried snacks and chocolates, save for the rare treat at McDonald's every once in a while.\n\n\"All these things can easily hurt my throat. And if anything has even a one per cent chance of damaging my voice, then no way am I going near it,\" says Corey determinedly.\n\nCorey Koh will perform with The Philharmonic Winds at the Esplanade Concert Hall on April 6 at 5pm. Tickets can be bought from Feb 13, at $15 each, with various packages and concessions available. Log on to\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg\n\nfor more information or to buy tickets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The data excludes voters in nine provinces where voting could not take place.\n\nPolls were disrupted in 18 per cent of constituencies, 69 out of 375, nationwide, affecting 18 out of 77 provinces.\n\nAnti-government protests are still blocking parts of Bangkok in the latest round of an eight-year dispute that broadly pits Bangkok's middle class, southern Thais and the royalist establishment against the mostly poor, rural supporters of Ms Yingluck and her brother, ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nTen people have been killed in sporadic bursts of violence, although Bangkok has been calm since the vote. The number of protesters on the streets has dwindled, for now, but their three-month campaign has drawn as many as 200,000 on big marches and rallies, more of which are expected. The protests are having an impact on the economy, the tourism sector in particular with arrivals in Bangkok sharply down.\n\n\"People are very concerned about their future,\" Thanavath Phonvichai, an economics professor at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC), told a news conference for the release of the university's latest confidence survey which showed that the country's consumer confidence dropped for a 10th straight month in January.\n\nThe prolonged political crisis is making Thais reluctant to spend, adding to the country's economic problems. The consumer confidence index calculated by the UTCC slid to 71.5 in January, the lowest level since November 2011, from 73.4 in December. A UTCC statement said consumption \"is likely to fall further at least until late in the second quarter because the economy is slowing and there is no sign of recovery yet. . . Confidence should pick up once the political situation eases but it's not clear when that will happen\".\n\nMeanwhile, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban faces charges of murder related to violence in 2010 when, as deputy prime minister, he sent in troops to crush protests by \"red shirt\" supporters of Thaksin. More than 90 people were killed.\n\nSuthep was to appear in court yesterday in that case, but he failed to turn up for a second time. He was given another seven days to appear.\n\nThe court initially requested Suthep to appear on Dec 12 last year but rescheduled the hearing for six weeks later, citing his lack of availability due to his anti-government campaign. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The UBS Swiss Real Estate Bubble Index rose to 1.23 points in the fourth quarter from 1.2 points in the third, according to a statement from UBS AG yesterday. A reading above 2 indicates a bubble.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank's policy of zero rates, in place since August 2011, has kept down the cost of taking out a mortgage. Coupled with high immigration from neighbouring European countries, that has fuelled a strong increase in real estate prices in Switzerland.\n\nGrowth in mortgages has exceeded that of economic output since 2009, and last year price gains of homes and apartments outstripped advances in incomes, according to the central bank.\n\n\"The potential for correction has increased further,\" Matthias Holzhey and Claudio Saputelli at UBS in Zurich said.\n\nSwitzerland could fall victim to a real estate crisis similar to that of the 1990s - the government last year forced banks to build up a countercyclical buffer of one per cent of mortgage-related assets. After that failed to prevent a further deterioration of the mortgage market, it last month doubled the requirement to 2 per cent.\n\nEven so, it refrained from raising it to the maximum 2.5 per cent. Banks have until June 30 to comply. Tackling property-market imbalances via interest rates is not an option for the authorities at the moment. The benchmark interest rate must stay at zero so as not to jeopardise the cap of 1.20 per euro set on the Swiss franc in 2011, SNB vice-president Jean-Pierre Danthine said this month.\n\nRates for fixed-rated mortgages rose in 2013, according to the barometer published by Comparis for the fourth quarter, with the average price 35 per cent higher than in 2012. The rate for a 10-year fixed rate mortgage increased to 2.7 per cent from 2 per cent, it said.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

But the airline loses 700,000 euros a day and has net debt of more than 800 million euros. Alitalia completed a 300 million euro capital hike in December, which analysts said then would keep it flying for six months.\n\nWhile Italy's government has said it is optimistic about a possible deal, analysts said an agreement was far from certain and expect tough negotiations on debt and additional cost cuts in the weeks ahead.\n\nEtihad will want to make sure that neither Rome's politicians nor Italy's notoriously feisty unions stand in the way of a joint strategy in the future.\n\n\"Etihad doesn't want to have anything to do with Italian unions and will make sure that a deal with labour groups is found before it comes in,\" Andrea Giuricin, chief executive of TRA Consulting, said.\n\nChronic political interference in Alitalia, which Rome considers a national strategic asset, has been a major obstacle in previous negotiations between Alitalia and foreign bidders.\n\nBut with other potential suitors few and far between, analysts said Alitalia - and ultimately Italy - may have to negotiate on Etihad's terms. \"If the talks with Etihad break down, I don't see any other alternative than Alitalia going to the wall,\" said Carlo Stagnaro, head of research at think-tank Bruno Leoni Institute.\n\nRivals Easyjet and Ryanair are also using the weakness of Alitalia to expand aggressively in Italy, making life more difficult for any investor.\n\nThe competition on the shorter, point-to-point routes means Etihad will focus on long-haul, should it invest in Alitalia.\n\nEtihad's stake-building strategy and its code shares with Air France-KLM also call into doubt the future of the traditional airline alliances - Star Alliance, OneWorld and SkyTeam, groupings that Etihad's Mr Hogan has described as\"fractured.\"\n\n\"What role the alliances will play in the future is unclear, but it looks like it is a business model that will not last in its current form,\" Tanja Wielgoss, Berlin-based partner at consultancy AT Kearney, said. \"We see a tendency towards more focus on growing organically or via acquisitions.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/24ce6de1e5df319d75257118f16981d2509bdd88b15bdb6d7ec7f9e9bfbb3e0d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Ready to fly: Etihad and Alitalia are in the final stages of due diligence and sources close to the matter say that a deal could involve Etihad buying a 40 per cent stake for as much as 300 million euros. -\u00a0FILE PHOTO"}]}

The 2014 Winter Olympics, which cost about US$50 billion, are the single biggest infrastructure investment since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nFor President Vladimir Putin, that was part of a push to boost the economy of the whole North Caucasus region and an attempt to improve the way Russia is viewed around the world.\n\nSochi, which will host the Feb 7-23 event, lies to the west of the Caucasus mountains, which stretch about 1,200km across Chechnya to Dagestan on the Caspian Sea, one of Russia's most economically distressed regions.\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in southern cities killed more than 30 people in December, Mr Putin, an avid skier, took to the slopes near Sochi to assure athletes, officials and spectators the Olympics will be safe.\n\nMr Putin sealed off Sochi in January and deployed 40,000 police and special service officers around the city, which has a population of 345,000.\n\nAeroflot said in December that it will freeze economy class fares from Moscow to Sochi at 5,000 roubles (S$182) for a round trip in a move to increase sales during the games.\n\n\"What the company is really looking for is the long-term benefit from the games,\" said Andrey Shenk, an analyst at research firm Investcafe LLC. \"It's a matter of expanding its customer base worldwide. Thousands of foreigners will see what Aeroflot is and they'll buy its tickets in the future.\"\n\nYandex will see a boost in revenue from the Olympics due to more advertising during the games, according to Maksim Yurin, the social-media and marketing director at Moscow-based advertising agency Red Keds. The Hague-based company makes most of its revenue from online advertising.\n\n\"Everyone will be online during the Olympics,\" Mr Yurin said. \"People will be checking scores online, reading news online and inevitably clicking on ads, and that will have a positive effect on Yandex's revenue.\"\n\nThe biggest companies involved in the most expensive Olympics ever have underperformed Russia's benchmark stock gauge.\n\nUnited Co Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer, slumped 33 per cent in the past 12 months, while bridge and road builder OAO Mostotrest slid 35 per cent and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel fell 8.8 per cent on concern they will lose money on their Olympics contracts. The Micex Index fell 5.5 per cent in the period.\n\nMost benefits from the construction \"have already been felt\", Moody's said in Wednesday's note. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

In 2012, the government chose Dassault Aviation to supply at least 126 Rafale combat planes after initiating the purchase plan about five years earlier.\n\nA final accord has yet to be signed.\n\nIn January, the nation scrapped a US$753 million deal to buy helicopters from AgustaWestland following a 15-month corruption investigation.\n\n\"India is always going to be a challenge for international players,\" Mr Scherer said.\n\n\"Naturally the defence business has its unique complexities, but I think we understand the Indian system much better today.\"\n\nAirbus will display its C295, as well as radars and missile warning systems at the Defexpo India exhibition in New Delhi starting today.\n\nMore than 600 companies will participate in the four-day event.\n\nAsia's third-largest economy has tripled its military outlay over the past 10 years, and in 2013, the nation had the seventh-largest defence budget in the world.\n\nIndia is increasingly looking beyond Russia to modernise its military, turning to countries including the US to buy arms.\n\nThe country is purchasing 10 C-17 transport planes, valued at about US$5.8 billion, making it the largest operator of the aircraft after the US.\n\nThe country is also buying eight P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft made by Chicago-based Boeing Co as well as six Lockheed Martin Corp C-130J transport aircraft valued at about US$1.2 billion.\n\nIndia in 2012 eased its so-called offset policy to allow more time for foreign defence companies to meet rules.\n\nNorms for mandatory local purchases by overseas suppliers were also relaxed, according to the Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe government is also working to boost local production of defence gear with a goal to raise the proportion of equipment built at home to 75 per cent from about 30 per cent in the next 10 years.\n\nMr Scherer said Airbus provided technical advice through India's Defence Research and Development Organisation on the nation's light combat aircraft project.\n\nThe plane won initial operational clearance in December, paving the way for its induction into service. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

This was due to the successful asset refurbishment programme and the rebalancing of the guest mix to higher yielding market segments.\"\n\nThe Australian hotels closed the quarter with an average occupancy rate of 85.4 per cent and average daily rate (ADR) of A$173, resulting in a RevPAR of A$147 (S$166).\n\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, revenue increased by 10.4 per cent year-on-year, and NPI rose 30.5 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, its hotels in China achieved an average occupancy rate of 80.1 per cent and ADR of 400 yuan, resulting in a RevPAR of 320 yuan (S$67).\n\nThe trust's revenue was further enhanced by the additional steady stream of rental income from the hotels in Japan and Singapore which are operated on master lease contracts.\n\nCompared with its IPO forecast, distributable income was 5.5 per cent better than the $15.8 million predicted in the prospectus.\n\nDPU fell short of the forecast of 1.95 Singapore cents by 17.4 per cent.\n\nNPI beat the projection of $21.8 million by 7.3 per cent, but gross revenue fell short of the expected $60.1 million by 5.9 per cent.\n\nThe poorer-than-expected gross revenue performance was mainly due to the soft economic situation in Australia which resulted in continuing pressure on rates.\n\nAs such, the group's Australia hotels were unable to grow the ADR to the levels projected in the IPO forecast.\n\nRevenue from the China hotels was also below IPO forecast by 1.0 million yuan or 4.1 per cent as the slower economic growth in China dampened demand for accommodation in luxurious hotels.\n\nWhile this resulted in lower revenue from Novotel Beijing, it benefited Ibis, mitigating some of the shortfall from the former.\n\nAs at Dec 31, the trust's gearing ratio was 35.8 per cent, with an interest coverage ratio of 4.9 times and a weighted average interest rate of 3.0 per cent.\n\nA-HTrust's counter rose half a cent to close trading yesterday at 72.5 cents before it released its results.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was boosted by contributions from General Storage Company and Famous Holdings, which were acquired early last year.\n\nThe two businesses were partially responsible for the 64.5 per cent bump in quarterly revenue for the group's logistics division, from $61.5 million to $101.2 million.\n\nSingPost's largest segment, mail, saw a 12.8 per cent increase in revenue which came in at $133.2 million for the quarter, driven by the increase in e-commerce package volumes which in turn boosted domestic and international mail revenue.\n\nExcluding contributions from acquisitions, the growth in revenue stood at 9.3 per cent, driven by growth in e-commerce related activities.\n\nEven so, with the exception of finance expenses, costs rose across the board for the group, resulting in a flat bottom line.\n\nThis increase of 34.4 per cent to $184.4 million in expenses was attributed to \"the change in business model to a diversified group and growth in lower-margin businesses\", said the group.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit inched up 1.8 per cent to $112.3 million, on the back of a 31.8 per cent increase in revenue to $627.8 million.\n\n\"The group is on track with its transformation efforts . . .

The monthly allocation of motorcycle COEs was cut by 25 per cent for the current February to April quota period.\n\nBut it was the strength of the Cat A premium which was the focus of the market. Yesterday's bidding exercise was the first for a re-classified Cat A, which in addition to requiring engine capacity to be 1,600cc or smaller, now limits engine output to 97 kW or 130 hp too. The move is to keep luxury models, which were blamed for soaring premiums, out of this traditional bread-and-butter segment.\n\nCat B is now for cars above 1,600cc or 130 hp.\n\nAs a result, about 40 models have been \"upgraded\" to Cat B, with approximately 100 models left in the newly defined Cat A. One casualty is BMW, which is no longer represented in Cat A. In yesterday's tender, Cat A was one of the first categories to see bidding action, racing to $64,000 with 45 minutes left to the tender close even as the others remained at $1.\n\nBut many in the motor industry had expected Cat A's resilience.\n\n\"Dealers of Japanese and Korean cars have been collecting orders over the past two months in anticipation of the February re-categorisation, so they had to bid strongly,\" said the manager of a European distributor. \"But at this level, few will make money.\"\n\nAs for the lower Cat B premium, he attributed it to weak demand because of the Chinese New Year holiday.\n\n\"But this is only a temporary dip. With more models in Cat B plus a smaller quota, the next round will see premiums go up,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, the manager expects Cat A to eventually soften as dealers raise list prices.\n\nHe explained: \"With higher prices, some prospective Cat A buyers would prefer to look at a Cat B model.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The institute compiles the index monthly, from its survey of more than 150 purchasing managers at manufacturing companies here.\n\nThe electronics PMI also leapt 1.9 points to a January reading of 52 - its largest jump since January 2013. This too was due to more widespread reports of rising new orders and export orders. The electronics production sub-index in particular, hit a reading of 55.2, the highest in more than a year.\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling thinks that the latest readings further confirm that December's PMI was a blip. Then, the gauge had fallen under 50 to a reading of 49.7, indicating contraction. But data released by the Economic Development Board last month diverged from the PMI to show a 6.2 per cent year-on-year, and 5.2 per cent month-on- month, jump in industrial output.\n\nJanuary's readings thus bode well for the domestic manufacturing sector's outlook in the first half of this year, said Ms Ling.\n\nHowever, not all believe that these positive signs will last. Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan said: \"The lead indicators that we track for the region generally show a plateauing in industrial production momentum in Q1. The rise in PMI is probably more reflective of the good industrial production numbers in December, given that the (Singapore) PMIs are generally lagging or at best coincident, rather than leading, indicators.\"\n\nSIPMM executive director Janice Ong said that there has been anecdotal evidence that the political turmoil in Thailand is diverting orders to Singapore's manufacturers. But economists believe that the impact would be slight at best.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan said that the clusters in which such diversion may occur, such as hard disk drives, make up only a small proportion of Singapore's manufacturing sector.\n\nMr Seah agreed: \"I doubt the effect will be sustainable. Thailand still offers substantial cost competitiveness, compared to our local manufacturers.\"\n\nEven the analysts who believe manufacturing has had a strong start in 2014, caution that risks to growth, both external and domestic, remain.\n\n\"There have been mixed signals in the US recovery. Problems in China's financial system have re-emerged with heightened risks involved. While global economic conditions are improving, it won't be a smooth flight to the moon,\" said Mr Seah.\n\nSigns of persistent domestic supply constraints also showed up in the latest PMI report. Employment readings for both overall manufacturing and the electronics sector continued to indicate declines.

Sony is scheduled to report earnings for the October-December quarter today.\n\nSony Corp's plans to quit making personal computers after years of losses focus a spotlight on how it intends to fix a much bigger problem - a flagship TV division that has lost US$7.5 billion over the last 10 years.\n\nThe pullout comes as Japan's electronics firms look for daylight beyond the shadow of industry giants like Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. Exiting the Vaio PC business Sony founded 17 years ago will mark the first time chief executive Kazuo Hirai pulls a major consumer product line.\n\nStill unclear is when Sony can catch up with local peers Panasonic Corp and Sharp Corp on the restructuring track. The pair have swallowed charges, sold off or cured many loss-making businesses, and bounced back to strong profits.\n\nThe reported plan will follow the disposal of assets such as its New York headquarters and a major building in Tokyo last year and could presage Mr Hirai stepping up restructuring efforts, said Macquarie Research analyst Damian Thong.\n\n\"The only way to fund restructuring was to receive funds in deals like this one,\" said Mr Thong. \"And if you look at the last six months, I have to say that this has been the battle strategy that Kaz Hirai has been playing.\"\n\nSony said it had not announced anything about its PC business and that it was exploring various options for the unit.\n\nYesterday Sony's shares rose 4.6 per cent as investors welcomed the news on the Vaio sale. But shares in Panasonic surged 19 per cent after it more than tripled third-quarter operating profit. Sony doesn't break out details of its PC division's financial performance. Analysts estimate its operating loss in the year through March 2014 will be around 30 billion yen (S$375.4 million).\n\nDwarfed by industry giants like Lenovo Group as well as Apple and Samsung, Sony's share of the PC market slipped to 1.9 per cent in 2013 from 2.3 per cent in 2011, according to research firm Gartner.\n\nThe news that Sony is preparing to exit one of its better-known brands will sharpen interest in the performance of the company's TV business when it reports earnings today. Analysts expect a strong showing by Sony's financial services and music businesses to help lift operating profit for the quarter to about 72 billion yen from 46.4 billion yen a year earlier.\n\nIn the first six months of fiscal 2013, Sony's financial unit brought home 85.2 billion yen in operating profit. But Sony logged just 51.1 billion yen in operating profit overall, revealing deep losses for electronic gadgets such as video games, audio equipment and TVs.\n\nCiting losses linked to the sale of the PC business, the Nikkei business daily yesterday reported that Sony could slip into a net loss for the year ending March 31 for the first time in two years.\n\nSony's progress has been hampered by its reliance on consumer electronics. With an array of business-to-business divisions, Panasonic and Sharp have been able to adjust their business models and focus on industrial products, like auto parts, solar panels or energy-efficient housing systems, instead of consumer goods.\n\nHaving last turned an annual operating profit in the 12 months ended March 2004, Sony's TV business has piled up total operating losses of 761.9 billion yen in the meantime.\n\nLike other Sony businesses, Vaio - an acronym for Visual Audio Intelligent Organiser - has seen its thunder stolen by Apple gadgets. The Macbook Pro has eaten up much of the consumer market for sleek, high-end laptops that had become the focus of the Vaio brand. The iPad and other tablets as well as smartphones have also battered consumer demand for PCs overall.\n\nSony has based its fightback on smartphones, PlayStation games, and imaging sensors for mobile devices as well as digital cameras. But analysts have mixed views on their long-term prospects, and many have been frustrated by the slow pace of progress in other businesses. \"One thing is clear, electronics remains a bleeding Achilles' heel,\" said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies in Singapore. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But experts say they are seeing more moms and dads helping their children, especially in the priciest markets. \"It is increasingly common in the city of Toronto, where prices are pressing the limits of affordability, for most buyers looking to get a foot into the market,\" said Steven Fudge, a sales representative at Bosley Real Estate in Toronto. The 25-year industry veteran says that at least 50 per cent of his buyers are bolstered by parental money.\n\nA 2013 survey of 2,000 people for Bank of Montreal found that 27 per cent of first-time buyers in Canada expect their parents or other family members to help them purchase a house.\n\nThat young adults need help with a first home should come as no surprise. Home prices in Canada hit record highs in late 2013, according to the Teranet-National Bank house price index. Industry data showed that the average home price nearing C$400,000 (S$459,400) in December. That's up 10 per cent from a year earlier and 84 per cent from December 2003, when the average price was C$211,768.\n\nWhile the US housing market is still recovering from a collapse in 2008 that triggered the global financial crisis, Canada's market never crashed. Partly that is because prices didn't rise as much during the US boom, as Canadian lenders were more conservative than their US counterparts.\n\nMeanwhile, near record-low interest rates over the past five years have helped fuel gains in prices.\n\nMany forecasters predict a weaker market once borrowing costs begin to climb, and some warn of a US-style crash. For now, though, homebuyers - and parents willing to help them - are plentiful.\n\nJackson Cunningham, a mortgage broker who specialises in first-time homebuyers in Vancouver, Canada's most expensive market, said that some 75 per cent of his clients get help from their parents, typically with the downpayment. \"Most buyers are maxing out their affordability,\" he said.\"There is almost always a downpayment help from the parents. That's very common and completely acceptable at most lenders. Sometimes it is C$20,000, sometimes it is a couple of hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\nHelp from parents to buy property is common in many countries, and Ms Parsons said that her own parents gave her C$1,000 to help her buy a home when she was starting out some 30 years ago. But most observers say it is much more common in Canada.\n\nBenjamin Tal, a senior economist at CIBC World Markets, said that is the result of house prices rising far faster than incomes.\n\nThe overall effect of parental aid on the economy is unclear, he said. While it has helped fuel demand for housing and kept upward pressure on prices, it could dampen consumption if it means the parents have to cut back on their own spending to help their kids.\n\nMost important, Mr Tal said, the wealth of the baby boomers and their willingness to help their offspring likely provide a cushion in case of economic shock that might otherwise prompt a wave of mortgage defaults, and even a housing collapse. \"The increased share of this kind of activity is giving the housing market some more room to manoeuvre in case of an economic shock,\" he said. \"What makes something bad is if it is unsustainable. Is this sustainable? Probably. In fact, it is more stable than anything else that I can think of. So I think it is a good thing.\"\n\nMr Tal and Ms Parsons, herself a mortgage lender for Bank of Montreal, both said that it makes sense for parents to help with the downpayment, leaving the mortgage payments to young home buyers, who would otherwise be paying the same monthly amount in rent. While Canadian house prices are so high as to make downpayments unaffordable, mortgages rates are near historic lows.\n\nBuyers in Canada must put at least 5 per cent down on a home, and can only avoid costly mortgage insurance by putting 20 per cent down.\n\nMr Fudge said that helping the children allows parents to pass on wealth while they are alive, avoiding taxes while getting to see the result of the inheritance. \"It's a strategy on the part of the savvy parents. By gifting the money, most of them are saying to me, 'We don't want our children to have to pay tax on their inheritance. Why am I waiting another 30 years for my kids to get the money when I die, when it can be put to use now?'\"\n\nMs Parsons, who with her husband has given each of their children about C$18,000 to buy or prepare to buy their first homes in Calgary, said that making a downpayment - but not helping with monthly mortgage payments - just makes sense.\n\nBefore her son, a mechanic, bought a house four years ago, she set him up to pay rental income in an apartment that the family owned, training him to get used to a monthly payment. \"To have their own house is the best building block they can start with. My fear is they will rent a lot longer than they should just because of the fear of homeownership,\" she said. \"After all, I can't take it with me when I go.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The average price indication for the 555-unit private condominium in Sengkang is slightly over $1,000 per square foot (psf).\n\nEven amid falling resale prices, Liam Wee Sin, president (property), remains \"quietly optimistic\" about buyer response.\n\nMr Liam says the pricing is realistic because of the $489 price per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) tender bid last year. The neighbouring parcel of land, on which Rivertrees Residences will be built, has a psf ppr of about $533.\n\nHe says that even with the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR), underlying demand to upgrade is still strong. \"If you can produce a product that meets their aspirations and they can afford it, people will still buy,\" he said.\n\nPrices of a one-bedroom unit (495 sq ft) start from $476,000, or around $962 psf. A three-bedroom unit (947 sq ft) starts from $878,000 or $927 psf.\n\nMr Liam expects buyers to come predominantly from the upgrader market, as well as investors who may express interest in smaller units. He added that the pricing for Riverbank is marginally close to that of executive condominiums (ECs) and should also attract some buyers from that market.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle head of South-east Asia research Chua Yang Liang says Riverbank is priced quite competitively, given the area and current market situation. While things slow down, he said, \"good projects in good locations tend to move well\".\n\nCBRE research head Desmond Sim says competitive pricing is key in the area as buyers have various developments to choose from. He says buyers can take their time and make calculated decisions. \"If they cannot get the best unit, they can move on to other developments,\" he said.\n\nPricing for Riverbank could give some insight into how much interested buyers of nearby Rivertrees Residences will fork out for a unit.\n\nRivertrees is located just beside Riverbank, and is also a 99-year leasehold development. BT understands that buyers can register their interest from this Saturday. Developers Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Orchard and Sekisui House have not provided firm details on how the project will be priced.\n\nMarket watchers had previously said that the site on which Rivertrees will sit is superior to that of its neighbour, given its longer frontage along Sungei Punggol river. It is also set back from major roads.\n\nBut Mr Liam does not think demand for Riverbank will be affected, saying that both residences differ in their strengths and product angle. \"It's good to have a bigger crowd coming in - they can make their choice,\" he said.\n\nRivertrees has 487 apartments and eight strata landed homes. Units are sized between 495 sq ft for a one- bedder and 1,658 sq ft for a four-bedder.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its current owner, CBRE Global Investors, is understood to have put the 13-storey office block up for sale, with an indicative pricing of $175-180 million.\n\nThat would translate to $2,292-2,357 per square foot on net lettable area (NLA) of 76,362 sq ft for the building, which is on a site with about 82 years of remaining lease.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of the building is currently vacant, which allows for a potential occupier seeking to partly occupy the building as well as provision for signage and naming rights.\n\nBased on existing leases, the average passing rent is about $8 per square foot per month. Recently inked leases in the building have been at $8.50-$9.50 psf per month.\n\nOn a fully leased basis, the net yield is expected to be around 3.5-3.75 per cent.\n\nCBRE Global Investors, formerly known as ING Real Estate, paid $148 million for the property in 2011. It bought the asset from a private high net worth individual investor, who in turn had purchased it for $85 million in 2009 from a fund managed by Australia's Macquarie Bank. The latter made a loss on the transaction, against its 2007 purchase price of $129.5 million.\n\nThis time around, CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle are marketing the property for sale through private treaty.\n\nBesides a potential part occupier that may be keen on naming rights as well, Anson House may also appeal to core property funds looking for steady rental income stream from an asset that does not require refurbishment.\n\nAdding to this appeal is the relatively \"bite size\" pricing, in the $100-200 million range. Potential strata subdivision of the building, subject to approval from the authorities, could provide another angle for a buyer, who could then sell the individual units. The building has about 7,000 sq ft of space per floor, with three to four tenants on some floors.\n\nMajor tenants include ArcelorMittal and United Technologies.\n\nAnson House boasts a high floor-to-ceiling height of 3.4 metres, compared with the typical 2.9 metres for some newer office developments. In addition, it has 103 car parking lots reflecting a ratio of one car park lot for every 936 sq ft of gross floor area, one of the highest in the CBD.\n\nThe 15-year-old building recently underwent a refurbishment including the main lobby and toilets. Chillers were also replaced, improving energy efficiency.\n\nLast week, BT reported the sale of a half stake in the freehold Finexis Building at 108 Robinson Road in a deal that valued the property at nearly $2,300 psf on strata area.\n\nKeppel Reit is looking for a buyer for its 92.8 per cent share of Prudential Tower with an asking price of $2,400 psf of NLA. Based on the 222,563 sq ft NLA that the Reit owns in the 30-storey tower, the deal size would be around $534.1 million. The top floor is owned by Prudential and half of the 16th floor is held by a private investor. The building is on a site with a balance lease term of about 81 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Equity Plaza, jointly owned by Keppel Land and a fund managed by Alpha Investment Partners, could also be in the market. It is thought that the owners may be open to offers of around $580 million - translating to around $2,300 psf on net lettable area of about 252,600 sq ft. Formerly known as The Exchange and The Quadrant, the 28-storey office tower in Raffles Place is on site with about 74 years remaining lease.\n\nInvestors with a larger appetite and game for an asset that offers significant enhancement potential may be keen on AXA Tower at 8 Shenton Way. The owner, Blackrock, is said to be seeking at least $2,000 psf on the existing NLA of 674,000 sq ft, which would amount to $1.35 billion.\n\nAXA Tower's existing gross floor area of about 1.02 million sq ft can be raised by around 200,000 sq ft if unutilised plot ratio is tapped. This can potentially be used to build a retail podium on an undeveloped part of the site and the cost of which is in the process of being estimated.\n\nAXA Tower is on a site with about 67 years' balance lease.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Early last month, the trio granted options to Sun Venture-LKH to buy the office tower at $579.4 million, which works out to about $1,900 per square foot (psf) of net saleable area. The options were exercised on Jan 23.\n\nThe previous owners of Westgate Tower had been indicating office rents of $8 psf a month but potential occupiers baulked at the rate, BT understands.\n\nYesterday, Sun Venture managing director Alvin Teo told BT that the new owners' asking rent is around $6.50 psf.\n\nAt The Metropolis, next to Buona Vista MRT Station, Ho Bee is said to have inked a number of office leases at $7-plus psf. It is now believed to be calling mid-$7 psf rents for the last pockets of space in the development, which has slightly over one million sq ft of net lettable area. The Metropolis' two towers were completed last year.\n\n\"Brand new business park space in the suburbs can be leased in the low-$4 psf range,\" said an industry observer.\n\nWestgate Tower, a Green Mark Platinum building with Grade A office specifications, features efficient column-free space of about 17,000 sq ft per floor. This will allow occupiers to enjoy flexibility and efficiency in their office design, JLL said yesterday.\n\n\"There are many other key Grade A features such as a good floor-to-ceiling height of 2.8 metres, raised floor system and excellent quality finishes.\"\n\nThe seven-storey shopping centre in the Westgate project opened its doors in December last year.\n\nAt the next-door Jem project, also a retail-and-office project that has been completed, all 314,000 sq ft of office space has been leased to the Ministry of National Development, though the ministry has put up around 70,000 sq ft for subletting, according to an earlier BT report.\n\nNearby at Venture Avenue, Sim Lian is expected to begin strata sales of office units at its project in the first half of this year. Unit sizes will range from around 500-2,000 sq ft. The average price is expected to be around $2,000 psf.\n\nAll three developments are on 99-year sites.\n\nWe earlier reported that the previous owners of Jem indicated office rents of $8 psf a month, but this should have been for Westgate Tower.

The report indicated that a significant number of Western corporations have \"abnormally low net debt\"; in the US, the proportion of such companies make up 70 per cent of market cap.\n\nThis, however, comes with a caveat - that corporate leverage in America may not be as low as touted when credit-market debt is factored in.\n\nThe amount of debt through bonds, after deducting the amount of liquid assets held by corporations, has been on the rise as a proportion of gross domestic product.\n\nThat ratio now is not far from its early-2008 all-time high of about 100 per cent, data from Credit Suisse showed.\n\nStill, several companies in the West are in net-cash positions, and the uncertainty behind US economic policy has eased, the report noted.\n\n\"We believe that macro uncertainty will continue to edge lower, as the economic recovery in the US strengthens and recent signs from Washington indicate a greater bipartisan spirit in US policy making.\"\n\nCredit Suisse also noted that the gap between the earnings yield and the corporate bond yield remains above average.\n\nWhen the earnings yield - taken as the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio - is high relative to the corporate bond yield, it suggests that stocks are undervalued compared to bonds.\n\n\"Hence, M&A is abnormally earnings-enhancing,\" Credit Suisse said.\n\nIn Asia, M&As could be an option for emerging markets such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines, given the attractive demographics and room for growth in credit. Some consolidation should also be expected in the banking sector.\n\nCredit Suisse said: \"Hong Kong, on the radar of acquirers, would enable an acquirer to get a foothold in Greater China and to tap the offshore RMB market in Hong Kong. In most markets, there are significant barriers to foreign entrants, but some of them could selectively allow exceptions.\"\n\nOne example is of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group buying 75 per cent of Thailand's Bank of Ayudhya last year; the acquiring of a majority holding required an exception granted by Thai regulators on a foreign-ownership cap.\n\nCredit Suisse identified Japanese and Chinese firms as potential acquirers. Cash-flush Japanese corporations have been on the prowl. The cash and deposit holdings of Japan's non-financial firms hit a record high in the first quarter of last year, at 225 trillion yen (S$2.83 trillion).\n\nThis is bigger than both the size of Italy's economy, and the liquid assets held by US corporations, Bloomberg reported.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A 1979 law banned nonstop flights on large jets out of Love beyond Texas and its four neighbours. The restrictions were later eased to permit trips to eight states.\n\n\"There will be a negative impact on American as a result of this,\" Jeff Straebler, managing director for aerospace in the bonds and corporate finance group at John Hancock Financial Services. \"Given American's size, is it the end of the world? Certainly not. This is definitely a positive for Southwest.\"\n\nSouthwest recently agreed to buy additional flying rights at both LaGuardia and Reagan that were sold by American to win approval from US antitrust regulators for its December merger with US Airways Group Inc. Flights from those airports are limited by the government to control congestion.\n\n\"There is no way the fares won't come down,\" Mr Kelly said on Monday of competitors. \"It's competitive in North Texas. We're going to have to earn our customers and earn their business.\"\n\nThe airline won't announce fares or flight frequencies until May, he said, and customers can't book the routes until then.\n\n\"Thanks to our recent merger, American Airlines now has an expanded, robust global network, including 800 daily flights from Dallas-Fort Worth airport,\" Matt Miller, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see once they quit bloodying each other's noses and decide on what the real price point is going to be,\" said Rick Seaney, chief executive officer of FareCompare, a ticket research firm.\n\nIn 2004, Southwest began a two-year lobbying effort for the repeal of restrictions under the Wright Amendment, which it argued was anti-competitive, before securing a phase-out of the limits.\n\nThe legislation, authored by former Texas Congressman Jim Wright, was intended to protect the then newly opened Dallas-Fort Worth airport from competition. The amendment expires on Oct 13.\n\nSouthwest carries more than 96 per cent of passengers at Love Field, which is about 20 minutes from downtown Dallas and adjacent to the airline's headquarters. It has flown from Love Field since 1971.\n\nAmerican, combined with US Airways and its American Eagle regional airline, carries about 85 per cent of passengers at Dallas-Fort Worth, according to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/lng-may-soon-overtake-oil-main-ship-fuel", "site_title": "LNG may soon overtake oil as main ship fuel", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nLNG may soon overtake oil as main ship fuel\n\nCheaper gas, stricter environmental rules create demand for cleaner alternative\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Feb 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[LONDON] Natural gas has started to challenge oil as the dominant transport fuel with companies building gas-powered ships and installing networks of service stations on water and land. The expectation of cheaper gas and tighter environmental regulation have created demand for a cleaner alternative to the oil-based fuels that have so far dominated the transport world.\n\nAlthough European and Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices are currently high, trading at almost US$20 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) in Asia and around US$10 per mmBtu in Europe because of booming demand, analysts expect prices to drop substantially later this decade when new production rises.\n\nGermany, Singapore and the Netherlands are among the countries investing in natural gas transport hubs while companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Gazprom and Total are also developing LNG fuel infrastructure. Germany is making its first move into LNG for transport after Bomin Linde LNG signed a deal in January to supply ferry firm AG EMS and it is now building two LNG bunker terminals in Hamburg and Bremerhaven, due to start operations in 2015.\n\n\"Supplying their ferries with LNG makes AG EMS a pioneer in Germany and sends a clear signal that this low-emission propulsion system has arrived here,\" said Ruben Benders, managing director at Bomin Linde LNG.\n\nIn the Dutch port of Antwerp, Europe's second largest, the harbour authority says that there are \"all kinds of initiatives\" through which the use of LNG as fuel for shipping is encouraged.\n\nAt Rotterdam, Europe's biggest port, LNG also plays an increasing role in transport as the Gate LNG import terminal has begun supplying local river vessels and port tugs, as well as sending it on for use in the Baltic Sea where LNG is also seeing a pick-up in the marine sector.\n\nIn Asia, Singapore has invested in LNG bunkering capacity in anticipation of rising demand from large ships. Singapore's motivation to enter the gas for transport sector is driven by the expectation of huge growth in China, still a small user of natural gas, but where new regulation is aimed at shifting the power generation sector from coal to gas and the transport sector from oil towards more gas use.\n\nEnergy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says global gas demand in the transport sector could grow from under five billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2012 to over 160 bcm by 2030, which would be equivalent to two years worth of current British gas demand or around three million barrels of oil.\n\n\"Gas has traditionally played a niche role in global transport but it is now garnering greater attention,\" said Noel Tomnay, head of research at Wood Mackenzie. \"Oil and gas price differentials are now making investment in gas re-fuelling infrastructure worthwhile and . . . increased environmental restrictions on emissions are encouraging wider global uptake.\"\n\nVarious new regulations on sulphur emissions in the shipping sector will come into place for much of the North and Baltic Sea as well as the United States and Canada in 2015, which has driven interest in alternative fuels to diesel.\n\nIn North America, LNG is also gaining traction on land as a shale gas boom has led to a 50 per cent drop in US gas prices since 2008, making it competitive with oil in the transport sector.\n\nShell and TravelCenters of America are developing a network of LNG truck fuel stations that will allow US coast-to-coast LNG-fuelled road transport within a few years.\n\n\"Gas is cleaner and gas is cheaper - at least for now,\" said Bruce Carlton, president and chief executive of the US National Industrial Transportation League, a trade association. \"We are seeing a lot of attention being given to conversions to gas/LNG in the USA. . . Rail is probably a bit behind, but very interested in it as well,\" he said.\n\nTucker Gilliam of US transport and logistics group Crowley Liner Services, whose firm has ordered two LNG-powered vessels to operate between the US and Puerto Rico, said LNG for transport would gain further traction.\n\n\"As more is invested in infrastructure to produce and deliver the fuel, there will be greater opportunities for wider scale adoption,\" he said. He added that for Crowley, the driving force were \"significant environmental benefits\". - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Thus it brings together the largest number of high-level military and government delegations and leading industry players from across the world.\n\nAnd it consistently attracts more than 1,000 companies, including 60 of the top 100 aerospace companies from across the global aviation spectrum, seeking to forge partnerships and do business in this thriving market. The show also features a series of strategic conferences dedicated to commercial aviation, defence and aerospace technology.\n\nThis year's airshow comes barely three months after the Dubai Airshow in November last year. Anyone who witnessed the record orderflows at that gathering can safely bet that orderflows in Singapore will likely be comparatively muted. By the end of that eventful week in Dubai in mid-November, orders had hit almost US$200 billion, thanks largely to the cash-rich Gulf carriers.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways announced a deal for 56 new Boeing 777s valued at US$25.2 billion at list prices, including related GE engines. Dubai-headquartered Emirates rewrote the show's record with a US$99 billion purchase of Boeing and Airbus planes. With its order for 50 more A380s, Emirates now accounts for almost half the orders for that giant aircraft. Low-cost airline FlyDubai weighed in with a US$11.4 billion order for 111 Boeing 737s and 738s.\n\nDuring the last Singapore Airshow in 2012, total orders amounted to US$30 billion. By most accounts, this is decent. Singapore is not Dubai, and Asia-Pacific is not the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the Asia-Pacific region has been the focal point for global aviation growth during the past decade and continues to lead in aviation traffic growth. It is thus a critical battleground for planemakers who are vying for a stake in this growing pie - a market which covers about two-thirds of the world's population which is becoming increasingly affluent. South-east Asia on its own is also a key battleground for Airbus' 350 and Boeing's 787, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for one-third of all sales of the two twinjets. The slugfest will continue in Singapore next week.\n\nOn the defence side, Asia-Pacific countries have huge and growing budgets for procurements. They will likely have plenty to see in Singapore - outside of their home grounds, Singapore is known as the only place in Asia-Pacific where Western defence contractors are comfortable exhibiting their wares.\n\nThe headlines next week may not scream out huge orderbook numbers - at least not in the league of the Dubai Airshow. But no matter.\n\nThe Singapore Airshow is still a highly valued platform where both civil and defence aerospace players meet, discuss, plan and hammer out deals which might only be announced months from now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And with that, Mr Palazuelo, a developer of broken-down buildings from Europe to South America, was on his way to buying the biggest, most iconic eyesore in this city - the abandoned Packard Motor Car plant.\n\nThere are risky bets in commercial real estate, and then there is the Packard - vacant, vandalised and deteriorating for decades. Yet Mr Palazuelo's acquisition of the sprawling, 16 hectare Packard site on Dec 31 is part of the unlikely land rush occurring in Detroit, where investors from around the world are scrambling to buy vacant properties at the bottom of a historically distressed market.\n\nDetroit's empty buildings have lured buyers from all over, such as the Chinese firm that last year bought two office towers from a Florida company, and the individual investors from Europe and Asia who have scooped up derelict homes for less than US$1,000 each.\n\nBut no deal has captured the city's attention like Mr Palazuelo's purchase of the Packard.\n\nHe won a county-run auction to buy the dilapidated plant for US$405,000 - less than 15 cents a square foot for a trash-strewn, graffiti-covered hulk of industrial decay in the heart of a profoundly blighted neighbourhood. He was not the first to try to acquire it. Two other potential buyers, an Illinois developer and a Texas doctor, submitted higher bids but failed to come up with the money.\n\nBut Mr Palazuelo's US$405,000 is now in the county treasury and is non-refundable. It represents a small downpayment on the US$350 million he says he needs over the next 10 years to transform the Packard into a successful, mixed-use development.\n\nThe odds against him do not faze Mr Palazuelo, who is trying to raise capital for the project from business contacts in the United States, Europe and South America. \"I am a real estate developer but a very special one,\" he said. \"I have always been entering cities that have problems in the past.\"\n\nHis ambition to own the plant surprised even Mr Wojtowicz, who in 37 years as county treasurer had heard his share of wild ideas for redeveloping the ruins of Detroit. \"It was spontaneous and unexpected,\" Mr Wojtowicz said. \"But the proverbial seed was planted because of his sincerity.\"\n\nDetroit's development community is intrigued by Mr Palazuelo's strategy to methodically rebuild parts of the Packard over time. \"It is a lot of money, but any building that size is going to cost a lot,\" said Dan Pitera, an architecture professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. \"But it has possibilities if you do it one piece at a time.\"\n\nMr Palazuelo's personal odyssey makes him a fitting candidate to take on such a gamble. He made a fortune converting abandoned buildings into art galleries and apartments in his native Spain, only to lose everything in the recession of 2008. After filing for bankruptcy and on the heels of a bitter divorce, he moved to Lima to start over, drawn by the abundance of cheap, available property in the Peruvian capital.\n\nThen in July, Mr Palazuelo read in the local newspaper that Detroit had filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history and immediately sensed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He could not have picked a more problematic place than Detroit, home to an estimated 78,000 abandoned buildings including the decrepit Packard plant.\n\nMr Palazuelo, 58, stopped by the plant during a recent weeklong visit to Detroit to meet city officials and potential investors in his long-term plan. \"So many people have said to me that this is the very last place I want to be investing money,\" he said. \"But for me, Detroit is my new home.\"\n\nMr Palazuelo's company, Arte Express, has revived about a dozen older properties in Lima for banks, insurance companies and other businesses. Several of the buildings had been vacant for decades but were of historical significance.\n\nThe Packard plant, however, is miles from Detroit's downtown and surrounded by deserted streets and lots piled with garbage.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/picking-future-marine-fuels", "site_title": "Picking future marine fuels", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nPicking future marine fuels\n\nCompared to several alternatives, residual fuel may be unpleasant - but it has its advantages\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 4, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLAST week, we had a reminder that commercial ships generally use something called residual fuel oil in their engines. It is not the most pleasant of substances and you do not want to see it leak out into the environment. That is what happened, in relatively small quantities, following two collisions between vessels in Singapore waters within 24 hours.\n\nResidual fuel oil is difficult to deal with once it leaks into the sea but, fortunately, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) does have the resources to deal with spills effectively.\n\nEnvironmentalists would, on the whole, prefer shipping not to use such a potentially damaging pollutant as residual fuel oil. In the longer term term, they are likely to get their wish, though perhaps they should remember the old adage: \"Be careful what you wish for.\"\n\nThe future for marine fuels appears to be complicated. Classification society DNV GL has released a position paper on the future alternative fuel mix for global shipping. It says that while LNG (liquefied natural gas) is expected to be an early success, the picture becomes more diversified with time, as more than 20 per cent of shipping could adopt hybrid propulsion solutions, featuring batteries or other energy-storage technologies.\n\nDNV GL says that the main drivers for the use of alternative fuels are the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the need to meet upcoming air pollution requirements. That is right, but it is important to remember they are quite different issues, and in terms of which is more important in the short term, DNV GL mentions them in reverse order.\n\nHigh sulphur content\n\nThe paper's project manager Christos Chryssakis says: \"The global merchant fleet currently consumes around 330 million tonnes of fuel annually, 80-85 per cent of which is residual fuel with high sulphur content. Shipping must change, and we must contribute technical measures, operational measures and alternative fuels to meet the challenges we are tackling.\"\n\nDNV GL is a newly created organisation resulting from the merger of Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and Germanischer Lloyd (GL). Both of the original societies have a history of concern over fuel issues. DNV has been very involved in developing LNG as a marine fuel while GL made quite clear some time ago that it thought that shipping should switch away from residual fuel oil.\n\nThe paper says that, in the long term, short-sea shipping is expected to take advantage of locally produced fuels such as biogas, biodiesel, methanol, shoreside electricity and hydrogen. Deep-sea shipping needs globally available fuels and so will tend towards LNG and biodiesel, if it becomes available. Nuclear energy suffers from public perception problems but may come to the fore some time in the future if it can be perceived as a safe alternative.\n\nMr Chryssakis says: \"While renewable energy, particularly solar and wind, may have some potential to mitigate carbon emissions, this is not seen as a viable large-scale alternative for commercial shipping.\"\n\nI am not quite so sure about writing off wind-assist projects so easily. There is some good work going on in Japan right now in this area.\n\nThe DNV GL paper does make the important point that an evaluation of \"well to propeller greenhouse emissions\", rather than just shipboard potential to reduce emissions, demonstrates some major drawbacks for some of the options, as does an evaluation of potential availability. \"For example,\" DNV GL notes, \"the availability of land to grow biofuels is a significant barrier to its widespread use, with an area the size of Greece required to produce 50 million tonnes of biodiesel.\"\n\nChallenge for shipowners\n\nThe position paper includes a discussion on ways to overcome the challenges ahead during the transition towards a more sustainable future for shipping. \"There is no doubt that adopting new technologies is likely to be a challenge for shipowners. DNV GL is leading the way through our technology qualification processes which are designed to ensure that new technologies work as expected,\" says Mr Chryssakis.\n\nThat is very reassuring but let us keep our feet on the ground. There are, as already mentioned, two potential drivers of changes in fuel. The first is the need to take pollutants out of funnel emissions. With the imminent imposition of a 0.1 per cent sulphur limit in the International Maritime Organization-designated Emission Control Areas that is the big issue for shipping right now.\n\nThe new regime comes into effect on Jan 1 next year, with similar restrictions soon to apply in Hong Kong. For almost all ships, there are only two options: use \"clean\" but expensive distillate fuel, or fit abatement technology (commonly known as scrubbers) and continue to burn residual fuel oil.\n\nThe concerns about carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have not yet been translated into regulations, and there is still some way to go before they are. However, even if and when CO2 and other sustainability considerations become paramount, it is not clear that residual fuel, plus scrubbers, is such an environmentally horrific option when we look in terms of, as DNV GL puts it, \"well to propeller greenhouse emissions\".\n\nI have little doubt that many of the alternatives described in the DNV GL paper will have a role to play. It is quite possible that LNG will become the main marine fuel within a couple of decades, but let us not rule out residual fuel too quickly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But many of those flights won't be counted as late or cancelled in the government's on-time statistics.\n\nA recent federal report found that passengers are getting only part of the picture, and that the industry's on-time performance is actually much lower than billed. And a proposed rule that would require carriers to provide a more accurate picture has itself been delayed - and has yet to be adopted more than two years after it was proposed.\n\nOn-time statistics capture only 76 per cent of domestic flights at American commercial airports, according to a report released in December by the Department of Transportation's (DOT) inspector-general.\n\nThese statistics do not include many segments of the industry that have grown in recent years: international flights, flights flown by Spirit Airlines, or many flights operated by regional carriers and other partners. The biggest gap in reporting typically involves smaller planes that are more likely to be delayed or cancelled.\n\nThe proposed rule would increase the number of carriers required to report data about delays and cancellations, improving the accuracy of the on-time statistics that the government announces every month.\n\nIt is part of a set of passenger protections that began the lengthy federal rule-making process in April 2011, but the announcement of the final proposed rule has been postponed multiple times.\n\nThe latest target date for its release, Jan 24, has come and gone with no action by the DOT, leaving passenger advocates irate.\n\n\"I'm totally frustrated by this,\" said Charlie Leocha, director of the Consumer Travel Alliance, a passenger advocacy group. \"I've written letters, I've stood in front of the DOT with a big banner, I've gone on TV. Now we're up to around 1,000 days since the rule was proposed.\"\n\nThe inspector-general's report analysed a wide set of flight data, including records from the Federal Aviation Administration, and found that 64 per cent of the domestic flight delays at Philadelphia International Airport don't get counted in the official government statistics; neither do 51 per cent of the delays at Detroit Metropolitan Airport or 44 per cent of the delays at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington.\n\nAt those airports, many flights are operated by the regional partners of bigger carriers such as American, Delta or US Airways, so those delays are not reported to the DOT. That means the agency's monthly report - recently noting a 79 per cent on-time arrival record for the airline industry from January through November 2013 - is based on faulty statistics.\n\nThe numbers would be different if the government collected more complete data, researchers say.\n\nThe report also recommended re-examining the categories used to record the causes of flight delays, which include air carrier problems (such as aircraft maintenance), extreme weather, the national aviation system (air traffic control) or security issues.\n\nAuditors found that a fifth category, late-arriving aircraft, was listed as the reason for 37 per cent of flight delays in 2012.\n\nSaying a flight was late because the incoming aircraft arrived late missed capturing the real cause of the delay, the report said, suggesting the government re-examine that category.\n\nPerhaps a thornier problem for data collectors is how long passengers, not flights, are delayed, particularly with carriers operating near full capacity and few empty seats to accommodate travellers who get stuck - sometimes for days - because of a missed connection or cancelled flight.\n\n\"Wouldn't that be something - if you could see how many passengers were delayed one day, two days or three days?\" Mr Leocha said. \"I'm sure that would make people's jaws drop.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

MAHB has attributed the ballooned costs to the increase in scope and number of facilities needed to accommodate 45 million passengers a year - a figure revised from the original 30 million.\n\nConstruction works have also been problematic.

BP, too, has dropped plans to invest in a oil refinery there.\n\nThis was probably a factor that caused PetroChina to take a bit more time to decide on the SRC upgrading, even though Chevron, its partner in the joint venture SRC, had indicated late last year that it was prepared to go ahead with it.\n\nYesterday, the 50:50 venture announced that approval had been given by both its shareholders - Singapore Petroleum Company (which is PetroChina-owned) and Chevron for the upgrading project, which will add a gasoline desulphurisation unit, an amine treating unit, a heavy naphtha splitter and cogen units.\n\nSRC's latest ultra-low sulphur gasoline plant investment will treat the 26,000 bpd of gasoline it produces to Euro IV standard, that is, with sulphur content of under 0.005 per cent. The refinery has also secured an electricity licence from regulator Energy Market Authority to operate the two new cogen units of 36 megawatts each.\n\nSRC CEO James Er said: \"The Mogas/Cogen project is a significant investment in SRC by the shareholders and represents a major commitment to the future competitiveness of the refinery. Construction of new facilities will also create a large number of employment opportunities in Singapore, with about 2,000 engineers and construction personnel on site during the construction.\"\n\nMr Er told The Business Times that work would start almost immediately, with the upgrading investments targeted for commissioning in the first half of 2017, or in three years' time.\n\nFollowing a competitive bidding process, SRC awarded the engineering, procurement and construction contract to Japan's JGC Corporation, which has done work for the refinery previously, including building an ultra-low sulphur diesel plant for it.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, JGC said that it expected to complete construction of the SRC upgrading projects in 2016.\n\nSRC said: \"The gasoline clean fuels facility will enable SRC to produce transportation fuels to meet the increasingly stringent gasoline quality specifications in the region.\"\n\nWhile there may be a slowdown in the China market, this was not a major consideration for the expansion, Mr Er said, adding that the Jurong Island refinery caters more to the South-east Asian and Australian markets.\n\nHaving its own cogen plant will also increase its energy efficiency. \"This increase in efficiency, together with the conversion of the refinery boilers (for steam generation) from fuel oil to natural gas firing, will significantly reduce greenhouse gas and sulphur oxide emissions,\" SRC said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He is well respected, both for his abilities and intellect. But what would make or break his tenure at the top of one of the greatest technology companies in the world is how tough and ruthless he can be to drive change and not respect tradition.\n\nAs one commentator wrote, rather theatrically, the things to watch out for are: Can he fire folks in the lift? Can he yell at senior veterans in front of juniors? Can he say \"no\" to well-entrenched company views and products? More seriously, can he make nearly 130,000 employees do things differently in a company that, from a financial perspective, is doing quite well?\n\nWhile 22 years is a long time, especially in the technology sector, Mr Nadella has some seriously big shoes to fill. He's just the third CEO in Microsoft's 38-year history. And of the two before him, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, the first founded the company and brought to it its initial success, and the second consolidated its dominance in the personal computer and enterprise world. And both Mr Gates and Mr Ballmer have been long-time buddies going way back to when Microsoft was just another struggling startup. In contrast, Mr Nadella is an employee who climbed his way to the top on merit.\n\nMicrosoft is at a major crossroads today. Under Mr Ballmer, the company was already undergoing a sweeping reorganisation for better technology focus on mobile and cloud computing. Its goal is to transition to a device and services company to better grapple with the changing way consumers use technology. Mr Nadella has been an enthusiastic proponent of this change but it's still a work in progress, and one of the internal criticisms against Mr Ballmer has been that he wasn't driving the change fast enough.\n\nMicrosoft has been through two major transformations, once from the desktop to the client/server model and then from the client/server to the Internet.\n\nIn both cases, Microsoft was the incumbent and all it had to do was to stay agile enough to make the transition before any challenger came up. However, in the ongoing transition to cloud and mobile, Mr Nadella's company starts out as an underdog, trying to catch up and not as an incumbent. For instance, in mobile, Google's Android eco-system commands a 79 per cent share in the global smartphone market and Apple comes in with 13 per cent. But Microsoft is way behind with 4 per cent.\n\nMichael Barnes, vice-president & research director at Forrester Research, notes that enterprises around the world have strategic commitments to Microsoft Office, Windows and other major product lines. \"Still, some have reduced their Microsoft investments, a sign of their declining faith in Microsoft's ability to help them move into the new computing era we call the 'age of the customer'.\"\n\nHe adds that Mr Nadella now takes on the challenge of completing Microsoft's latest transition. \"Many aspects of the transition are going well, particularly Microsoft's cloud services, but others will require not only hard work but also potentially wrenching changes to business models, organisations, and cultures.\"\n\nIn this context, Microsoft watchers will be encouraged by the tone set by Mr Nadella in his first email to employees after assuming his new job. \"Our industry does not respect tradition - it only respects innovation. . . The opportunity ahead will require us to re-imagine a lot of what we have done in the past for a mobile and cloud-first world, and do new things.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, he notes that the opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast, but \"to seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster and continue to transform. A big part of my job is to accelerate our ability to bring innovative products to our customers more quickly\".\n\nOne of the interesting sub-plots in the story of Mr Nadella's elevation is that one of his conditions was that Mr Gates relinquish his chairman's job and take on a more active day-to-day role in the company. The Microsoft founder will work as a technology adviser to Mr Nadella, particularly for new products. Over the past few years, Mr Gates has been mostly involved with his charity work. In his role as chairman, he has been active with the board but didn't have too much involvement in day-to-day decision making. In his new role, he would be sort of a \"gatekeeper\" who would say \"no\" to products that are not yet ready.\n\nAs Mr Gates has been out of the day-to-day grind for six years, questions do remain about how current his knowledge is about product development and trends. Until 2008, he was known for his intense attention to detail, similar to his friend and competitor the late Steve Jobs of Apple. If he hasn't lost his touch he can be an asset to Mr Nadella. However, it would be interesting to see what happens if there's a divergence of opinion between the CEO and the founder.\n\nMr Nadella has his work cut out for him. Forrester's Mr Barnes notes that his policy focus will have to be to accelerate the overall pace of change within the company and increase incentives for cloud-based services critical to the company's continued success, such as Office 365 and Azure.\n\nAlong the way, he will have to make some radical choices that could upset the status quo at Microsoft. For example, in mobile computing he may have to take a call on whether Microsoft should allow a fully functional Microsoft Office (one of its crown jewels and chief incentive to get people to use Windows phones) to be available on Apple's iOS and the Android OS. Also, given the lack of applications for Windows Mobile, he might have to take a call on whether he wants to ditch Microsoft's mobile OS altogether and adopt Android, creating a customised \"fork\" in the OS similar to how Amazon muscled its way into the tablet space.\n\nMr Nadella is likely to continue to face some serious cultural and political barriers with many incumbent managers who are comfortable with the status quo. As Forrester notes, Microsoft's insistence on a single integrated enterprise stack and world domination is no longer practical - and will reduce its value and relevance to enterprise customers. How Mr Nadella tackles this problem will define his role and impact as CEO of this iconic company.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It offers 400 per cent tax deductions and cash payouts to businesses that spend on productivity-related investments, including staff training, automation, and research and development.\n\nBut results of the government's push for productivity have thus far been described by some as \"lacklustre\" and \"scant\".\n\nThe numbers seem to bear this out. According to the Department of Statistics, labour productivity edged up by only 1.3 per cent in 2011, and even shrank by 2.6 per cent the year after - a far cry from the government's target to achieve productivity growth of 2-3 per cent per year by 2020.\n\nWhen queried by Parliament's Estimates Committee on the reasons for the decline, the Ministry of Finance said that Singapore's short-term productivity performance was largely reflective of economic cycles. It added that productivity declined 2.6 per cent in 2012 due to weaker economic growth, especially in the trade-oriented manufacturing sector, which was weighed down by the patchy recovery in advanced economies.\n\nIndeed, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam recently called economic restructuring \"a multi-year task\" and \"not something that can be achieved in two or three years\".\n\nBut apart from pallid productivity growth numbers, others have questioned the success of PIC in terms of its take-up rate, particularly among smaller firms which arguably need to improve most.\n\nWhile the take-up rate in 2012 was highest among large firms with a turnover of $100 million and above (81 per cent), it was lowest for micro-enterprises with a turnover of less than $1 million (24 per cent).\n\nSmall firms with revenue between $1 million and $10 million had a take-up rate of 59 per cent, while that of medium-sized businesses with turnover above $10 million but below $100 million stood at 74 per cent.\n\n\"While the PIC is structured to appeal most to SMEs, it benefits all companies - big and small,\" noted EY's Tan Bin Eng and Tracy Tham, partner and senior manager respectively of the firm's Business Incentives Advisory.\n\nBut with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) forming the backbone of Singapore's economy - they make up 99 per cent of all businesses here, hire 70 per cent of the labour force, and contribute almost half of GDP - there is concern that PIC resources aren't being channelled to businesses that are truly in need of assistance.\n\nSaid DBS economist Irvin Seah: \"The take-up rate of the PIC for smaller companies is exceptionally low compared to the bigger ones ... It could be reflecting that things are too onerous for the smaller guys. They need just as much, if not more help from the government.\"\n\nAccording to various audit firms and business associations, smaller companies often have limited know-how and resource constraints, which can hamper intentions to apply for government incentives.\n\nThat is why the vast majority of stakeholders favour an extension of the PIC beyond its 2015 expiry, over the implementation of a brand new scheme (or worse, its termination).\n\nBut they also want the government to simplify its rules, since SMEs' efforts to comply with administrative procedures can sometimes mean disproportionately high costs, compared to the benefits enjoyed.\n\nWhile Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) chief executive Phillip Overmyer noted the government's good intentions in developing a suite of schemes to support SMEs, he highlighted that many have found it \"onerous and time-consuming\" to comb through those of most use.\n\n\"In some cases, SMEs are not even certain if they qualify for the schemes and tend to be put off by the complex application process,\" said Mr Overmyer.\n\nKPMG's head of tax, Tay Hong Beng, meanwhile, would like to see a more forgiving taxman: \"The tax administration of the PIC scheme can also be improved, providing more leeway for companies to voluntarily disclose and correct honest mistakes in claims made.\"\n\nThis is especially so for smaller firms, who traditionally have minimal exposure to tax incentives.\n\nThere are also those - a small minority - who want to see an end to business productivity incentives, since results have been sub-par. According to findings from a recent KPMG pre-budget survey, 3.2 per cent of respondents said the PIC scheme \"has not been useful\" and don't want it extended.\n\nPart of this stems from disgruntlement with fraudsters. According to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras), common abuses include inflating claims by issuing invoices with higher prices; creating false records; setting up shell companies to make multiple claims; and hiring phantom employees to meet the criteria where firms must have at least three workers to make their claims.\n\nIn addition to these outright abuses of the system, there are also concerns about legally-valid claims that go against the spirit of the PIC scheme.\n\nSaid CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"Some companies are just using the schemes to change old office computers for new ones, since taxpayers are forking out the money, rather than seriously looking at how new technology or work processes can help them do more with less. So one view is that maybe it's better (to withhold help entirely until they either) get the message (to restructure) or pack up. It's not a bad strategy since there are still plenty of businesses who are willing to expand or start up here.\"\n\nBut UOB economist Francis Tan thinks that Singapore cannot afford the \"chain reaction\" that could hit the economy if that were to happen: \"Some might say we should force out the companies who can't restructure altogether, but I don't think that's a viable option. If the government is taking away companies' cheap labour - which they've been used to for so many years - it also needs to support and ease them into the new way of doing things.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM\n\nAI is already showing signs of slashing job openings in the UK\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:30 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nNew Zealand spending slowdown adds to signs of cooling economy\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:54 AM", "images": []}

By the same token, it is the Fed's decision to taper that money expansion which has triggered a flight of capital out of EMs and sent EM stock markets sliding. Clearly, exiting QE is a lot harder than entering.\n\nIn the Fed's defence, it could well be that when things go awry, a natural response is to look for scapegoats - and there is none as convenient as the US central bank. After all, even though the EM selloff began in earnest only a couple of weeks ago, weakness first set in on May 22 last year when then Fed chief Ben Bernanke first spoke of tapering.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

And if you do what you are told, well, they could be punished anyway.\n\nTurkey's central bank set out this week to show that it was changing its ways. After months of watching the country's currency lose value, and of refusing to raise interest rates despite receiving lots of advice from overseas to do so, it called a news conference, hinting that it would raise rates.\n\nIt not only raised them, it sent them soaring. One rate - the central bank has a lot of them - rose to 10 per cent from 4.5 per cent. That was enough to quiet the talk that the bank was subservient to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had loudly opposed any rate increase. It impressed the currency market - for a few hours. But by the end of the next day, the bounce was gone. As a result, noted Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management, Turkey is receiving \"the worst of both worlds\". The higher rates will dampen local economic activity, \"while foreign investors are hardly likely to be enticed by increased yields given the volatility and downside potential of the currency\".\n\nThe local crisis would seem to have room to run, and the question for global investors is the degree of international contagion that can be anticipated from Turkey's woes. Not that long ago, Turkey seemed to be a rousing economic success story. Economic growth was impressive and foreign capital was coming in rapidly. Now inflation seems to have taken off, and the Turkish lira is down about 20 per cent since the end of 2012. The Turkish stock market has lost a third of its value in lira since last spring.\n\nTurkey's problems are not entirely economic. The government, which is in the middle of a corruption investigation that forced three ministers to resign and seemed to be pointing at the PM, decided to replace the police who were investigating it. Much of the country's growth has come from construction in Istanbul, and the investigation relates to possible bribes to change zoning rules.\n\nThe widespread worry about emerging markets - investors are also nervous about Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia, to name a few - can in some ways be traced to the fact that they did remarkably well during the credit crisis that began in 2008.\n\nMany of them had hefty foreign currency reserves, and their growth attracted foreign investment. That investment helped to push up local asset prices, which intensified the boom and brought in more capital. Eventually, money flowed in from investors chasing performance, a sort of \"What goes up must keep going up\" attitude. The currencies appreciated, and countries began to buy more things from abroad while their industries were losing competitiveness. Current-account deficits began to soar, but that did not immediately matter because the capital was still coming in.\n\nWhen the cycle turns, as it eventually must, investors who were clamouring to invest can suddenly demand to get out. How much a country is hurt may depend on what form that capital infusion took.\n\nForeign direct investment, like building plants or buying local companies, cannot be quickly or easily reversed. But bank loans can fade away, and those who bought stocks on the local market can sell quickly. The worst problem can come from short-term debt to foreigners, who can get cold feet at the worst possible time.\n\nThat is why capital controls can make sense when times are good. Countries that have easy access to loans may be better off not taking them.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which has been among the most bearish on emerging markets in recent months, looked at a variety of indicators this week and concluded that the most exposed countries were Brazil, South Africa, Ukraine and Turkey. It pointed out that a third of Turkey's external debt was short term and that the country's foreign exchange reserves were smaller than the amount of its short-term external debt.\n\nEmerging markets swooned last spring after the Federal Reserve began to talk about pulling back on its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The fear was that money would flow out of emerging markets as US interest rates rose. They got over that when it became clear that scaling back was not going to immediately have a huge effect on markets. But that plunge, even though many markets recovered, seems to have reminded investors that they needed to focus on market fundamentals and structural issues. And some countries appeared worse than others.\n\nDavid A Rosenberg, the chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, a Canadian research firm, looked at six indicators - large current-account deficits, large capital inflows from 2010 to 2012, relatively high levels of fixed investment, slowing economic growth, rising inflation and weak productivity growth.\n\nHe found eight countries that he considered vulnerable on at least four of those measures: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Taiwan, Russia and Malaysia.\n\nWhat, he asked, happened to all that capital that poured in? \"One can reasonably draw the conclusion that, as we have seen time and again, the foreign capital inflow was squandered either on conspicuous consumption or non-competitive investments,\" he wrote.\n\nThe last big crisis in the developing world was in Asia in the late 1990s. This one does not seem similar, simply because the lesson most countries learnt was that fixed exchange rates were extremely dangerous. (Someone should have told Europe, which was then ramping up for the creation of the euro.) Now currencies are generally allowed to float, and most of the countries viewed as vulnerable have experienced substantial currency depreciation, which will help their exporters grow more competitive.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM", "images": []}

The retreat dragged down the MSCI Emerging Markets Index's valuation to 11 times reported earnings, a 40 per cent discount against the MSCI World Index, the widest gap since October 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nEmerging-market stocks and bonds are tumbling as China's economy slows, weak currencies from Turkey to South Africa spur central banks to raise interest rates and the US Federal Reserve pushes ahead with plans to reduce monetary stimulus.\n\nThe MSCI developing-nation gauge has dropped 8.7 per cent this year, extending its worst start since 2009, while a JP Morgan Chase & Co gauge of local-currency debt has lost 0.9 per cent.\n\nThe emerging-market stocks measure dropped 1.2 per cent to 915.38 at 9.50am in London yesterday, heading for the lowest close since August, while the MSCI World gauge of developed-nation shares fell 0.6 per cent. Global equities have lost about US$2.9 trillion of market value this year as the sell-off spread from emerging markets to Japan, the US and Europe.\n\nEmerging-market currencies rebounded yesterday, with South Africa's rand gaining 1.2 per cent against the US dollar and Turkey's lira strengthening 1.1 per cent. Both currencies have weakened more than 5 per cent against the greenback this year.\n\n\"Like we saw in the last few years, when there are excesses in terms of expectations about one asset class or the other and things move in the wrong direction, you have very violent moves on the other side,\" said Mr Ermotti, whose bank reported yesterday fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates.\n\nSome strategists see further losses for emerging markets.

Mr Ang noted that firms were busy handling the surge in Thai companies' cross-border M&A activity and the launch of the country's first infrastructure funds and real estate investment trusts (Reits) - a new addition to the country's flourishing real estate market.\n\nThailand also recorded high levels of outbound investment last year. Singapore and Myanmar were the primary magnets, followed by Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nDespite the political uncertainty, Mr Ang reckoned that \"Thailand is still a place we want to keep our eye on\" and the outbound deals are likely to continue. He also revealed that WongPartnership is in preliminary discussions on some possible deals, but there's \"nothing concrete yet\".\n\nThe firm advised on the largest deal coming out of Thailand in 2012/2013: the debt-funded acquisition of Fraser & Neave by the common majority shareholder of TCC Assets and ThaiBev.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Mr Ang highlighted Malaysia as the most attractive investment target in the region after Singapore. \"Investment there slowed down a little last year due to the elections, but enthusiasm and interest is now returning,\" he said, citing the country's well-developed legal framework and pro-business policies as selling points.\n\nLast year, Malaysia introduced the Financial Services Act and the Islamic Financial Services Act. The latter, noted Mr Ang, was partly an attempt by the government to make its Syariah-compliant financial services market more attractive to investors. He added that some firms have elected to make the two Acts an area of focus to attract enquiries from foreign companies.\n\n\"The pro-business government has been supportive in particular of the Iskandar region, giving special exemption for real capital gains tax, for example. Regardless of which party is in power, the atmosphere (in Malaysia) is pro-investment. Thus there is great interest among private-equity funds from all over in Malaysia. Some Malaysian businesses don't require PE funding but the owners are happy to cash out of some of their investments through stake sales.\"\n\nAnd while Myanmar may seem like a fad to some, Mr Ang believes there is real potential there. He said investing in the country still presents a number of \"unknowns\" and, as a result, it's not attractive to private-equity firms.\n\n\"It's more for corporates from the consumer, real estate and infrastructure sectors. You will still need to team up with a local partner, though, if you want to invest successfully in Myanmar.\n\n\"The Japanese investors are still there in a big way; in fact, they never left - we know this from our interaction with Japanese law firms. Singapore is a beneficiary of that, being one of the few countries in the region with a double-tax agreement with Myanmar, so investors like the Japanese use Singapore as a base.\"\n\nHe added that the test for Myanmar will be the next elections.\n\nIn similar vein, investors will be watching this year's elections in Indonesia very closely.\n\nSaid Mr Ang: \"With the 2014 elections looming, the government has focused on policies aimed at controlling foreign investment in certain sectors such as mining and banking. Inconsistent regulatory changes and continued concerns over corruption are fuelling uncertainty among investors and having a knock-on effect by delaying badly needed infrastructure development.\n\n\"With the rupiah's slide, Indonesian owners are reluctant to sell at a discount. They can also afford to be patient as they are well capitalised and don't require funding.\"\n\nIn the case of China, Mr Ang foresees a rebound in M&A activity this year.\n\nHe said: \"Over a year ago, there was a general reduction in China- related M&A activity, with the weak global economy, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and China's leadership change all being contributing factors. The private-equity sector in Greater China has also struggled in recent times, and the continued uncertainty in the global economy and shifting investment strategies have led to an increase in divestments by multinational companies and other foreign investors.\n\n\"However, we are increasingly witnessing greater enthusiasm now among Chinese funds, especially PEs like Citic and CDH buying S-chips here in Singapore. These funds are taking a larger role than internal funding, previously the preferred funding route, for S-chips.\"\n\nMr Ang added that he is seeing interest among Chinese funds not just in S-chips or deals with a Chinese element, but also in deals involving regional or global players.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If the assets are held for the purposes of trade, the gains would likely be considered taxable income; if they are held for the long-term strategic interests of the business, then the assets would be considered capital - and the gains not taxable.\n\nThis judgment also confirms the broader principle that regulatory rules and requirements have little or no impact on taxation rules.\n\nThe case in question involves the Comptroller of Income Tax (CIT) and an unidentified company referred to only as \"BBO\" in the judgment. The case report did not disclose the identity of the taxpayer, as the Income Tax Act requires tax cases to be heard \"in camera\" (meaning, in private) to ensure secrecy.\n\nHowever, BBO is identified as having carried on the business of a general insurer in Singapore and was registered under the Insurance Act until December 2009.\n\nThe facts of the case are that BBO had established a Singapore Insurance Fund for its Singapore policies and an Offshore Insurance Fund for its overseas policies. This move was in line with Section 17 of the Insurance Act, which requires an insurer to set up separate insurance funds for each class of insurance business, and to ensure that all assets, receipts, liabilities and expenses are properly attributed to the relevant fund.\n\nBBO then used the two funds to invest in shares in three companies identified only as C, D and E.\n\nIn 2001, a company referred to as \"F\" launched a successful takeover of C. BBO sold its entire stakeholding in C to F as a result of the takeover, making a gain of about $89 million from it.\n\nIn 2002, BBO sold its holdings in D and E, making about $9.3 million from these two sales.\n\nThe CIT sought to tax all these gains, basing its core argument before the Court of Appeal on Section 17 of the Insurance Act. This requires that money from insurance premiums be retained in a fund to meet liabilities underwritten by the contracts obtaining those premiums, such that the assets of the particular business and its parts are identified. It argued that these assets would cease to be part of the insurance business only if they were determined to be \"surplus to such requirements\", such that they might be transferred out of the insurance fund into the shareholders' fund.\n\nThe CIT argued that, in the absence of such transfers, any realisation of assets which had been purchased with premiums - as was the case for the shares in C, D and E - would give rise to a profit or loss over cost, which is part of the taxable insurance business.\n\nBBO counter-argued that the Insurance Act was irrelevant in this case because, among various reasons:\n\nThe Court of Appeal accepted BBO's argument that the purpose of the Insurance Act is the regulation, not the taxation, of the insurance industry.\n\nIt also ruled that the distinction between the insurance fund and the shareholders' fund cannot determine the tax treatment of particular assets or investments, and that capital assets do not become revenue assets just because they could potentially be applied to meet the company's liabilities.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also held that the Insurance Act was not determinative of the central issue here, and that the basic principles of revenue law would instead apply. In this respect, it noted that whether any gains or profits are subject to income tax would depend on whether the gains or profits are of an income nature.\n\nIt looked at whether the gain in question was a mere enhancement of value through the realisation of a security, or whether it was made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making.\n\nIn this case, the Court of Appeal considered the following:\n\nThe court thus ruled that \"the shares were capital assets and the gains attributable to them were therefore not liable to tax\".\n\nFoo Hui Min and David Lim of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore appeared for the CIT; Tan Kay Kheng and Tan Shao Tong of WongPartnership represented BBO.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It turns out that officials running the base while it is in the process of being turned over to the city of San Francisco don't have permits for the Internet titan or anyone else to construct a vessel on the shore of Treasure Island.\n\n\"This is Google's vessel, but we are not dealing with them,\" San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission regulatory affairs director Brad McCrea said. \"It is the pier that doesn't have permitting; whether they use it to build a barge or a speed boat or have a rodeo, TIDA doesn't have the authority to do anything.\" He was referring to the Treasure Island Development Authority, which is running the former Navy property as it makes the transition into the hands of San Francisco.\n\nThe state commission sent a letter to TIDA stating that it had received complaints about work on a \"Google Barge\" and, after investigating, determined that no permits were issued to use the pier for that or any other project.

Commission officials have met with Google, but the permit issue is a matter to be resolved by TIDA.\n\nGoogle is using shipping containers to turn the barge into a vessel that will evidently be used as an event space; to showcase technology, and for marketing, according to the commission. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

This poses an issue for banks looking to gain a significant foothold in Asean through mergers and acquisitions, since several countries in Asean allow foreign buyers to snap up only a minority share of a local bank.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns over rising costs of compliance and regulations for banks across the world, said Mr Zink in an interview with BT. \"These are the most profound set of regulatory changes in at least a generation,\" he said. \"Very profound, and not yet visible.\"\n\nUnder Basel III, a bank that holds a minority share exceeding 10 per cent of another lender must have its holding fully deducted against its capital. This makes a controlling stake more viable, but acquisitions of a majority stake in an Asean bank are often subject to caps on foreign ownership. DBS abandoned its proposed acquisition for Indonesia's Bank Danamon last year, because it did not receive the regulator's blessing to acquire more than 40 per cent of the bank.\n\n\"It becomes very expensive to hold them,\" said Mr Zink, referring to minority stakes in general. \"It makes a big difference. Some people may still, for strategic reasons, say, 'that's my best entry into that really important market'. But for us, an investment is a generational decision: build your own business with your own brand.\"\n\nHigher capital requirements also mean that banks are unlikely to hold long-term assets such as infrastructure bonds that have tenures of 10-20 years, which will become more expensive under new liquidity- coverage requirements. \"The capital markets will have to fill the gap,\" said Mr Zink.\n\nBesides tougher capital standards, the systems upgrades to meet regulatory requirements are also eating into profits. For example, the recent implementation of the Do-Not-Call registry has meant that banks have to apply stricter credit-bureau checks.\n\n\"Banks have a responsibility to know how much Mr and Mrs Ong have borrowed collectively. That requires us to build more systems. It's socially beneficial, but (it's) not cheap,\" he added. \"It has a huge impact on spread compression and competition.\"\n\nThen, there is still concern over the Volcker Rule, which aims to tackle the risk behind proprietary trading at US banks that also take deposits. \"The Volcker Rule is 70 pages long, and the preamble to the Volcker Rule, which summarises all the comments made by the industry, is 870-something pages. And this is just one piece of Dodd-Frank. It's going to keep unfolding for years,\" said Mr Zink.\n\n\"Will the Volcker Rule, as it is written, show up here? Who knows. But there certainly is going to be the idea that deposit- taking institutions shouldn't engage in proprietary trading. That's pretty easy to embrace.\"\n\nOne positive development that has emerged from the global financial crisis is that regulators of key financial centres, including Singapore, are looking at some form of regulatory harmonisation, Mr Zink added. \"It's not going to be perfect, but they don't (want) any options and opportunities for arbitrage to open up. And that's going to be a good thing.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore, in particular, saw a 25 per cent rise in disclosed PE investments in 2013 - 59 deals totalling US$639.6 million - compared with 2012.\n\nMalaysia and the Philippines witnessed a 169 per cent and 440 per cent year-on-year jump in disclosed PE investments, respectively.\n\nIndonesia, however, saw disclosed PE investments fall 79 per cent in 2013, compared with the year before.\n\nOverall, China remained the biggest beneficiary of disclosed PE investments in the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan region, even if total investments fell. Chinese companies attracted US$4.5 billion worth of deals from 198 firms - a 47 per cent decline in deal flow from 2012. These investments, however, represented 39 per cent of the regional market share.\n\nIndia had the next largest market share at 27 per cent, with US$3 billion worth of investments - albeit 37 per cent down from last year.\n\nSouth Korea came in third with 41 deals totalling US$1.3 billion, while Singapore took fourth place. Hong Kong rounded out the top five with 13 deals totalling US$596 million.\n\nIn terms of PE deals by sector, Thomson Reuters data showed that industrial and energy-related companies captured the largest portion of the disclosed equity invested in the region, with a 27 per cent market share; there were 70 completed investment deals in this sector from 90 firms worth US$3.1 billion - a 49 per cent increase from 2012.\n\nThomson Reuters said that this was driven by the total PE investment received by Gansu Jiu Steel Group Hongxing Iron & Steel Co Ltd. Its investors included Haixiang Tianjin Venture Capital Management Co Ltd, Rich Asset Management Co Ltd, and other undisclosed firms. The sum invested totalled US$1.3 billion in January 2013, making it the largest PE investment deal in the Asia-Pacific last year.\n\nInternet-related companies also saw the most number of PE investment deals at 231, worth US$2.7 billion in aggregate total. The total sum accounted for 24 per cent of the PE investments in the region, and was a 54 per cent decline from 2012.\n\nMedical and health companies took a 10 per cent market share, while financial services captured 9 per cent, and both saw lower investments compared with the year before.\n\nThese four top industries together make up at least 70 per cent of the PE investments in the Asia-Pacific, Thomson Reuters said.\n\nMeanwhile, the amount of PE exits through initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2013 fell 37 per cent from the year before, with 46 deals raising US$7.9 billion in proceeds. In 2012, 103 deals raised US$12.5 billion.\n\nPE exits through IPOs of China-based companies accounted for more than half (54 per cent) of the region's IPO exit activity - with 18 IPOs worth US$4.3 billion in 2013. Still, that is down 53 per cent from 2012, with the China A-share IPO market remaining quiet last year after the the suspension of IPO approvals in China in late 2012.\n\nThomson Reuters noted that the IPO suspension in China's stock exchanges pushed Chinese companies to tap other equity markets outside China. It noted that the majority of the Chinese IPO exits listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's (HKSE) main board - with 10 issues worth US$3.4 billion - and one listed in HKSE's Growth Enterprise Market (Gem) for US$9.3 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The dogged efforts by Asean countries to meet next year's deadline to implement the Asean Economic Community Blueprint - which sets out goals to \"transform Asean into a single market and production base\" - are being pitted against social tensions such as income equality, and in Singapore's case, the fear over a reliance on foreign labour.\n\n\"It's the aspiration of the community,\" said Mr Zink, referring to the blueprint. \"Nobody's backing away from this.\"\n\nThe central plan in the blueprint is the Asean Single Window that would, among other things, speed up cargo clearance. This, according to a protocol published by the economic bloc last year, would involve the use of a single set of customs documentation, and a synchronised data-processing system. Such efforts to boost cross-border trade presents Citi with \"the biggest opportunity\" today to tap on intra-Asean trade - which hit some US$600 billion in 2012, said Mr Zink.\n\n\"It's a reflection of the vibrant supply chains that have emerged here,\" he told BT. \"Sometimes it's as simple as saying, 'when you get to the border, you don't have to change trucks'. And how much friction does that take off? A lot. Some people might say it's prosaic, but this is how commerce works.\"\n\nNon-US operations of Citigroup already make up more than half of the American bank's business, with Asia and Latin America as key regional markets. Citigroup does not publish a detailed geographical breakdown of revenue and profit contributions, though Mr Zink could say that the Asean business, which made up \"less than half\" of the total Asian operations, has already met the targets set for measures such as return on assets and operating efficiency. Citi is operating in all Asean countries except Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar.\n\nHaving Asean align with a single set of cross-border trade standards fits Citi's strategy to host data centres and transaction-processing hubs in key cities in Asean - with three of five, including one in Singapore, based in the region - that would allow Citi to take advantage of its scale, he said.\n\nEven as the Asean blueprint seeks to encourage a liberal flow of investment, and a freer flow of capital, there are clear signs that the capital markets in Asean are already maturing. In analysing the US$9.4 billion acquisition of China's Ping An Insurance by Thailand's CP Group, Mr Zink noted that the equity capital markets in the region have already grown to about US$2 trillion, or around the size of the region's collective GDP.\n\n\"The debt capital markets are about a trillion dollars, also up fivefold since 2000. So suddenly, we have markets deep enough to finance a nine-billion-dollar deal,\" he noted. \"There is a confidence, coupled with the availability of assets, and the ability to finance it.\"\n\nThis also comes as banks such as Citi try to reach customers in both the business and consumer segments through digital channels, especially as countries in the region have resisted from lifting restrictions on the number of branches that foreign banks can set up.\n\n\"Even corporate managers today are perfectly happy to initiate their transactions on their devices. They are no longer chained to their offices,\" said Mr Zink. \"We spend less time pushing for branching today, and more time trying to reach the customer, which changes the conversation with the regulators. Now, the conversation around cyber-security has become one of the top issues in the world.\"\n\nSome of that regulatory pressure can be eased through trade deals such as the Asean Single Window, which would allow the region to set expectations about data protection, he added.\n\nBut a more worrying wave of social tension has emerged. \"The uneven distribution of income is becoming a very common conversation. Cambodia's having that discussion - the garment workers are saying, 'we are not asking for a zillion dollars, we are asking for $165 a month'. You come to Singapore, and there's a conversation about talent and workers, and whether Singaporeans are getting an equal opportunity,\" the banker said.\n\n\"They all seem to have come at once,\" he added. \"Derail would be far too strong a word. But these are questions that have an impact on the shape of the economies that emerged, and we, as business people, have to play our position.\"\n\nMr Zink recalled the \"collective gasp in the room\" in 2011, when Singapore lenders were told about \"Basel+2\" - banks had to hold two percentage points more of top-quality capital as a ratio to risk-weighted assets, compared to requirements under Basel III. \"He (Minister Lim Hng Kiang) explained ... 'we want to position Singapore as the best capitalised, most secure, most stable financial service in the region, maybe in the world. Any questions?',\" said Mr Zink.\n\n\"Sir, no sir, we got it sir.\"\n\nCiti has also been sensitive to the call by the government for companies to give Singaporeans a fair chance to rise up the ranks as their global peers.\n\n\"Singaporeans should run Singapore. The Koreans should run Korea, and the Indians should run India,\" said Mr Zink, noting that this has also been part of Citi's culture. \"If you walk the halls, and you want to find Singaporeans, you'll trip over them,\" he added. \"If policies shift, we just adapt. We don't resist it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Critics say that many governments have done too little to remove barriers to domestic and foreign business investment, cut red tape, upgrade infrastructure and develop deep, well-functioning financial markets when the region was flush with cheap money.\n\nNow that economic rocks are emerging as the tide of the Fed's easy cash recedes, central banks are having to step in, detouring from their price and financial stability mandates, to shore up weak economies.\n\nIndia and Indonesia were first in the firing line of investors last year when the Fed's plans to scale back its US$85 billion in monthly cash injections started to take shape. Both took emergency steps, intervened in markets and raised interest rates to shore up battered currencies. Since then, the Fed has started winding down its stimulus in earnest, putting emerging markets on the back foot once again as investors look to target the most vulnerable economies.\n\nThe Indonesian and Indian authorities have improved their defences against rapid outflows but their governments have failed to tackle supply bottlenecks and market rigidities that fuel inflation and limit room for policy manoeuvre, economists say. Both face national elections this year that could lead to populist measures and further delay reforms.\n\nIn Thailand, months of political turmoil have paralysed the government, leaving the central bank as the mainstay of economic support. \"Government and monetary policies should be fairly balanced,\" says Rob Subbaraman, chief Asia economist at Nomura in Singapore. \"In India, and increasingly Thailand, the governments have not done their part. There's a risk Indonesia goes this way as the elections draw closer,\" said Mr Subbaraman, who has been warning, since mid-2013, of emerging Asia's growing exposure to market turmoil.\n\nEven in Japan and China, with their strong and stable political leaderships, central banks appear to be doing most of the heavy lifting. In Japan, a blast of central bank money has boosted the economy and markets, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms have disappointed. China's central bank is trying to rein in an explosion of off-balance sheet and risky lending as cautious government regulators resist speedier financial reform that would force markets to price risk more realistically.\n\nAsian central bankers rarely air their frustrations in public. India's former central bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao was an exception, regularly sparring with New Delhi over economic reforms and rates.\n\nAfter a series of rate hikes by Indonesia's central bank, an official there in October voiced his vexation that the government was not tackling the root cause of a widening trade and current account gap - its own spending. \"We need to address the cause of illness when running a fever,\" Dody Budi Waluyo, executive director of Bank Indonesia economic and monetary policy department told Reuters at the time. \"The medicine should not only be Panadol to lower the fever.\"\n\nIn picking up the reins from government, the risk is that central banks will deliver neither the stability they seek, nor the economic support that is needed.\n\nIn Japan, for example, the concern is that optimism spurred by the Bank of Japan's massive cash injections will fade without reforms to unshackle the economy's untapped growth potential and help overcome the problems of a fast-ageing society. The Chinese central bank's attempts to curb risky lending by calibrating supply of money market funds have triggered repeated cash crunches that threaten to ignite market panic.\n\nIndonesian and Indian central banks may be forced to tighten monetary policy more than their slowing economies would otherwise have warranted because of fragile market sentiment and sticky inflation that remains high even when growth cools. In an ominous sign for India, foreign investors have been net sellers of the country's stocks this year.\n\nThailand's central bank is under pressure to fill the void left by stalled infrastructure spending and provide the struggling economy with stimulus, but is well aware of the risks. \"Maintaining monetary policy in an accommodative mode for a long period of time runs the risk of delays in reforms as they may seem less pressing and the risk of financial imbalances build up,\" Bank of Thailand spokeswoman Roong Mallikamas told Reuters.\n\nIn Japan, one concern is that without fundamental reforms promised as part of Mr Abe's \"Abenomics\" revival plan, markets will reverse and Japan will lurch back into its deflationary equilibrium or \"stagflation\" - a spell of tepid growth and rising prices. Japan Risk Forum, which groups risk managers from Japan's major financial institutions, sees nearly a 50-50 chance of that happening.\n\n\"We cannot rely solely on monetary policy forever and the time will come when the government's resolve will be tested by markets, likely around summer,\" said Hiroshi Watanabe, head of state-run lender JBIC and Japan's former top financial diplomat.\n\nTo be fair, central bankers may have contributed to their own predicament by keeping monetary policies too loose for too long after the global financial crisis, either because of political pressure or fear of more turmoil.\n\nNomura estimates that taken as a whole, real interest rates measured as a difference between official rates and inflation in Asia's 10 biggest economies excluding Japan were negative for more than half the time since 2008 - a recipe for rapid debt build-up and property and stock market bubbles. By contrast, rates were negative for only 16 per cent of the 1996-2007 period.\n\nThere are also some signs of change. India is embarking on an ambitious monetary policy overhaul that would make it harder for the government to lean on the central bank, while the government has curbed gold imports and secured US$34 billion in overseas financing to try to close its current account deficit. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Last week, the region also witnessed its largest equity outflows since Aug 11. The mounting financial instability and political risks in a number of EM countries and growing concerns about China's growth led to the sell-off in EM assets. The US Federal Reserve's decision to further taper its quantitative easing programme did not help. Where exactly are the stresses in EM? Will they go away or derail global economic growth?\n\nFragility of the Fragile Five\n\nInvestors are paying close attention to a group of EM countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa) - increasingly known as the \"Fragile Five\". These countries are seen to be vulnerable to the effects of tighter monetary conditions, given their reliance on foreign capital to support growth and fund their deteriorating current account deficits (see Chart 2).\n\nSpecifically, South Africa's economy continues to grow at a tepid rate with 2013's 2 per cent growth constrained by ongoing strikes in the factory and mining sectors and its current account deficit widening in Q3 2013 to reach 6.8 per cent of GDP, its highest level in five years.\n\nThe rand continues to decline, recently falling to a 51/2-year low, posing risks to the already troubling inflation outlook. Meanwhile, with Turkish markets already suffering from the Prime Minister's corruption investigation, Turkey's lira plunged to record lows.\n\nWhile the Central Bank of Turkey's recent rate hike was a surprise to many, it has yet to convince investors and rebuild the credibility of the central bank. In contrast, India and Brazil are making incremental improvements. India's current account deficit is projected to improve, while the new central bank governor won the confidence of many.\n\nBrazil has also embarked on a rapid tightening cycle to tame inflationary pressures and rolled out a programme to intervene against excessive Brazilian real weakness.\n\nBeyond the Fragile Five\n\nApart from the \"Fragile Five\", we also see weakness in other EM countries. For instance, Argentina's decision to scale back its long-standing intervention to support the peso recently resulted in the currency's steepest plunge since the 2002 financial crisis.\n\nVenezuela is also grappling with excessive annual inflation (56.2 per cent in 2013), international reserves at a 10-year low, and a stressed currency control system.\n\nSeparately, heightened political tensions in the likes of Thailand, Ukraine and Egypt are affecting their domestic economies. The resignation of Ukraine's Prime Minister and the newly approved constitution in Egypt could lead to some renewed optimism. However, the situation in Thailand remains in a deadlock after the protest-plagued election.\n\nNot all EMs are in a bad shape\n\nWhile we see risks in a number of EM countries, the EM bloc as a whole is in a qualitatively better position than it was 20 years ago with lower external debt and healthier account balances. Countries such as South Korea and Mexico are also well-positioned to benefit from the improving growth of global/developed market economies.\n\nBarclays is projecting South Korea's GDP to grow from 2.8 per cent in 2013 to 4.1 per cent in 2014. The country is also less vulnerable to liquidity outflows given its current account surplus and significant FX reserves. Mexico's GDP growth is projected to nearly treble from 2013's 1.3 per cent to 2015's forecast 3.8 per cent.\n\nThis growth will be aided by increasing foreign investments with major multinational companies recently announcing US$7 billion of commitments. This influx is indicative of investors' confidence in the new economic reforms passed by Mexico's president.\n\nGlobal recovery intact\n\nBased on Barclays' analysis, the G-3's (that is, US/euro area/Japan) export/GDP exposure to the stressed EM economies is around 2 per cent. Hence, while the stressed EM markets may have some negative impact on growth, they are not likely to make a significant dent on the global economy.\n\nIn fact, China could be more critical in calming the EM jitters as the country is not only the world's largest EM economy, but also one of the biggest buyers of exports from other EMs. While the recent weak PMI readings suggest that growth will ease further in H1 2014, we expect momentum to pick up in H2.\n\nWhile some may be worried about China's debt situation, the risks should be contained as the central government has a strong balance sheet and the debt is mostly owned by domestic entities.\n\nThe EM jitters may linger and cause more market volatility in the near term. While it is difficult to ascertain when the jitters will go away, we look for signs of incremental improvement in the stressed EM economies (such as FX/political stability) that would help to calm the markets.\n\nMore importantly, our view on global growth recovery remains unchanged - and any further indiscriminate selling of risk assets would only represent an even more attractive investment opportunity, in our opinion.\n\nThe writer is equity strategist at Barclays\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM", "images": []}

We finished the year ahead of the majority of our performance targets and will continue to execute our strategy in a disciplined manner in order to ensure the firm's long-term success.\"\n\nThe UBS wealth management arm posted a 17 per cent increase in pre-tax profit against the outcome in 2012, reaching 2.4 billion Swiss francs.\n\nIts Americas wealth management activities, which are accounted for separately, notched up pre-tax profit of US$991 million.\n\nNet new money in the group's wealth management businesses increased to 54 billion Swiss francs.\n\nAnd the UBS investment bank division, at the core of the restructuring programme, posted pre-tax profit of 2.5 billion francs.\n\nUBS, which is the top player in the Swiss banking sector, said its performance accelerated in the fourth quarter, with net profit reaching 917 million francs, a full 59 per cent higher than the 577 million recorded in the previous three months.\n\nWhile the first quarter tends to see activity speed up further in the banking sector, UBS was downbeat about the current market outlook.\n\n\"At the start of the first quarter of 2014, many of the underlying challenges and geopolitical issues that we have previously highlighted remain,\" it said.\n\n\"The continued absence of sustained and credible improvements to unresolved issues in Europe, continuing US fiscal and monetary policy issues, emerging markets fragility and the mixed outlook for global growth would make improvements in prevailing market conditions unlikely.\"\n\nBut despite the overall environment, UBS underlined that it expected its wealth management business to continue attracting new money. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

The benchmark index has lost 6.7 per cent so far this year.\n\nSome US$12 billion moved out of emerging markets last month, with retail investors leading the charge, the Financial Times reported.\n\n\"Right now it's pretty bad. Every market is falling, the sell-off is pretty sharp,\" an investment banker told The Business Times. \"It will take a bit of time (for the market to settle), so I'm not that confident that Q1 is going to be easy for IPOs.\"\n\nThe weak market, coupled with the Chinese New Year break and the poor performance of IPOs this year, has thrown a spanner in the works where looking for cornerstone investors is concerned. \"Most of the IPOs that we have seen are still working towards cornerstone,\" the banker added. \"It's not a great time to cornerstone (an IPO) as that would need a better market.\"\n\nThe selection of cornerstone investors is important to the success of an IPO and its after-market trading performance, said Matthew Song, HSBC's head of equity markets in South-east Asia.\n\n\"Given the current sentiment in the market, and without a good set of cornerstone institutional investors, issuers will find it challenging to complete the order-taking stage from institutional investors,\" he warned.\n\nJanuary's four IPOs, which raised $433.3 million in gross proceeds, have seen mixed fortunes so far, with Catalist listings finishing higher on their trading debut.\n\nLuxury car dealer EuroSports Global, the first off the starting block, has since slipped below its offer price of 28 cents. The stock closed at 23 cents yesterday.\n\nOn the flip side, offshore oil and gas contractor Kim Heng has benefited from the market's warm reception to the oil and gas support services sector. It ended at 29 cents yesterday, above its offer price of 25 cents.\n\nShares in medical oncology firm MedTalk Group soared to 82 cents on its first day of trading last Thursday, quadrupling its offer price of 20 cents. It closed at 68 cents yesterday.\n\nThe only mainboard listing, OUE Commercial Reit (OUE C-Reit), closed unchanged at 80 cents on its trading debut, but it has since gone underwater.\n\nThis prompted one of its bookrunners, Standard Chartered Bank, to buy around 14 million shares - or 33.5 per cent of the 41.6 million units available to the bank under the over-allotment option - through five stabilising actions between Jan 27 and Feb 3. The stock closed at 78.5 cents yesterday.\n\n\"OUE C-Reit coming down was a bit of disappointment, considering that they had already tied up with anchor shareholders,\" said CIMB's Mr Goh, adding that the decline in the counter could be due to institutional investors' aversion to the Reit sector.\n\n\"The institutional investors that CIMB has generally are not very convinced about the Reit story,\" he added.\n\n\"So if they're not going to be too excited, retail investors will not be as well.\"\n\nBT understands that OUE C-Reit, whose cornerstone investors included RHB Asset Management, a subsidiary of Malaysia's RHB Investment Bank, and an investment firm wholly owned by Chinese property tycoon Tong Jinquan, did not attract much interest from institutional investors.\n\nBut it may not be time to write off listings of Reits or yield stocks just yet, bankers cautioned.\n\n\"There are people who take a view and say these are short-term issues,\" said another banker. \"The verdict is still out. It doesn't mean that subsequent Reits or yield plays will do badly.\"\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that pricing for upcoming listings, especially for Reits and business trusts, would come under pressure.\n\n\"Clearly an IPO that is not performing well is going to influence the pipeline and the pricing of the next IPOs,\" said the first banker.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Lawrence Wong, Singapore Exchange (SGX) head of listings, said in a statement yesterday: \"We constantly receive interest from international companies with an Asian focus to list on SGX given our positioning as the gateway to the region.\"\n\nBut he declined comment on Lotte. \"It is not our practice to publicly comment on our dealings with specific companies,\" he said.\n\nLotte's business includes department stores, supermarkets and cinemas. The company is listed on the Korea Exchange as well as the London Stock Exchange.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts have flocked to SGX in recent years, given its established regulatory framework for such vehicles. Firms can raise capital by selling their cash-generating assets to investors through a business trust or Reit framework.\n\nBankers have commented that there is still ample liquidity in the market and in a low interest rate environment, investors still like the yields that Reits and trusts offer. However, in recent weeks, global markets have been hit by a bout of volatility. Concerns about US tapering its bond purchases have also hit yield instruments. Higher rates make them comparatively less attractive, and also cause higher refinancing costs for the debt they hold.\n\nInvestors are thus becoming more discerning. They are looking more for a growth story instead of just reaching out for yield, bankers said.\n\nDeloitte chief of operations for clients and markets Ernest Kan said yesterday that the Lotte listing should do fine, even though uncertainty in the market is making people cautious and there are corporate bonds competing for investors' attention.\n\n\"I still believe the fundamentals are strong, meaning there's liquidity in the market,\" he said. Prices are still holding up for some trusts and Reits launched last year, he noted.\n\n\"People don't buy into Reits and trusts for trading, they are going for income yield.

Japan's Nikkei 225 was the worst hit, plunging 610.66 points or 4.2 per cent to a four- month low of 14,008.47, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which was closed on Monday, lost 637.65 points or 2.9 per cent at 21,397.77.\n\nHere, the Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 25.15 points or 0.9 per cent to 2,965.80, bringing its loss for the year to 202 points or 6.4 per cent. Turnover was a moderately heavy two billion units worth $1.3 billion, of which $807 million or 62 per cent was done in the 30 STI components.\n\nThe selling in Japan was led by exporters on concerns that a rising yen would hurt their earnings. The yen has risen from about 104.2 a fortnight ago to 101.35 yesterday, a gain of almost 3 per cent.\n\nUS reports said Western markets were rocked on Monday following the release of soft US manufacturing data and after a fresh warning about the federal debt ceiling. The S&P 500 plunged 2.3 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 326 points or 2 per cent to 14,008.47.\n\nThe US's ISM (Institute of Supply Management) index, widely used as a gauge of manufacturing activity, suffered a sharp fall from 56.5 in December to 51.3 in January, a level consistent with only modest growth in output, thus casting doubt on the strength of the US recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, US debt and fiscal worries which paralysed the federal government in October and led to its two-week shutdown were revived on Monday, when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issued an urgent call for Congress to raise the debt ceiling by the end of this month. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 2.6 per cent, the same level during October's shutdown.\n\nBrokers here were not overly surprised at the selling, given the weak sentiment surrounding EMs since the US Federal Reserve made it clear last September that it would taper its QE monetary stimulus, money which had been instrumental in driving up asset prices in EMs. Since the start of the year, markets and currencies from Brazil, Argentina, Turkey and Asia have all come under pressure, forcing many of their central banks to tighten monetary policy to halt capital flight.\n\nLast week, Turkey's central bank jacked up its benchmark one-week repo rate from 4.5 to 10 per cent in a bid to defend its currency.

The purchase of International Business Machines Corp's low-end x86 server unit delivers corporate clients, while the following deal for Google's Motorola Mobility was criticised for adding an unprofitable business with shrinking sales.\n\n\"We expect a negative impact on Lenovo's net profit - at least in the near term - from the acquisition of Motorola Mobility,\" Morgan Stanley analysts led by Grace Chen said in a Jan 31 report. \"It will take some time before Lenovo turns the business profitable.\"\n\nThe purchase of Motorola Mobility is \"a necessary evil\" to help Lenovo boost its US presence and patent portfolio, Arthur Hsieh, an analyst at UBS, said in a Feb 3 report.\n\nStill, Motorola Mobility is expected to lose money for the next three fiscal years, and that will weigh on Lenovo's earnings, he said in downgrading the shares to neutral and lowering the price forecast to HK$10.30 from HK$12.\n\n\"The potential uncertainty in the MMI deal could offset the benefit from the IBM x86 deal,\" he wrote.\n\nLenovo, which has headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville, North Carolina, agreed to pay US$2.3 billion for IBM's low-end server unit on Jan 23, adding a business with wider profit margins than PCs and giving it about 14 per cent of the market.\n\nIt then agreed to buy Motorola Mobility for US$2.91 billion in cash and stock, adding a brand established in the US mobile market and creating the world's No 3 smartphone vendor.\n\nMotorola has reported falling sales as it lags behind Apple and Samsung Electronics in smartphone shipments.\n\n\"Execution risk is high and increasing competition creates concerns,\" Mark Po, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian in Hong Kong, said in a report yesterday. \"The integration of Motorola Mobility is likely to drag down overall profitability.\"\n\nThe PC market is coming off its worst year ever, with industry shipments dropping 10 per cent in 2013, according to researcher Gartner.\n\nLenovo maintained the No 1 spot with 18.1 per cent of the global PC market in 2013, helped by a 6.6 per cent increase in shipments, according to Gartner.

However, the complexity of the network required us to troubleshoot the numerous interlinked network entities. This systematic process was necessary to ensure effective restoration of services,\" the spokesman said.\n\nFull service was restored at 12.15pm, the telco said.\n\nIronically, the complexity of the network had been increased by M1's recent upgrades to its mobile network.\n\n\"Our preliminary investigations suggest that a call processing software issue had unexpectedly prevented our customers' devices from registering on the mobile network,\" M1 said.\n\nAs a \"goodwill gesture\", M1 is giving its customers one day of free mobile calls as well as local SMS and MMS services this Sunday.\n\n\"We are sorry for the inconvenience caused . . . We take this incident very seriously and, in addition to our own investigation, we will be appointing an independent expert to conduct a network architecture and connectivity review,\" said Karen Kooi, M1's CEO.\n\nYesterday evening, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) weighed in, saying on its Facebook page that it was \"concerned\" about the outage, considering the other ones that happened to M1 in the past year.\n\nThe most notable one on Jan 15 last year involved M1's 2G and 3G mobile services and lasted more than 60 hours. This brought a record-breaking fine of $1.5 million down on the telco's head.\n\nThis penalty was levied under the Service Resiliency Code, which carries a fine of up to $1 million or 10 per cent of a licensee's annual turnover, whichever is higher.\n\nIn its Facebook post, the IDA alluded to the same code yesterday, and said that it will carry out its own investigation before it decides what it will do next.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the following months, banks, led by Erste Group Bank AG's Banca Comerciala Romana SA and BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA, accelerated leu mortgage lending. It grew at a record annual pace of 90 per cent in December.\n\nRomania is providing US$4.2 billion in loan guarantees to first-time homebuyers such as Mr Popescu. The government is betting that borrowers in the European Union's (EU) second poorest country will accept higher payments in exchange for local currency loans that won't jump in cost if the leu plunges against the euro. In Mr Popescu's case, it's working.\n\n\"I got used to the idea,\" said Mr Popescu, who initially sought a loan in euros for his two-bedroom, 295,000 lei (S$112,990) Bucharest apartment before taking a leu-or-nothing offer for a government guarantee. \"My monthly payments went up by 300 lei, but they're fixed now and I don't expect any significant changes in the next few years.\"\n\nThe changes come after hundreds of thousands of homebuyers in neighbouring Hungary took out Swiss franc loans, only to be hurt by a slump in their own currency. The forint has depreciated by about 75 per cent since 2008, when most of the loans were issued.\n\nThe plan guarantees 50 per cent of the value of mortgages worth as much as 75,000 euros (S$130,000), with a 5 per cent downpayment. That reduces the risks for banks, allowing them to make cheaper loans. On Jan 8, the Romanian central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to a record 3.75 per cent, the latest in a string of cuts that began in July 2013.\n\nThe revised government programme is intended to protect leu-earning homebuyers against exchange rate swings, such as when the leu plunged 12 per cent against the euro at the end of 2008, driving up euro-denominated loan payments.\n\nThe guarantees - US$602 million for this year alone - are also designed to counteract a squeeze from Western lenders that have cut back euro funding to their Romanian operations before the release of EU-wide stress-test results in November.\n\nRomania has lagged behind Poland and Hungary in limiting foreign-currency loans. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban effectively banned such debt in 2010, while Poland allows it only for borrowers whose incomes are based in foreign currencies.\n\nAfter coming to power in 2010, Mr Orban effectively banned foreign-currency mortgages. It was part of a series of measures aimed at phasing out such loans and helping hundreds of thousands of Hungarians whose repayments of predominantly Swiss-franc denominated loans ballooned in the aftermath of the global financial the crisis.\n\nIn 2011, he forced banks to swallow US$1.7 billion in losses on the early repayment of some mortgages at below-market exchange rates, expanded a programme allowing debtors to temporarily repay their mortgages at fixed exchange rates and pledged to take further steps to eliminate all such loans.\n\nAbout 100,000 Romanian borrowers took part in the government's initial four-year programme, with the state guaranteeing loans amounting to about four billion euros.\n\nThat's good news for developers struggling to recover from a real estate collapse that left the Bucharest skyline marked by half-finished office buildings and idle cranes. On the city's outskirts, hundreds of buildings and houses stand empty along unpaved roads.\n\n\"This programme is the best idea the state has had in years,\" Alexandru Tiron, a construction engineer, told Bloomberg. \"It will be extended. If not, the construction market will plunge again and take the entire economy with it.\"\n\nBad loans in Romania stood at 21.7 per cent of all lending at the end of October, the sixth-worst ratio in the world in 2012, according to World Bank data. That has left credit scarce.\n\nThe state-guaranteed loans are the exception. With a default rate of 0.1 per cent, they now account for 90 per cent of new mortgages, according to Alpha Bank Romania SA chief executive officer Sergiu Oprescu. \"The programme had a pretty good start, but lately it has received a very strong boost from the central bank's rate cuts,\" he said. \"It totally eliminates the foreign-exchange risk.\"\n\nThe average leu mortgage rate fell to 6.11 per cent at the end of last year, less than half of 2009's record high of 14.76 per cent, central bank data show. In comparison, euro mortgage rates averaged 5.87 per cent, down from 9.17 per cent at the end of 2008.\n\nNow local developers are rebuilding after a two-year recession starting in 2009 that torpedoed projects backed by international companies such as Charlemagne Capital Ltd and Asmita SA.\n\nThe 120 million euro Asmita Gardens project in Bucharest, Romania's biggest private residential investment, failed in 2011. A few streets away, developer Tiron sold out his third apartment building in six months at about 800 euros per square metre. That's 24 per cent less than today's prices at Asmita's project, built before the crisis.\n\n\"There's an extraordinary demand for cheaper, smaller apartments,\" Andreea Comsa, managing director of real estate broker Premier Estate SA said. \"Local developers are buying land and building tailor-fit houses for the programme. They sell very quickly.\"\n\nThe average apartment price in Romania plunged to 898 euros per square metre at the end of 2013 from more than 2,000 euros in 2008, an index from property listings website and consultancy imobiliare.ro shows. Still, the government's First Home programme may be keeping prices artificially high, according to Andrei Radulescu, an analyst at Romanian brokerage SSIF Broker SA.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump over 5% after confirmation of its student and worker accommodation Reit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Officials acted because India hasn't fixed safety deficiencies found in earlier assessments, the FAA said on Friday.\n\nUnited said hours after the FAA announcement that it had halted the use of its booking codes on Jet Airways flights, a practice that lets fliers arrange a seamless trip on jets from both carriers. The move took effect on Saturday, and passengers were being rebooked, Chicago-based parent United Continental Holdings Inc said.\n\nUnited's action marked some of the first fallout from the FAA designating India as Category 2 from Category 1, the same standing as Zimbabwe, Paraguay and Indonesia. That was a blow to India's bid to boost the aviation industry after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government eased investment rules and spent billions of dollars to upgrade more than a dozen airports.\n\n\"US and Indian aviation officials have developed an important working relationship as our countries work to meet the challenges of ensuring international aviation safety,\" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said. \"The FAA is available to work with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to help India regain its Category 1 rating.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc also withdrew its booking code from Jet Airways, covering one domestic route flown by the Indian airline. Passengers already have been re-accommodated, said Andrea Huguely, a spokeswoman for Fort Worth, Texas-based American.\n\nReciprocal code-share arrangements between Category 2 nations and US carriers aren't supported by the FAA, according to the agency's website. State-owned Air India Ltd and Jet Airways are the only two Indian carriers serving the US.\n\nIndia's Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh has expressed his disappointment with the downgrade. Only two of 31 aviation issues raised by the FAA remain unresolved, Mr Singh said.\n\nIndian carriers have ordered hundreds of aircraft from Boeing Co and Airbus Group NV as they expand in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world. New Delhi's decision in September 2012 to ease investment rules attracted AirAsia Bhd and Singapore Airlines Ltd to start new ventures in the nation of 1.2 billion people.\n\nUnder the International Convention on Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), each country is responsible for the safety oversight of its own carriers, according to the FAA website. The FAA assesses the civil aviation authority of each country that has airlines operating to the US.\n\nA December 2012 audit of India by the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization identified \"deficiencies\", the FAA said in its release. Afterward, the FAA began its own assessment of India's DGCA, according to the release.\n\n\"The FAA has consulted extensively with the DGCA and other relevant Indian government ministries during its evaluation, including consultations in India in September and early December, and meetings this week in Delhi,\" the FAA said.\n\nThe Indian government \"has made significant progress\" in addressing the shortfalls identified by the FAA, the agency said.\n\nThe FAA's downgrade \"is of significant interest\" to the European Union (EU), Dale Kidd, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in Brussels. While the EU Safety List and FAA's rankings aren't directly linked, the Europeans will study the US findings, Mr Kidd said. The EU Air Safety Committee will study the issue at its next meeting in March, he said.\n\nAn International Aviation Safety Assessment by the FAA determines whether a foreign authority's oversight of its carriers providing service to the US conforms to international standards. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

OCBC Bank may have to contend with volatility from its insurance unit, while United Overseas Bank (UOB) could post the lowest net profit growth or even a slight decline, given its relatively larger exposure to Thailand and Indonesia.\n\nEarnings drivers for the trio in Q3 - flat margins, better loans growth and flat credit costs with seasonal higher staff costs - should have continued into Q4, analysts reckoned.\n\n\"Singapore banks' share prices have slipped in 2014, more in anticipation of credit and liquidity strains spilling over from the emerging economies than on any concerns over a seasonally weak Q4,\" said CIMB research head Kenneth Ng.\n\n\"We expect the banks' Q4 2013 to be similar to Q3 2013 - flat net interest margins (NIMs), a pick-up in US dollar loans, muted credit costs growth, albeit with lower non-interest incomes and seasonally higher cost ratios,\" he said.\n\n\"Any positive surprises are likely to come in loan volumes,\" added Mr Ng.\n\nHis Q4 core net profit estimates are: DBS $868 million, up 14.2 per cent year on year; OCBC $688 million, up 3.7 per cent; and UOB $676 million, down 2.8 per cent.\n\nCredit Suisse research analyst Anand Swaminathan also does not expect any big surprises.\n\n\"We expect overall sector profit to be down one per cent quarter on quarter but up 10 per cent year on year, mainly driven by a seasonal weakness in non-interest income,\" he said. \"No other big surprises are likely.\"\n\nKey earnings driver performance is likely to remain mostly stable, with flat margins quarter on quarter, a slightly better loan-growth performance driven by Singapore, continued cost discipline and flat credit costs, noted Mr Swaminathan.\n\nHis Q4 core net profit expectations are: DBS $859 million, up 13 per cent year on year; OCBC $719 million, up 8.4 per cent; and UOB $741 million, up 6.7 per cent.\n\nAt the results briefing, analysts will be keeping their eyes peeled on the resilience of the banks' strong loans growth last year, especially business loans, which have helped mitigate the slowdown in home loans.\n\nBank credit expanded 17 per cent last year, up from 2012's 12.7 per cent growth, despite a sharp drop in new mortgage sales.\n\nBusiness loan growth of 22.9 per cent (2012: 18 per cent) was on the back of a strong gain in general commerce loans (2013: 32.4 per cent; 2012: 17.5 per cent), which picked up strongly in Q4, noted Ng Wee Siang, Maybank Kim Eng Singapore head of research.\n\n\"Dampening the effect was a decelerating consumer loan growth of 8.9 per cent in 2013 (2012: 15.0 per cent), which was dragged down by a slowing housing loan growth of 9.5 per cent (2012: 15.9 per cent); slowest in 4.5 years,\" said Mr Ng.\n\nThe big surge in general commerce was fuelled by US dollar loans for trade finance, reinforcing Singapore's position as the funding centre for the region.\n\n\"Indeed, the new mortgage loan growth is slowing every month, but that has not proved to be a dampener on overall credit growth at all,\" observed Mr CIMB's Mr Ng.\n\nIn the second half of last year, loan growth was increasingly driven by non-Singapore dollar loans, business loans and loans to fund trade finance activities, he said.\n\nMr Ng is concerned about trade loans should there be a significant slowdown in Asia, as most of the current loan growth opportunities lie in short-term, trade-financing type loans.\n\n\"In our opinion, a marked slowdown in Asian economies is more likely to impact the banks' earnings via a negative loan growth from trade loans (as some of these working capital requirements come off) and the corresponding evaporation of the non-interest income (such as trade fees and treasury income).\n\n\"We think that this is a trend to watch out for in the first half of 2014,\" said Mr Ng.\n\nAnother area of focus will be the outlook for margins and guidance on asset quality and growth in Asean markets.\n\n\"My sense is that improved margins won't come until 2016, as interest rates are not likely to go up until mid-2015,\" said Credit Suisse's Mr Swaminathan.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see whether DBS guides for a better NIM recovery (versus peers) in FY2014, driven by increasing demand for fixed-rate loans,\" he said.\n\nFor UOB and OCBC, he wants guidance on their Asean growth and asset quality.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

BCA urges the industry to continue to diligently look for alternative sources and diversify,\" the government agency said.\n\nGranite aggregate, which is hard stones crushed into small pieces, is mixed with cement and water to make concrete, a widely used material in building structures.\n\nIndonesia is a major supplier of granite aggregate to Singapore. But since Jan 10, granite aggregate has not been allowed to be shipped from Indonesian jetties.\n\nThe stoppage happened at around the same time that Indonesia banned a wide range of minerals from being exported globally. It is understood that there is no specific ban on shipping granite to Singapore.\n\nRegulations issued by the Indonesian government had said that exports of raw or unprocessed granite out of Indonesia were not allowed, and only granite that had been shaped, cut or processed can be exported. As a result, various construction projects in Singapore faced delays.\n\nIn 2012, a week-long granite shortage occurred when supplies from Indonesia were temporarily disrupted. And in 2007, an overnight ban on exports of sand - a vital concrete ingredient - sparked a \"sand crisis\" that saw construction activity islandwide grind to a halt.\n\nYesterday, BCA added that it has already briefed various industry groups like developers, architects, engineers, contractors, quantity surveyors and project managers, on the stockpile release.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The new orders sub-index nudged down to 50.9 from December's 51.0.\n\nThe data, in line with expectations, echoed the manufacturing PMI published on Sunday which also fell for a third consecutive month to a five-month low of 50.5.\n\nThe same index published by investment bank HSBC contracted in January to below the 50 point threshold for the first time in six months to 49.5.\n\nAnalysts say part of the decline in activity was due to the negative effect of the Chinese New Year which started last Friday and sees China's millions of factories and workshops shut down for close to a month.\n\nThey add, however, that the annual holiday which always distorts January-February data, does not mask a general slowdown of the economy hit by weak demand at home as government measures to restructure come into effect.\n\n\"We think that some part of the weakness was due to the Chinese New Year holiday. However, together with the (Final) Markit/HSBC reading, it is getting clearer that the economic slowdown has begun again,\" Yao Wei, economist with Societe Generale said in a note.\n\nChina recorded annual GDP growth of 7.7 per cent in 2013, the government said in mid-January, indicating it maintained its slowest expansion in more than a decade. The official target for this year has yet to be released, but most economists expect it to remain unchanged at 7.5 per cent.\n\nChina's leaders laid out an ambitious plan for reform last November with the aim of restructuring the economy onto a more sustainable path. Though all agree a transition is inevitable, economists say this will mean slower growth rates as the government weans banks off years of cheap credit which has led to inherent overcapacity and bubbles in the property sector. The government also has to deal with risks of accumulated local government debt and systemic risks from the shadow-banking sector.\n\n\"We maintain our view that the growth momentum will trend down somewhat in Q1, and see that the upcoming structural reforms could continue to weigh on the economic growth over the next few quarters,\" Liu Li Gang, chief economist for Greater China at Australian investment bank ANZ, said in a note.\n\n\"It will be wise for the authorities to set a GDP growth target at 7 per cent, rather than 7.5 per cent as it did in the previous two years, so that more efforts could be devoted to implementing reform measures,\" he added.\n\nThe question is how much of a slowdown the government is ready to accept without resorting to support measures which would mean more state-led investment.\n\nThough officially there is no talk of any stimulus measures and credit growth is still slowing, analysts say China's leaders are wary of any instability that could come with weaker growth and will not hesitate to intervene.\n\nSince June, the central bank has had to deal with three liquidity crises, and economists say credit tightening could continue well into the first quarter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Orders for motor vehicles fell by the most in five months. Non-defence aircraft and parts orders fell 17.5 per cent.\n\nOrders excluding transportation gained 0.2 per cent after rising 0.3 per cent in November. There were gains in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for primary metals fell and bookings for computers and electronic products posted their biggest drop since June 2012.\n\nFactory activity is expected to slow down early this year after output grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the fourth quarter. That will also hold back economic growth after brisk expansion in the second half of the year.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported on Monday that its index of national factory activity dived to an eight-month low in January, with orders recording their largest drop in more than 30 years.\n\nBut manufacturing is not slowing as sharply as suggested by the ISM survey, with bad weather accounting for some of the slowdown. There also has been a steady rise in order backlogs.\n\nUnfilled orders at the nation's factories rose 0.4 per cent in December to their highest level since the series started in 1992 and were up 0.9 per cent in November.\n\nEconomic activity has cooled off a bit in part due to unseasonably cold weather across much of the country and payback after the second half's robust 3.7 per cent annual growth pace, which was driven by inventories, consumer spending and trade.\n\nThe Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, manufactured products expected to last three years or more, dropped 4.2 per cent instead of the 4.3 per cent fall reported last month. Durable goods orders excluding transportation fell 1.3 per cent and not 1.6 per cent as previously reported.\n\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - declined 0.6 per cent instead of the previously reported 1.3 per cent drop. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

What's been lacking is aviation infrastructure reaching to the nation's farthest corners.\n\nMr Moreira Franco has asked Congress for subsidies for airfares, for the renovation of old airports and new construction, and for the creation of airlines and support of regional units at existing carriers, he said. He added the subsidies have yet to be defined and are being discussed by the Treasury Department.\n\n\"Some products that are of higher value or are perishable justify air transport,\" Mr Moreira Franco said.\n\nThe government estimated that the regional plan would generate 7.3 billion reais (S$3.8 billion) in private investment, according to EPL, the government's planning and logistics company.\n\nOne beneficiary of having a nearby cargo airport would be agricultural-equipment maker Agco Corp, which has a factory in Santa Rosa in Rio Grande do Sul state, Mr Moreira Franco said. The city is almost 1,200 km from Sao Paulo. Duluth, Georgia-based Agco declined to comment.\n\nBanco do Brasil SA, Latin America's largest bank by assets, is the financing agent and operating arm for the regional-airports project, Mr Moreira Franco said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Located near Yangon, Myanmar's commercial centre and former capital, the airport is expected to handle 12 million passengers annually.\n\nThe value of the project was estimated by the market to be around US$1 billion.\n\nLast August, Yongnam's consortium lost out in the bidding to a consortium led by South Korea's Incheon International Airport Corp, though it was named as back-up tenderer.

Hence, shareholders should exercise caution when dealing in Yongnam shares.\"\n\nYongnam closed at 22.5 cents, down half a cent, before the announcement was out.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, speaking in Abu Dhabi, said his government, which has helped prop up Alitalia, wouldn't impose conditions for an agreement.\n\n\"This would definitely be a shot in the arm for a carrier that has struggled for a while now,\" said Sidanth Rajagopal, a Dubai-based partner at Clyde & Co. \"Getting the best practices of Etihad and the money will be good for the airline.\"\n\nBuying a stake in Alitalia would let Mr Hogan tap a major Western European economy that has attracted airlines including Emirates and low-cost carrier EasyJet plc as they seek to capitalise on the local airline's woes.\n\nAir France KLM-Group, previously Alitalia's biggest shareholder, declined to support a capital increase last year after losses ballooned at the Italian partner and a turnaround effort failed to bear fruit.\n\nEtihad, Alitalia and their advisers are working on a joint strategy, according to a statement. Italy \"will do all it can\" during the 30 days to support an Etihad-Alitalia deal, said Mr Letta, who is in the Persian Gulf for several days.\n\nEtihad, which made a series of minority investments in carriers spanning Ireland to Australia as part of its growth strategy, declined to provide details of a possible investment. The company had previously said that the two sides were talking.\n\nAny issues that may prevent establishing an appropriate business plan \"will have to be resolved to ensure the plan can be implemented to move Alitalia to sustainable profitability\", it said in a statement.\n\nEtihad is considering a cash contribution of about 300 million euros (S$519 million) to unprofitable Alitalia, people familiar with the talks have said.\n\nAir France, which owned 25 per cent of Alitalia, late last year declined to invest further when Alitalia was seeking to raise funds, saying the Italian carrier hadn't met its conditions. Air France declined to comment on Etihad's announcement.\n\nEtihad has bought a 24 per cent stake in India's Jet Airways and a 49 per cent stake in Air Serbia. The carrier increased its stake in Virgin Australia by 10 per cent. It also holds a 29 per cent stake in Air Berlin, 40 per cent of Air Seychelles, 3 per cent of Aer Lingus, and recently added a stake in a Swiss regional carrier.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for Etihad to establish a European presence,\" said Mr Rajagopal. \"It has a stake in Air Berlin and a Swiss-based airline, but a full service legacy carrier would be great for Etihad as well.\n\n\"Alitalia was a great airline though it has gone through tough times.

It closed at 2,990.95 points, down 36 points or 1.2 per cent.\n\nWhile analysts say it is difficult to predict how much more the market will fall, they see value as the fundamentals of a recovering global economy and stable Singapore dollar have not changed.\n\nIn a note to clients as markets opened, DBS Group Research noted that the STI was trading below the 3,050-point level that marked an attractive level of about 13 times forward earnings.\n\n\"Any downside below this level in the near term is likely temporary and we expect it to hold around the 3,000 level,\" DBS said.\n\n\"Amid the latest currency turmoil that befalls some emerging markets, Singapore continues to be a safe haven given its strong current account surplus position, stable Singapore dollar and low political risk.\"\n\nTechnical analyst Rieve Ko, a remisier at UOB Kay Hian, said indicators do not point to the STI being oversold yet, and the index might fall further in tandem with US markets. February is statistically a bad month for US markets and fund managers might continue to sell in the near term, he added.\n\n\"The next support level is 2,980. If the STI is not able to hold on to that, I expect it will go down to 2,920 to 2,950,\" Mr Ko said. But at levels closer to 2,900 points, he would start picking up beaten down blue chips, he said.\n\n\"I remain bullish for the medium term of six months. Interest rates are still going to stay low for the foreseeable future and global economies are recovering.\"\n\nVoyage Research deputy head of research Ng Kian Teck said the 3,000-point mark is a key support level and if markets trade below that, he sees the next support level at 2,960 points.\n\nDMG & Partners head of research Terence Wong said: \"I do think markets should rebound at some point this year. The Singapore dollar will be a lot more stable compared to our neighbours' currencies. In the end, fundamentals should prevail.\"\n\nThe 3,000-point support level had held last August, when emerging market currencies like the Indonesian rupiah and the Indian rupee came under attack. The last time the index traded below 3,000 points was for two weeks in November 2012, when the market was gripped by fears of slowing US growth due to a combination of expiring tax breaks and spending cuts dubbed the \"fiscal cliff\". European growth was also slowing. That month, commodities trader Olam International, an STI component, came under attack by short-seller Muddy Waters. The market did not trade below 2,930 points then.\n\nGo back further, and the STI last traded in the 2,800-point range and the upper 2,700s in May and June 2012, when investors dumped European bonds. They worried that pending Greek elections might mean an anti-bailout party taking power and the eurozone, in the midst of a debt crisis, would see its first exit.\n\nBut the market would go on to recover. A pro-bailout party was voted into power, and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi then calmed bond markets with his famous utterance that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the eurozone together. The STI would rise 20 per cent in 2012, closing at 3,167 points.\n\nIn 2013, the STI went on to a high of around 3,450 points in May. Fears from the US withdrawing its monetary stimulus and emerging market capital outflows into developed world markets then sent it back down. It closed the year back at 3,167 points.\n\nThis year, the global economy is expected to do better than 2013. Citibank projected global gross domestic product (GDP) growth to accelerate to 3.1 per cent this year, from 2.4 per cent last year, driven by a strong recovery in the US and Europe, and continued growth in emerging markets and China.\n\nAnalysts have targeted the STI to end 2014 at between 3,000 and 3,500 points. DMG, the most bullish, had a 3,480-point target. Top picks are banks, construction sector stocks, S-chips, commodities, transport and real estate developers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Sodani said 43 of these planes had already been financed.\n\nThe state-owned airline has been aggressively expanding its fleet and launching new routes as it looks to compete with other regional low-cost carriers such as Jazeera Airways and Air Arabia.\n\nThe carrier, which has launched flights to over 65 destinations so far, ordered a further 100 Boeing 737-MAX jets at the Dubai Air Show last November. Deliveries for these planes will begin in 2017.\n\nFlydubai has been relying on aircraft sale and lease-back arrangements, direct bank loans and other financing options so far to pay for plane deliveries.\n\nIt signed a financing deal worth US$228 million in November with a combination of international and local banks for six Boeing 737-800 aircraft being delivered in 2013-2014.\n\nEmirates, Dubai's flagship carrier, issued a US$1 billion amortising sukuk in March last year and is expected to conduct more sukuk issuance this year. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

A pilot shortage accelerated the decision to reduce flights, he said.\n\nNew federal regulations implemented last year require more flight experience from pilots than previously needed, resulting in a shortage of pilots across the industry.\n\nLocal officials had expressed concern that United would drop Cleveland because the airline has a hub in its headquarter city of Chicago, and because the two cities are relatively close to each other.\n\nBut United plans to keep pilot and flight attendant bases there as well as technical operations, Mr Smisek said.

The board meets regularly to discuss reviews and reports on the group's business and plans.\n\nLast Friday, it announced \"its intention to propose to the 2014 annual general meeting that Euleen Goh and Patricia Woertz be elected non-executive directors of the company from Sept 1, 2014, and June 1, 2014, respectively\". Ms Goh will be the first Singaporean and Asian to be appointed to the board.\n\nMs Goh, a chartered accountant with professional qualifications in banking and taxation, is non-executive director of DBS, CapitaLand and SATS. She is also chairman of the Singapore International Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to nurture active global citizens.\n\nShe previously held various senior management positions with Standard Chartered Bank and was its Singapore CEO from 2001 until 2006. \"In that role, she was responsible for driving the bank's corporate governance and strategic agenda in Singapore,\" Shell said.\n\nMs Woertz is chairman, CEO and president of Archer Daniels Midland Company in the US. She began her career as a certified public accountant before joining Gulf Oil in 1977 where she held various positions in refining, marketing, strategic planning and finance.\n\nFollowing the merger of Gulf and Chevron in 1987, she led international operations as president of Chevron Canada and, later, Chevron International Oil Company. And with the merger of Chevron and Texaco in 2001, she was appointed executive vice-president responsible for global refining, marketing, lubricant, and supply and trading operations.\n\nHer industry experience will be especially relevant with Shell now looking to restructure.\n\n\"Improving profitability in oil products and North American upstream (operations) will be a particular priority for us. We are restructuring both these portfolios with asset sales and potentially further writedowns,\" Mr van Beurden said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Lunch from 11.30am to 2.30pm; Dinner from 6pm to 10.30pm. Sat: 5pm to 1am\n\nTALK to any restaurateur and they will tell you: You can boast the finest ingredients; a chef who's got everyone from (Heston) Blumenthal to (Rene) Redzepi on speed dial; or a menu of such mind-bending proportions that even the napkins are auditioned before they are allowed to grace your lap.\n\nBut the real money has never been on what your customers eat - it's how much they drink. Ever notice a change of demeanour in your server/sommelier when you order the most expensive tasting menu but ask for mere sparkling water (or worse, hot water) to accompany it? It's not your imagination.\n\nWhich is why veteran F&B man Beppe de Vito may well be on to a good thing with his latest venture &Sons - a drink-centric but food-centred outpost in the Chinatown/CBD neighbourhood, with its captive market of work-frazzled, bar-loving office drones.\n\nIn Singapore, bars and restaurants tend to be mutually exclusive - watering holes can have great or cheap drinks but middling bar snacks, while restaurants have better food but often with over-priced alcohol. De Vito hits a nice middle ground with wines priced as low as $7 a glass and a small-plates menu that offers more than just spicy chicken wings and truffle fries.\n\nStyled after the Venetian bacaro (wine bar) in the faux-conservation enclave of China Square Central, &Sons certainly looks the part with its huge - 200-seater - indoor and outdoor premises staffed almost entirely by friendly Italians. The nice Italian girls who show us to our table; the friendly if awkward guy we call over to make recommendations who turns out to be one of the many chefs; the manager; even the chap who swipes your credit card.\n\nAdd the enticing display of home-cured salamis and expensive interiors and you're ready to say \"ciao\" (\"hello\" in Italian).\n\nConcept-wise, &Sons hits all the right notes. It's open all day till midnight. It's got the requisite hipster vibe and the clientele to match, nursing their beverage of choice in the al fresco area. The homemade salami (tasty and not too salty), imported hams and wide array of cheeses add to the artisanal aspect of the menu which suggests homemade (or at least well-chosen) goodness.\n\nThe hot food section leans towards comforting Italian favourites - pastas, simple grilled meats, seafood and the like. Prices are terrific, with vegetarian dishes pegged below $10, and everything hovering around the $15-$18 range, with the most expensive being the $26 wagyu tagliata with salsa verde - a beef salad by any other name.\n\nThe cooking is satisfactory, and while nothing really shines, everything has a minimum standard in taste and, more important, fresh and good quality ingredients are used. Take the tagliolini in nduja sauce and crabmeat.\n\nThis perfectly decent portion of skinny pasta dressed in a mildly spicy creamy sauce with a generous portion of crabmeat is a steal at $9, and you won't complain about paying $15 for al dente spaghetti carbonara with crisp chunks of pancetta and a gratinated blanket of fluffy, barely discernible sea urchin cream.\n\nYou might express some alarm at how rich a lot of the food is, with a liberal use of cream and heavy meat sauces. The paccheri ($15) is a veritable pasta swiss roll, its layers filled with a pork and truffle-scented sauce where the shredded meat is pretty much drowned in cream.\n\nSome respite comes from the fresh, meaty cod ($18) painted with a light smear of salsa rubra (a spicy Italian ketchup) and passed through a Josper grill so it's seared on the outside but milky soft within.\n\nEven then, that respite is shortlived once you dive into the cloud of cream and meringue bits that form the base of the salted caramel strawberry jubilee ($12), together with plump chewy cooked strawberries and vanilla ice cream. But this is dessert, so different rules apply.\n\nThis is by no means a dining destination that you make a special trip to because of the cooking. But as a convenient \"working-class\" hangout that you can afford to go to regularly where you're assured of affordable and quality food and drink whenever the urge strikes, &Sons had us at \"Ciao\".\n\nRating:\n\n6.5\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The median forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to 56. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.\n\nColder-than-normal temperatures in the US and weakness in some emerging markets helped slow factory demand last month. Sustained gains in consumer purchases, improvement in the labour market and a pick-up in capital spending will be needed to keep assembly lines humming in the world's biggest economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 per cent of the economy.\n\n\"Manufacturing activity was on a roll late in 2013, and a lot of economic activity and data has been suppressed somewhat because of the extraordinary weather that we've had,\" Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC in New York, said before the report. \"Right now it's just hard to figure out weather distortions and the fundamental developments and how to disentangle them.\"\n\nBut Bradley Holcomb, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing report, was more sanguine during a conference call with reporters.\n\n\"Comments from the panel this month show a mix of concern over severe weather conditions from the coldest January in many, many years,\" said Mr Bradley. \"The outlook for the rest of the year remains solid. This is a blip on the screen.\"\n\nAbout 55 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 156.92 points (1.00 percent) to 15,541.93. The broad-based S&P 500 sank 18.85 (1.06 percent) to 1,763.74, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 51.31 (1.25 percent) to 4,052.57.\n\nThe factory gauge averaged 53.9 for all of 2013. The ISM's new orders measure slumped to 51.2 last month, from 64.4 in December, while a gauge of production dropped to 54.8 from 61.7. The index of bookings waiting to be filled decreased to 48 in January from 51.5. The measure of factory employment fell to 52.3 from 55.8 in December.\n\nAnother report earlier also showed manufacturing grew less briskly in January after hitting an 11-month high the prior month as output and overseas demand slowed, an industry report showed on Thursday.\n\nFinancial data firm Markit said its final US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 53.7 in January, matching an advance reading earlier in the month. The index hit an 11-month high of 55.0 in December.\n\nOutput fell to 53.5, a four-month low, from 57.5. Some firms attributed the slower pace of growth to the extremely cold weather in large swaths of the country.\n\nNew export orders meanwhile declined for the first time since October.\n\nFirms took on new workers, however, for the seventh straight month, though the pace of hiring eased slightly, with the sub-index dropping to 53.2 from 54.0.\n\n\"The rate of job creation remained solid and was only slightly less marked than December's recent high,\" Markit said in a statement. \"Panel members attributed increased workforce numbers to rising production requirements.\"\n\nConstruction spending meanwhile rose modestly in December to its highest level since March 2009, as a jump in private residential projects offset weakness in the public construction sector.\n\nThe sector was up 0.1 per cent to an annual rate of US$930.5 billion, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.2 per cent. Construction spending in November was revised to show a 0.8 per cent rise instead of the previously reported 1.0 per cent increase.\n\nThe December construction spending data was buoyed by a 2.6 per cent jump in private residential construction. Overall private construction spending increased 1.0 per cent to an annual rate of US$663.9 billion, the highest level since December 2008.\n\nPublic construction spending, however, fell 2.3 per cent, its biggest drop in a year, with state and local outlays falling 2.7 per cent. Federal construction spending was up 2.0 per cent in the month. - Bloomberg, Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

UOB, however, experienced tepid growth and saw a fall in its global ranking.\n\nAccording to the annual Top 500 Banking Brands ranking, the three local banks collectively have the greatest brand value of any Asean country, with a total brand value of US$8.5 billion.\n\nBrand valuation agency Brand Finance calculated brand value by examining the royalties which a company would have had to pay to license its brand if the firm did not already own it. This form of calculation for intangible assets is known as the \"royalty relief\" method.\n\nDBS is ahead of its local peers with a brand value of US$4 billion this year, up 15.4 per cent from a year earlier. It is ranked 54th place among 500 global banks this year, up four positions from 58th place previously.\n\nDBS also took pole position among all Asean banks in terms of brand value, maintaining its top spot last year.\n\nOCBC came in second with a brand value of US$2.3 billion, a 35.7 per cent jump over the previous year. It is ranked 81st globally, rising several notches from 102nd position in 2013.\n\nUOB registered a much smaller growth in brand value this year, at US$2.2 billion, a 3.3 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\nUOB also fell two spots to 89th position globally.\n\nSamir Dixit, managing director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific, said the strength of these bank brands will be tested this year amid earning risks in the region.\n\n\"Constant downgrades to GDP estimates, coupled with the slowdown in mortgages, will likely create some business downside in the next few quarters,\" he warned.\n\n\"That is where a strong brand will play a significant role to help retain customers, reduce churn, build customer confidence and improve profitability\".\n\nWells Fargo remains the world's most valuable bank brand, with a brand value this year of just over US$30 billion, up 16.1 per cent over the previous year. It is followed by HSBC, with a brand value of US$26.9 billion, up 17.5 per cent year on year.\n\nWells Fargo overtook JP Morgan to become America's biggest bank by profitability last year. It has also enjoyed \"a more favourable reputation\" than its peers, Brand Finance noted. This is on the back of Wells Fargo's strength in traditional banking, and a perceived distance from Wall Street.\n\nOf the top 10 banks with the highest brand value, just three are from Asia, and specifically, China. ICBC stands at sixth spot, China Construction Bank is ninth, and Agricultural Bank Of China edged into the top 10 list this year, moving up one spot from 11th in 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A given search result will show all available flights, with fare comparisons and a breakdown, by flight segment, of amenities and services on a particular airplane.\n\nMr Saltzburg said: \"Customers will have transparency while they're making a booking decision between Flight A and Flight B, which might be the same cost. Are extra-legroom seats available for sale? That's clearly indicated on the initial results page.\"\n\nOther information is presented, such as seat pitch, flight on-time records, and availability of Wi-Fi and in-seat power ports, as well as seatback video and TV. Search results will also display what Mr Saltzburg called \"candid photos\" taken by customers on thousands of flights.\n\nFor many business travellers, the old days of faithfully booking the airline on which the traveller has loyalty status are waning, as airlines around the world put a price tag on many perks - better coach seats, upgrades and the like - that used to be given as awards for mileage-programme status.\n\nMeanwhile, as airlines have merged and begun sharing more flights through global alliances, the experience of booking an international trip, even on a favoured airline, has become more complicated.\n\n\"With airline consolidation, customers have more choice of who they can fly, even within their loyalty network, while the value of loyalty programmes has been diminishing year over year,\" Mr Saltzburg said.\n\nComparing and evaluating costs and services airline by airline, even airplane by airplane on specific flight segments, can be a real challenge.\n\nIn all flying classes, legroom and seating comfort are by far the main considerations passengers cite when asked about the most important in-flight amenity, assuming that they are given a choice.\n\nTripAdvisor, which was spun off in 2011 by the online booking company Expedia, operates more than a dozen other travel sites. They include SeatGuru.com, which provides diagrams and evaluations of airplane seats and cabin layouts by model of plane and airline.\n\nIn booking a flight, Mr Saltzburg said, the revamped features \"will help consumers understand they can have a very different experience at the same dollar, whether it's a four-hour flight or a 15-hour one\". - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

In Tribeca, a developer hired educators from the 92nd Street Y to design the basement playroom.\n\nBut perhaps nothing quite says modern chic like having a poet on board, like Howard Altmann, who wrote a short work, Once, as part of the marketing of the Schumacher, a new condo on Bleecker Street: \"Once,\" the poem closes, \"In the lifetime of a neighbourhood / An opportunity emerges / To make a singular imprint / In how we live.\"\n\nIt is old hat that a well- known architect and interior designer are required to play in New York's field of ultra-fancy real estate development. But with the intense competition to capture the US$3 million-plus buyer, the cast of characters and add-ons involved in the city's most luxurious new condominiums is growing ever longer.\n\n\"If you look back six or seven years ago, amenities were kind of Sheetrock boxes in the basement of buildings where you put a few treadmills and called it the gym,\" said Michael Iannacone, the executive at Related Cos who is leading the redevelopment of One Madison, a luxury building that will have, among various perks, a glass-walled steam room with a floor-to-ceiling view of Madison Park.\n\nThese days, expectations have skyrocketed. \"What people want is really a curated amenity package that's an extension of their home,\" Mr Iannacone said.\n\nJust as luxury consumers might want a Prada bag and a Chanel jacket, so might they respond to building amenities that reflect how they see themselves in the marketplace. That is the idea at 22 Central Park South, a newly overhauled landmark building with seven residences, priced from US$6.7 million to US$26.5 million, that is teaming up with Bergdorf Goodman, the department store around the corner.\n\nThe model apartment - the only completed unit so far - is stocked with brass sculptures, fine china and vintage books from Bergdorf's decorative furnishings floor. Sequined ball gowns glimmer in the master closet, and the store's 2013 catalogue rests on a table.\n\nThe touches are meant to illustrate what the developer, Elad Group, hopes will entice prospective foreign pied-\u00e0-terre buyers: the building's VIP relationship with Bergdorf's, whose staff will be on call for services including personal shopping and at- home salon treatments.\n\n\"This is our target customer anyway, and now we're having direct access to them,\" said Andrew Mandell, vice-president of decorative home at Bergdorf's.\n\nWith wealthy families increasingly choosing to stay in the city, rather than decamp to the suburbs, children's playrooms have taken on new significance. In Tribeca, for example, Taconic Investment Partners asked the 92nd Street Y, whose nursery school has among the city's most competitive admissions, to design the playroom for its new development on Laight Street, where apartments average US$2,700 per square foot.\n\nThe basement playroom at the development, Sterling Mason, will have reading and art stations and an area sensitive to the needs of nursing mothers.\n\n\"To some extent, there is only so much you can do different,\" said Dan McInerney, a vice-president at Taconic, given that buyers have come to expect a full complement of amenities from catering kitchens to gathering spaces. \"I think the way you do distinguish yourself is the level of service and doing things a little more thoughtfully.\"\n\nOne quirk to the latest emphasis on amenities is the level of name-dropping in a building's marketing as a way to indicate its quality. In part, this might be a reaction to the kind of luxury fatigue that emerged from the city's last condo building boom, from 2003 to 2007, when units began to look so standardised, with the same finishes, that developments \"felt more commoditised than I think was the intention\", said Jonathan J Miller, president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel.\n\nThese days, boutique condos are more apt to look like the Schumacher, a 20-unit condo at 36 Bleecker Street created from a repurposed 1800s industrial building, where units - known as mansions, penthouses or residences - range from US$3.5 million to US$25 million. Its website features photos of people who, while accomplished in their fields, are not exactly household names, like the public space curator (Cristina Grajales, who owns a SoHo gallery) and Altmann, the poet. \"There's a personal component to luxury that is always there, but right now you are seeing it marketed on steroids,\" Mr Miller said. Brochures list even obscure designers with such confidence, he said, that \"even if you've never heard of him, you don't really want to say that you've never heard of him.\"\n\nAltmann said he had participated in the building's marketing campaign to help support his non- commercial poetry. \"I'd like to imagine the day poets will get paid as many a painter has been paid to don some white shirt for some billboard overlooking the highways and biways of America,\" he said.\n\nRoto Group, a design firm based in Dublin, Ohio, that usually works on commissions like children's museums and aquariums, designed the playroom at Greenwich Lane, the luxury development rising on the former St Vincent's Hospital site in the West Village. The president, Joseph Wisne, said he was pleasantly surprised that the company's name was featured on the property's sleek website because \"it's pretty rare in our industry to be credited.\"\n\nWith the high prices of land and construction, developers use amenities to create value in new projects so that they can achieve the kind of pricing - often starting at around US$3,000 psf - that they seek. But there are several ways to do it.\n\nOne way is to go bigger, like at Extell Development's three West Side Manhattan condo towers - One Riverside Park is the latest - which share a 40,000 sq ft exercise space managed by a private gym and wellness firm called La Palestra. It has a 75-foot-long indoor pool, a bowling alley, a rock-climbing wall, a basketball court and a golf simulator room among its features.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

His choice of Jardine Matheson, the storied conglomerate of the Orient, is well thought out, because history is littered with the debris of failed or struggling diversified groups such as Korea's Daewoo or Brazil's EBX Group.\n\nYoma's diversification efforts offer exciting exposure to the expected growth of Myanmar's economy. But as the diversification becomes more substantial, the company and shareholders will have to watch out for the pitfalls of conglomerates.\n\nYoma, one of the purest listed Myanmar plays in the world, has been stepping up its diversification over the past year.\n\nIn February 2013, it moved into the auto after-sales service business through a joint venture with Mitsubishi. The company's presence in the auto business now includes distribution, not just for Mitsubishi, but also for Sumitomo Corp's Hino brand trucks and buses, as well as rental and leasing.\n\nAfter failing to win one of the two mobile network licences offered by the Myanmar government, Yoma has nevertheless kept a foot in the door. Ooredoo, one of the winners of those licences, has contracted a Yoma joint venture to help build the infrastructure equipment.\n\nYoma also has a balloon tourism business that is already up and running.\n\nAll of that is in addition to Yoma's traditional real estate business, which has been growing at a steady clip and has been expanding as well into mixed-use projects.\n\nWhat does all of this diversification mean for Yoma?\n\nThe immediate answer is not much, yet. A lot of the new businesses are still in extremely early stages, so real estate still accounts for about 90 per cent of Yoma's business. It remains to be seen how much of Yoma's ambitions today will actually be fulfilled.\n\nThe market has also been wary about over-optimism. After its stellar climb in 2012, Yoma's shares now appear to be stuck in a range. The stock has closed between 70 and 80 cents since October 2013, last changing hands at 73 cents on Thursday.\n\nIn general, those new businesses can be seen in a positive light.\n\nYoma happens to operate in what is expected to be a high-growth market in Myanmar. It also happens to be one of the most attractive joint venture partners for companies looking to build a presence in Myanmar.\n\nWhich means that from Mr Rickards' office in Myanmar, the world outside looks like juicy growth opportunities everywhere, and he just has to take his pick. That is an enviable position to be in, and it is perfectly reasonable that Mr Rickards and Yoma should strike when the right opportunity comes along. Why leave that money on the table for someone else?\n\nDiversification could also bring benefits in terms of risk management. If Yoma can spread out the sources of its revenue, it could be less exposed to cycles in one particular sector, such as property, or so the theory goes.\n\nThe risk argument, however, can be a little, well, risky. That is because the jury is still out on the benefits of conglomerates.\n\nConglomerates can get too big and complex, which adds costs and inefficiencies into the various businesses, rendering them less competitive than more focused rivals.\n\nMarkets also sometimes exact a \"conglomerate discount\" on diversified companies. The recent example of the Fraser and Neave group suggests that breaking up a conglomerate can be more profitable than keeping it together.\n\nThe fact is that conglomerates around the world have had vastly different fortunes. Among India's family empires, for example, the Tata group's strong growth over the past decade contrasts with the fortunes of the Reliance group, which found itself under a mountain of debt.\n\nBCG, the consulting group, has a theory about \"premium conglomerates\" that management quality is the difference maker.\n\nThat is a good place to start for Yoma shareholders. While it is still too early to say what Yoma's new ventures will eventually grow into, shareholders can at least begin to assess whether management has what it takes to run an empire.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Masirah Oil Limited, an indirectly owned subsidiary of Rex, had drilled to a depth of about 1,000 metres below the mean sea level, short of the target depth.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Masirah said it had successfully reached the planned depth of more than 3,000 metres in the second exploration well in Oman, where hydrocarbons were discovered in several formations.\n\nRex International holds a 65 per cent stake in Lime Petroleum, which in turn owns 64 per cent in Masirah. Masirah has a full stake in the Block 50 concession in the east of Oman.\n\nMasirah began drilling work on the second well early last month.\n\n\"The discovery of hydrocarbons in (the) second exploration well is a significant step towards the deepening of our knowledge and understanding of the offshore geology in the east of Oman, where no discovery has been made before,\" said Masirah chairman Hans Lidgren. \"The results from this well are vital for the future development of this block.\"\n\nThe development will boost investor confidence in the efficacy of the Rex Virtual Drilling technology, said DBS Vickers analyst Suvro Sarkar.\n\nRex's technology allows the firm to directly identify liquids such as oil, condensate gas and water in the ground from seismic data, compared with the industry practice of looking at geological structures from seismic data and making probability estimates of finding oil.\n\nThis boosts its success rate in exploratory drilling to more than 50 per cent, far above the global industry average of 10-15 per cent, it claimed.\n\nRex also said last month that Lime Petroleum had been awarded five new offshore licences in Norway, taking its portfolio there to 12 and 21 internationally.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It doesn't help us to build up the destination awareness and branding.\"\n\nThe season-ending WTA Championships will feature the top eight women's singles players and doubles pairs competing for a record prize purse of US$6.5 million.\n\nThe 10-day event will be held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium at the new $1.33 billion Singapore Sports Hub, which will open its doors this April.\n\nTens of thousands of spectators are expected to throng the venue to catch their favourite stars in action, with millions more tuning in \"live\" from around the world.\n\nSingapore will become the ninth city to host the WTA Championships in the event's 42-year history, following in the footsteps of Boca Raton (Florida), Los Angeles, Oakland, New York City, Munich, Madrid, Doha and Istanbul.\n\nWhen the Republic was unveiled as the new host last May, Mr Yeo said the tournament would net about $15 million in tourism receipts for each of the five instalments - a figure that he is sticking to today.\n\nTo attract as many visitors as possible to the October event, Mr Yeo said STB plans to reach out to countries where tennis is a popular sport, such as China, India, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nHe is confident that tennis fans will get their money's worth when it comes to the WTA Championships because the quality of the matches are \"as good, if not better\" than those at the four Grand Slam events such as Wimbledon or the US Open.\n\n\"We are working hard with the event promoter (World Sport Group), as well as the WTA, to make sure that the WTA Championships in Singapore will be the best ever for them,\" said Mr Yeo. \"That is important from our perspective because we see this event as burnishing our credentials as the events capital of Asia. It's got to be done well, and it's got to be done in a way which Singapore excels in.\"\n\nWhile the final line-up of players coming to Singapore will not be confirmed until much closer to October, the current top eight women's singles players include Australian Open champion Li Na of China, Serena Williams of the United States and Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska.\n\nAt last year's tournament in Istanbul, Williams defeated Li Na in three sets to win her career-high 11th title of 2013 and fourth WTA crown.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The measures helped boost passenger numbers 6 per cent to 18.3 million in the third quarter, even as it posted a 35.2 million euro (S$60.6 million) loss from the competition over fares.\n\n\"The weakness has eased,\" chief financial officer Howard Millar said yesterday in an interview. \"The market is still soft, but the rate of decline has stopped and bottoming out or stable would be our view at the moment.\"\n\nThe stock has gained 17 per cent in the last 12 months, valuing the airline at 9.07 billion euros.\n\nChief executive Michael O'Leary reiterated in a statement that full-year profit through March 31 will be about 510 million euros.\n\nWhile yields, a measure of pricing, will still drop about 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, that's less than the 10 per cent previously forecast, the company said.\n\nRyanair and discount rival EasyJet plc are looking to expand their networks as former flag carriers undertake the latest revamps of their short-haul units. Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM Group have bolstered European offerings and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA has bought new planes for its low-cost Spanish unit Vueling.\n\nThe Irish carrier opened four Italian bases in December and plans to station planes in Brussels, Lisbon, and Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece. The new locations will help boost the customer total to 110 million from just over 80 million over the next five years, it said in a statement.\n\n\"Substantial\" growth will come from primary airports, according to the release, marking a shift away from its focus on secondary bases, where the travel market tends to be more discretionary and fares generally lower.\n\nRyanair offered an introductory fare of 14.99 euros on about 400 routes in October and November, adding to 600 links already on sale. Grounding jets from November through March will remove 750,000 seats from the market, Mr O'Leary has said.\n\nThe carrier plans to triple its marketing spend this year to about 35 million euros and is moving to fully-allocated seating this month in a push to draw business passengers and customers looking for higher service levels.\n\nEarly trials to ensure a smooth roll-out of designated berths should protect the carrier's 25-minute turnaround time, Mr Millar said.\n\n\"We have the weakest month in terms of passenger volumes, which is February, to iron out the teething problems, so our view is we should be in a pretty good situation,\" he said. \"We need reserved and allocated seating take-up to be positive because we have reduced other charges.\"\n\nOther refinements to the airline's ultra-low-cost model include a de-cluttered website, reduced baggage fees and specialised products targeting corporate customers and groups.\n\nThe carrier's online booking process has been streamlined to five \"clicks\" from 17 and Ryanair will begin issuing mobile boarding passes in April.\n\nThe carrier extended its fiscal-year 2015 fuel hedge to 90 per cent at US$960 per tonne on the back of a weaker US dollar and lower oil prices. Fuel and currency hedging will deliver cost savings of about 80 million euros in 2015, Ryanair said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The baht fell every day last week, declining 0.6 per cent. The SET Index of shares climbed 1.5 per cent - the biggest gain since Jan 16 - to 1,292.81, following last week's 3.1 per cent drop.\n\nPrime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said she was pleased with the situation because there was no violence, after polls closed at 3pm local time on Sunday. She deployed 10,000 police in Bangkok, having declared a state of emergency to avoid a repeat of the disturbances that obstructed advance voting in the south and most of the capital on Jan 26. Global funds have pulled a net US$4.7 billion from the nation's bonds and stocks since the protests began last Oct 31, official data shows.\n\n\"There was some concern surrounding the election but it ended without any chaos, leading to some buybacks of the baht,\" said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp in Bangkok. \"But a rebound in the baht may be limited as there's no change in the situation with political unrest continuing.\"\n\nThe country's third general election since a 2006 coup will do little to quell street protests by groups demanding Ms Yingluck's resignation and the installation of an appointed government. The results of the poll, which the main opposition Democrat Party boycotted, won't be announced until by-elections are held in dozens of districts where protesters blocked candidates from registering.\n\nTen people have been killed and almost 600 injured since the protests began. Suthep Thaugsuban, a former Democrat powerbroker who has led a three- month campaign to oust Ms Yingluck, said the election will be annulled because his group blocked candidates from registering in some provinces and shut down polling stations during advance voting. Protesters have also occupied several major intersections in the city since Jan 13 in a bid to prevent Ms Yingluck's government from functioning.\n\n\"Thai equities got a boost from a more peaceful election than people had expected,\" said Teerada Charnyingyong, an investment strategist at Phillip Securities (Thailand) Pcl in Bangkok. \"Still, the gains will be limited as the election won't result in the formation of new government in the next few months. The delay will have a significant impact on the economy and corporate earnings.\"\n\nAbhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the main opposition Democrat Party, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that he didn't vote in Sunday's elections because he thinks the polls were unconstitutional. Ms Yingluck's ruling party betrayed the trust of the Thai people by attempting to pass a bill that would have given amnesty to her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, he said.\n\nThe Democrat Party plans to file a petition to the Constitutional Court today, asking it to annul the general election on grounds that it was unconstitutional, Mr Abhisit told reporters.\n\nThe Finance Ministry lowered its 2014 growth forecast for the second time in a month on Jan 16 to 3.1 per cent from a December prediction of 4 per cent.\n\nOne-month implied volatility in the baht, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.38 per cent.\n\nThe yield on the 3.125 per cent government bonds due December 2015 declined one basis point to 2.44 per cent. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

This comprised cash earnings, not valuation gains, and almost matched the combined earnings of CapitaLand and City Developments, the two largest domestic developers, over that quarter.\n\nWhat caused Oxley's earnings spike? Under International Financial Reporting Standard 115, its 728-unit industrial project, Oxley BizHub, had its profits booked wholly upon attaining TOP (temporary occupation permit) over the quarter. This is known as the Completion of Contract (COC) recognition method and is required for commercial and overseas projects, unlike the progressive profit recognition (POC method) usually seen for domestic residential projects.\n\nWe note that the full visibility of COC profits can be price catalysts for small-mid cap companies, particularly if they are not well-covered; Oxley's share price subsequently appreciated as much as 40 per cent after its results announcement.\n\nWe highlight two companies likely to see similar earnings boosts ahead. First, Roxy-Pacific is expected to see a boost from Wis@Changi attaining TOP in its upcoming Q413 earnings. In addition, Lian Beng is also likely to have their next quarterly Q3FY14 earnings bumped up by its 55-per cent stake in M-Space achieving TOP. Both Roxy and Lian Beng are rated \"buy\" with fair value estimates of S$0.65 and S$0.58, respectively.\n\nGenting Singapore\n\nFeb 3 close: S$1.34\n\nMAYBANK KIM ENG, Feb 3\n\nMBS reported a 14 per cent y-o-y drop in Q413 Ebitda to US$258.8 million due to a 17 per cent y-o-y contraction (in USD terms) of Q4 VIP volume that was exacerbated by a low VIP hold rate of 1.92 per cent.\n\nQ413 mass market GGR (table and slot) did not help much either, posting just 3 per cent y-o-y growth (in USD terms). The only silver lining is that the Japanese casino liberalisation process may be fast-tracked by a year.\n\nAssuming Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) commands a 47-48 per cent VIP volume share, we can expect Genting Singapore (GENS) to also report Q413 VIP volume contraction of about 17 per cent y-o-y to about S$16 billion.\n\nThis would bring RWS' 2013 VIP volume to S$74.5 billion, in line with our forecast of S$75.3 billion.\n\nFor mass market GGR, if RWS retained its Q313 market share of 44 per cent in Q413, we estimate its Q413 mass market GGR would have eased by 5 per cent y-o-y. This would bring its 2013 mass market GGR to S$1.7 billion, or a tad below our forecast of S$1.8 billion.\n\nGENS will release its Q413 results on Feb 20. While likely to be within expectations, we expect it will report a sequentially higher Q413 Ebitda of about S$350 million and net profit of S$200 million as we do not think its VIP hold rate will be as poor as MBS'. We leave our estimates unchanged for now.\n\nNonetheless, we believe the consensus is too bullish on GENS' earnings outlook and it is still premature to assign any \"Japanese casino\" option value to its share price as request for proposals are only likely to be issued in 2015, at the earliest. Maintain TP of S$1.31, based on 10x FY14E Enterprise value/Ebitda.\n\nSELL\n\nCache Logistics Trust\n\nFeb 3 close: S$1.085\n\nUOB KAY HIAN, Feb 3\n\nWE recently hosted Cache Logistics Trust's (Cache) management to a post-results feedback session with investors.\n\nPositive reversions are likely for the master-leases coming due in 2015 (34 per cent of portfolio), based on current market rents.\n\nManagement was more optimistic on the prospects for higher reversions for properties in the eastern region of Singapore, where slower growth in new supply will ensure that occupancies remain high.\n\nWe estimate that the IPO portfolio could see double-digit rental reversions of 10-12 per cent in 2015, providing an organic growth catalyst, while annual rents under the master-leases have been growing at 1.5-2.0 per cent per annum over the four years from listing, with market rents for logistic facilities having risen 22 per cent since Q210.\n\nWhile we anticipate that the bulk of the master-leases will be renewed in the next one to two years, management is preparing for the prospect that some master-leases may not be renewed and that Cache will assume the underlying management of the properties. To this end, management continues to engage with sub-tenants to ensure that underlying occupancies remain robust.\n\nAsset divestments from the sponsor are still the preferred avenue for inorganic growth, but will be dependent on the sponsor CWT's timeline and funding needs. Sale-and-leaseback opportunities from the sponsor remain the favoured approach to further acquire master-leased properties at reasonable cap rates.\n\nManagement continues to explore third-party acquisition opportunities, although this has become more difficult in Singapore due to JTC policies requiring upfront payment of land premiums.\n\nManagement has acknowledged that sale-and-leaseback of master-leased properties will also become increasingly uncommon and that acquisitions of multi-tenanted facilities will be more typical moving forward. Overseas acquisitions in Malaysia and China remain a possibility, especially in or near the fringes of key tier-one cities.\n\nBUY\n\nCompiled by ANDREA SOH\n\nGlossary\n\nEbit - earnings before interest and tax\n\nEbitda - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation\n\nEPS - earnings per share\n\nFY - fiscal/financial year\n\nH1, H2 - first or second half\n\nNAV - net asset value\n\n9M - nine months\n\nP/B - price/book value (ratio)\n\nPE - price/earnings (ratio)\n\nQ1, Q2, Q3 - first, second, or third quarter\n\nq-o-q - quarter-on-quarter\n\nRNAV - revised net asset value\n\nROE - return on equity\n\nTP - target price\n\ny-o-y - year-on-year\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

Long wagers rose 5.5 per cent to the highest since September, and short bets dropped 16 per cent. Net-bullish copper holdings tumbled 62 per cent as shorts gained by the most in 11 weeks.\n\nAbout US$1.9 trillion was erased from the value of global equities last month as China's economy slowed and the Federal Reserve further cut stimulus on Jan 29.\n\nSouth Africa's central bank increased interest rates, Turkey more than doubled them and Argentina's peso dropped 19 per cent against the US dollar in January, more than any other currency tracked by Bloomberg. The tumult drove gold to its first monthly gain since August and copper to the worst start to a year since 2010.\n\n\"China rules the copper market, and it's obvious that there are no reasons for this market to move higher as supply is ample, and demand is sluggish,\" said Peter Jankovskis, who helps oversee US$3.5 billion as co-chief investment officer of Lisle, Illinois-based OakBrook Investments.\n\n\"Gold, on the other hand, is seeing some buying given the turmoil in many countries, but what remains to be seen is if the rally can sustain in the face of tapering.\"\n\nGold futures gained 3.1 per cent last month to US$1,239.80 an ounce, while copper dropped 5.9 per cent on the Comex in New York. The Standard & Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities fell 1.6 per cent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities declined 4.1 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, rose 1.2 per cent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index climbed 1.8 per cent.\n\nNet wagers across 18 US-traded commodities rose 6.5 per cent to 782,818 contracts last week, the highest since October, the CFTC data showed.\n\nThe US Mint sold 91,500 ounces of gold coins last month, the most since April, joining counterparts from Australia to Europe in reporting higher demand. Prices rebounded more than 5 per cent since reaching a 34-month low in June as physical buying rose. Bullion shipments to China from Hong Kong in 2013 more than doubled to a record 1,108.8 tonnes from a year earlier, according to customs data. Gold for April delivery gained 0.5 per cent yesterday to US$1,246 an ounce on the Comex in New York.\n\nCopper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange jumped 18 per cent last month, the first increase since October. Global production will outstrip use by 167,000 tonnes this year, following a deficit of 137,000 tonnes in 2013, Barclays plc estimates. The London Metal Exchange Index of the six main metals traded on the bourse fell 3.7 per cent last month, the worst start to a year since 2010.\n\nThe economy in China, the world's biggest consumer of everything from copper to cotton to pork, will expand 7.4 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey showed.\n\nRobust growth in the US will help stem declines for industrial metals, and the rally in gold will be short-lived, according to James Paulsen, the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.\n\nUS household purchases, which account for about 70 per cent of the economy, climbed more than expected in December, Commerce Department figures showed on Jan 31. The Fed last week cut its monthly bond purchases to US$65 billion from US$75 billion, a second straight US$10 billion cut. Goldman Sachs Group Inc is forecasting more declines for gold after it fell 28 per cent last year. Prices will reach US$1,050 in the next 12 months, the bank said in a Jan 12 report.\n\nBullion holdings through exchange-traded products fell 33 per cent in the past year, erasing about US$71 billion from the value of the funds.\n\n\"What we are seeing is broadening of economic growth, and China is not contracting - the growth rate has slowed, but it's still growing,\" Mr Paulsen said. \"Industrial metals may slowly see an upturn once the turmoil in emerging markets calms. At that point, there will not be much upside for gold.\"\n\nBanks from Goldman to Citigroup said that raw materials are heading for more losses in 2014 as rising supplies and slowing demand compound slumps that led to bear markets last year in gold, copper and corn. The super cycle that led commodities to almost quadruple since 2001 is reversing, with prices set to drop 3 per cent in 12 months, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's head of commodities research, said in the Jan 12 report. The asset class will be a \"wallflower\" compared with equities, Citigroup said in a Jan 6 note.\n\n\"The time when people were buying anything has moved, and now people are taking a view on individual commodities,\" said Frances Hudson, a strategist at Standard Life in Edinburgh.\n\n\"The super cycle has ended. The story for copper is neutral. The days of seeing high numbers from China may be ending. People saw gold was oversold last year, and money was moving to equities. There has been some reshuffle, but I don't think there has been a reversal of fortune for gold.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

In the spirit of optimism, we believe global recovery is on track, with economic growth in Asia likely to gain momentum. If the year were a race, our top picks would include Asian countries such as Singapore, which has sound economic fundamentals and a stable government, which we hope will enter the year on a gallop and aim for a strong finish.\n\nThe \"wood\" element is also said to help balance one's positive and negative characteristics. At ABN Amro, our wish is for our clients to continue maintaining balanced investment portfolios to increase diversification and resilience, so as to withstand any uncertainty that may occur in 2014.\n\nFor Singapore, we wish that everyone will not only be optimistic about the economy, but also to be more compassionate - just as we intend to continue keeping a lookout for the not so fortunate and to contribute to the sustainability of the community we do business in.\n\nDan Neary\n\nVice-President\n\nFacebook APAC\n\nIN 2014, reaching the relevant target audience at scale will no longer be restricted by traditional definitions of primetime. Primetime will be all the time, as time spent on digital networks, particularly on mobile, continues to rise. The year will see an increasing number of brands using mobile and digital tools such as location-based technology to reach out to customers at various touch points of the consumer journey, as well as to build rapport and brand identification. Social media will increasingly become mainstream as marketers continue to leverage digital platforms such as Facebook to engage people at scale and deliver core marketing outcomes. Businesses in Singapore will begin to better utilise targeting and measurement tools available to reach prospective customers on the digital and mobile landscape. These tools will level the playing field for businesses of all sizes and can reach the right people with more accuracy and efficiency than ever before.\n\nPrakash Mallya\n\nCountry Manager\n\nIntel Singapore and Malaysia\n\nTHE Year of the Horse is going to be exciting for Intel and our partners, whether it's bringing new devices to consumers or giving them a \"sneak peek\" into the next frontier of technology.\n\nLeveraging the talent and experience, we aim to address new emerging form factors that are multi-tasking powerhouses and are capable of interacting with consumers in new ways. Touch it, type on it, or talk to it, we want to be the ones to make these devices a reality.\n\nIn the burgeoning age of the Internet of Things, we will dive into the world of wearable devices where we will provide tech-savvy Singaporeans with more meaningful and valuable experiences that will change the way they live. Our goal is to provide consumers the ability to experience tomorrow today.\n\nJean-Michel Dumont\n\nChairman, Asia\n\nRuder Finn Asia\n\nAS we enter the Year of the Horse, the one word that would define the public relations industry is \"nimble\". This will be an asset public relations professionals will need to have. We need to recognise that communications is a multi-stakeholder process - the strategies and tactics we develop and implement must take this dynamic into consideration. More important, it is also about anticipating and listening to our audiences and responding effectively. Asia is at a crossroads economically and socially, and hence the need for engagement and effective communication is greater than ever.\n\nAdam Judd\n\nVice-President, Asia Pacific\n\nBrocade\n\nThe Horse is an auspicious animal in the Chinese zodiac which symbolises good luck, vitality and power. We are hopeful the Year of the Horse will help accelerate economic recovery globally and bring upon new opportunities and financial growth. In our industry, we expect new technologies such as software-defined networking and network functions virtualisation to gain momentum which will enable service providers to launch cloud services and drive new revenue streams. Brocade has always been at the forefront of industry trends. We are poised to continue building on our strengths and leadership position by tapping unprecedented opportunities that exist today and will reshape the networking industry tomorrow. We will continue to leverage our strong innovation heritage and excellent customer focus for growth this year. Let's not forget that the Horse can be wild and temperamental at times. Vigilance and agility are, therefore, key to success and surmounting challenges whenever the going gets tough.\n\nMark Billington FCA\n\nRegional Director - South East Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nASEAN'S continuing growth and sound finances bode well for the accountancy sector in Singapore. The reforms to the professional qualification will be embedded this year, making it another key year for the profession as a whole. The challenge for the accountancy profession is always to attract and retain the best and the brightest talent, and on my wishlist for the New Year would be ensuring that access to the profession is further broadened so that anyone with the aptitude and ability to become a chartered accountant has the opportunity to enter the profession. This may mean increasing efforts in recruiting through non-traditional routes, or raising awareness of the profession among groups that might not traditionally have considered accountancy. It may also mean providing mentors and role models that inspire younger professionals to become business and finance leaders, and considering how we work so that the profession is seen as a \"role for life\". In the long term, it is in everyone's interests to recruit from the widest possible talent pool and this will ensure the profession remains relevant and dynamic going forward.\n\nLim Tit Meng\n\nChief Executive\n\nScience Centre Singapore\n\nTHERE is a new energy in our pre-school education arena with many recent initiatives from both the public and private sectors. With good infrastructure, quality pre-school systems and early childhood education programmes, our young parents will have a conducive and nurturing environment to bring up their young ones. These developments may also encourage married couples to consider starting a family earlier or to have more children. Hopefully we will see a reverse trend in our declining birth rate. Science Centre Singapore will open a new Children Science Centre specially designed for age 8 and below in the middle of 2014. Through purposeful play, it will be an exciting place where children get to \"imagine, experience, discover and dream\". We aspire to become a significant part of the early childhood education ecosystem, building upon our 36 years of experience in intriguing the minds of millions through science, technology and creativity.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nWHILE Singapore continues to focus on tackling economic challenges and restructuring, we must not lose sight of the needy, poor, marginalised, disadvantaged, sick and incarcerated. Singapore has some way to go tobecoming a giving nation. To arrive there, it will require the active participation of the whole of the public, private and people sectors. So far, it is fair to say that the private sector has been leading the way. The call to give has often been to the private sector. It is timely to extend the call to the public sector to play a bigger role. It is vital that the public sector, represented by our civil servants in their private capacities, contribute more to giving. More civil servants, especially those in the higher echelons, can now afford to give, as compared with their peers in the past. Fund raisers should, therefore, not be wary of approaching civil servants to offer them the opportunity to give, be it to their alma maters, VWOs, charitable organisations or for a laudable cause. I wish the Year of the Horse will see this significant shift in our giving ecosystem, that more of our civil servants will ride together with their private sector counterparts and gallop to a new high in giving. It can be only for the good of Singapore, the community and businesses but more importantly for those who need the most help.\n\nMarc Mathenz\n\nSenior Vice-President and Head of Asia Pacific\n\nFirst Data\n\n2014 promises to be an exciting year for the payments industry. We are witnessing rapid digitisation of payments, as we continue a global shift away from paper to electronic. This is the greatest period of innovation we've seen, with new payment methods, business models, and even currencies reported by the media on a daily basis. In the New Year, we hope to see e-commerce in Singapore reach new levels, spurring wider adoption of alternative payment methods in addition to cash and credit and debit cards. We believe Singapore has the potential to develop breakthrough innovations that reduce consumer reliance on cash, and export those innovations to other countries in Asia. As a leading global payments solutions provider, First Data sees itself playing a pivotal role in driving these innovative products and powering transactions. We aim to expand further into South-east Asia, leveraging on Singapore's strategic position as a financial services hub.\n\nDaniel Lim\n\nDirector\n\nSoo Kee Group\n\nTHE Year of the Horse is believed to be an auspicious one for the Chinese and at SK Jewellery our outlook is equally bullish. Gold is traditionally seen as a symbol of wealth, prosperity and blessing. Recent adjustments in the gold price means that 999 Pure Gold items have become more accessible to all. SK Jewellery expects to see more people looking to our 999 Pure Gold collections as special gifts in 2014. Not only for the solid value that 999 Pure Gold represents, but also because giving gold signifies shared feelings of optimism for the future. On behalf of the Soo Kee Group, I would like to wish one and all a very happy and prosperous Chinese New Year, and I hope for a stronger and more stellar performance for the Singapore gold and diamond industry this year.\n\nAlex Caro\n\nChief Technology Officer and\n\nVice-President of Services - Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nAkamai Technologies\n\nAKAMAI'S mission is to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure. The Year of the Horse indeed portends fleet growth for our customers across a range of industries. From online video broadcasts of live events, to expected record growth in eCommerce, to even more enterprise software moving to the cloud, the Internet will come one step closer to being the most pervasive, most adaptable communication medium in history.\n\nBut with great growth comes great risks. We expect the Year of the Horse to also bring a record-breaking number of cyber attacks. Cyber attacks drain productivity and confidence from the economy. As it relates to the Chinese zodiac, the Horse is characterised by its acute senses. Businesses should be alert and vigilant to cyber threats and our wish this year is for greater collaboration between business and government to address these important threats proactively.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nBIG Data will get bigger as the membership and engagement on social media platforms such as LinkedIn continue its northward trend. LinkedIn's professional member base in Singapore grew more than 30 per cent in 2013 to well over one million, for example. This rise in digital consumption is either a competitive advantage or a threat for companies. To get ahead of their peers, more companies will look to harnessing insights from big data to inform key initiatives such as marketing, so that they can build even more rewarding relationships with their audiences. As the talent crunch intensifies, we should also see more companies leveraging data analytics to make more effective hiring decisions, up from about a quarter of companies we surveyed globally in 2013.\n\nAs we go about fulfilling our vision of creating economic opportunities for all professionals, we also hope to contribute to Singapore's continued prosperity in the Year of the Horse.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express (Singapore)\n\nIN the Year of the Horse, the logistics industry will remain vibrant with key sectors such as marine, aerospace, oil & gas and life sciences well positioned to achieve record growth. 2014 is the year for Singapore to sharpen its competitive edge to strengthen further its strategic regional hub position for trade and supply chain.\n\nOne of DHL's key thrusts will be to continue providing great services to our customers to ensure seamless delivery and forge strong partnerships. The implementation of efficient logistics technology and solutions will enable our customers' growth and success through enhanced productivity. SMEs in Singapore remain our core focus and DHL will continue to play a strategic role in helping local firms expand in the region and globally.\n\nLooking forward, DHL Express Singapore will continue enhancing its position as a regional hub to tap the new opportunities emerging in the South-east Asian region, as we strive to stay ahead of the pack and be the best of breed in the logistics industry.\n\nNg Eng Kiong\n\nPresident\n\nSingapore Green Building Council\n\nTHE construction industry has been doing well in the past couple of years and is expected to remain healthy this year. With the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) regulating a minimum standard of environmental performance in buildings since 2008, most building professionals are now familiar with green building design concepts. The challenge now is to take the greening process through the entire building supply chain, so that all materials, fixtures and fittings that go into a building are green too. SGBC provides a green building certification framework to guide companies on that. My wish is for more Singaporeans, including the man in the street, to understand the impact that buildings can cause to the environment and the difference that consumers can make. By demanding more environmentally friendly buildings and building products, we can help conserve natural resources, use energy and water more efficiently, and minimise harm to the environment. Green buildings deliver improved health and productivity of occupants too, so that, in itself, is a good enough reason.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nTHE virtues ascribed to the zodiac Horse encompasses reliability, strength and speed. These attributes also describe the character of NTUC FairPrice and the values we embrace - performing with determination and diligence to deliver our brand promise to customers. For 2014, the commitment to our social mission of moderating the cost of living for our customers and offering quality products at best value will continue to form the core of our strategic focus. The two key challenges of labour shortage and rising cost of business will have its full impact on us. Hence it is an imperative that we further strengthen our business by embracing a spirit of innovation, increasing productivity and enhancing our service initiatives while placing our customers' interest at heart. These will not be easy but try we must so that we can do well and continue to do more good. The support of our various business partners is also an integral and key success factor for FairPrice and we will continue to stand by them - especially our local SME suppliers - and complement their efforts in growing their businesses. Above all, I wish for our country, businesses and individuals alike, good health, fulfilling times and prosperity in the Year of the Horse and a dose of good luck too.\n\nDennis Rose\n\nSenior Vice-President for APAC and Japan\n\nBrightcove\n\nTHE Year of the Horse looks set to be an exciting year with online video developments influencing the digital industry, and businesses must embrace the changing trends to reap the benefits. As the industry moves towards greater live-streaming of high-quality video content via the Web, apps and social channels, businesses are presented with the exciting possibilities of brand-produced live content designed to coincide with major events such as the World Cup and Winter Olympics.\n\nThere will be more opportunities for businesses to better target, revise and streamline their advertising creative and dollar spending, especially as the industry transitions from linear broadcasting to digital distribution. With cloud-based advertising, they can enjoy superior data acquisition from digital ads and achieve far more than through traditional broadcast advertising.\n\nLastly, as media companies enhance online programming with new approaches to provide continuous playback or lean-back experiences, video on-demand will increasingly mimic the traditional TV viewing experience, providing brands with opportunities to make online advertising more frequent, but with less invasive touch points.\n\nVenkatraman Sheshashayee\n\nChief Executive Officer/Executive Director\n\nJaya Holdings Ltd\n\nTHE Jaya Group of Companies operates in the offshore oilfield services business. We believe that the Year of the Horse will be good for this domain and for our group. We expect the markets to be increasingly active, leading to higher capacity utilisation and enhanced revenues. We hope to, through improved productivity and efficiency, reduce costs and downtime. I believe that our group will see measurable progress towards our long-term goals and, in the process, achieve and surpass our near-term objectives. I hope that this will energise our people further, as they enjoy the fruits of their planning and actions.I believe Singapore will accelerate on its path to re-inventing itself. I wish all Singaporeans the knowledge of new avenues, exciting opportunities, achievable objectives and, most important, the realisation that, together, we can be whatever we choose to be.\n\nAmmar Hindi\n\nManaging Director for Asia Pacific\n\nSourcefire, now a part of Cisco\n\nAS we ring in 2014, we expect Singapore businesses to continue riding on the momentum from the previous year to generate substantial technological advances and financial growth. However, as organisations increasingly look to the cloud and rely on new technologies to enhance productivity, save cost and speed deployment, the increase in cyber attacks on these innovations is inevitable.\n\nThe reality is that cybercriminals are professionals and hacking today is an industrial process that follows the money trail. As a result, security has also rapidly emerged as a boardroom topic. There is no doubt that the battle between IT security and cybercriminals will continue in 2014 and beyond - it is no longer a question of whether you will be attacked, but when.\n\nWhile there is no silver bullet approach to IT security, Singapore organisations can plan their corporate networks assuming they will be compromised at some point. This would ensure that they would be well-equipped to contain and repair any damage to their brand and reputation when the attack hits. Given the new levels of sophisticated attacks, it is clear that the foundation of any security solution requires a threat-centric approach that addresses the full attack continuum - before, during and after an attack.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nMANY companies across industries are looking to improve the way they leverage IT in support of wider business strategies and operational goals. Recent reports are also expecting expansion in products, services and reach for companies in the finance, commercial and technology sectors. In both cases, innovation will be a main part of discussions as these organisations seek support to maximise the use of current technological assets and provision for future needs. It is certainly going to be a busy year for the technology industry, as reflected in the current strong demand for IT professionals.\n\nThe Year of the Wooden Horse represents a year of speedy success. Fujitsu Singapore will continue to work closely with its customers to help them achieve success through continuous innovation and new technology breakthroughs. As Singapore's positive outlook and competitiveness continue into 2014, I believe it is well placed to achieve further success as a nation. My wish would be for the country to continue its focus on developing talent in IT, in support of the IT needs of growing companies.\n\nDavid Topolewski\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nQooco\n\nDIGITAL will be the game changer in education for Singapore and the region. 2014 is the year where the big move from traditional learning to mobile learning methods will take place. Organisations are increasingly replacing expensive classroom learning that yields mediocre results with innovative solutions that deliver measurable results at a fraction of the cost. Mobile learning addresses the need for change on the back of the growing smartphone penetration rates in the region. This new way forward fuses seamlessly into the modern lifestyles of our digitalised population and enables wider access to education. Because learning can take place anytime, anywhere, it eliminates limitations to schedules and physical attendance. For mobile to truly revolutionise the education system, Asia's mobile infrastructure will require improvement on the whole, to eradicate all barriers to m-learning.\n\nTony Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nAedas Singapore\n\nASIA is a diverse region with each market pursuing different trajectories, from developing infrastructure to shaping large-scale commercial projects. The improved market sentiment heralding the Year of the Horse will drive rapid growth for the region which, in turn, offers many opportunities for the architectural design and construction industry.\n\nAedas has been active in Asia and we are determined to continue creating holistic designs that inject unique architectural identities to the communities not just in Singapore, but across Asia as well.\n\nSarah Montgomery\n\nDirector of Client Solutions, Asia Pacific\n\nOpower\n\nAT Opower we help utility customers save energy. Several interesting developments in the energy sector are expected to gain momentum in 2014. One of these is the widespread introduction of energy-efficiency policies. It is forecast that, by 2035, Asia will account for more than half of annual global energy consumed. Increasingly, countries like Singapore, Japan, China and many developing nations are finding efficiency to be one of the cheapest and cleanest energy sources at their disposal; they will become more aggressive with efficiency policies. The widespread deployment of smart meters will also see the use of dynamic pricing picking up steam to cut demand during peak periods. Utilities are not the only industry looking at price signals to change behaviour. A good example is LTA's one-year trial to provide free travel on the MRT for commuters who end their journey before 7.45 am on weekdays. Our wish is for everyone - from government to utility companies to individuals - to commit to taking greater control of their energy consumption to meet future energy demand and protect the environment.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB (Asean)\n\nFOR T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB, the Year of the Horse is a year of optimism and ambition. There is consensus that global economic growth will improve in 2014. Therefore, Asean economies will most likely see growth as well. Our business is about testing, auditing, certification and inspection. So, naturally, our business is closely tied to the health and wealth of our region. We are optimistic our business will perform better in 2014. This year we wish most to realise our vision of becoming \"One Asean\". This means we will strive to bring our people and resources across Asean onto one single, unified platform. South-east Asia is entering a new era and Asean companies such as ourselves are poised to take our place as regional champions. We also wish to reduce the distance between us and the public by communicating with them more directly. We, therefore, commit to become more proactive in giving value-add information on safety, quality standards and offering thought leadership on market issues. We truly believe a more informed public makes a more knowledgeable public, who will, in turn, demand higher levels of quality, safety and raise overall industry benchmarks.\n\nMartin Hayes\n\nPresident\n\nBosch South-east Asia\n\nAS the regional headquarters for South-east Asia, Bosch Singapore coordinates a dynamic and diverse market from here. Therefore, speed and agility are of the essence to not only maintain the company's market leadership in the fields that it operates in, but to also conquer new frontiers. Singapore has been dubbed one of the world's friendliest economies for entrepreneurs. My hope is for Singapore to breed more driven, entrepreneurial talent who will seize the flourishing opportunities in our region, and pioneer new technologies that set the benchmark for the rest of the world to follow. The spirit of innovation has been the backbone of Bosch's success for more than 125 years. Even as a large multinational corporation, I wish for Bosch to learn from Singapore's achievement in implementing a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem, and for us to continue building an entrepreneurial culture at all levels, across all functions that fosters innovation and risk-taking.\n\nJulien Le Noble\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nCME Group\n\nAS we ride into the Year of the Horse, the futures and options markets are already off to a galloping start. CME Group's volumes across interest rates, equity indices, FX, energy, agricultural commodities and metals products averaged 10.9 million contracts daily in December 2013, up 13 per cent compared with the year-ago period. Our pace-setting Asia business, which has seen some 20 per cent growth in the past year, will continue to be a key driver of growth, as we harness the opportunities here in Asia, tapping the developments led by Greater China and East Asia.\n\nThe derivatives markets continue to evolve as regulatory mandates unfold globally. Take, for example OTC derivatives trade reporting in Singapore, which kicks in on April 1. As we move into the final furlong, this initiative will undoubtedly strengthen regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives market when launched. Regulators and industry participants have engaged and consulted one another regularly to agree on deliverables and implementation timelines with an aim to complement the clearing mandate in the city state.\n\nAt CME Group, we are in constant dialogue with market constituents to work on safeguarding market integrity and customer protection, to ensure a transparent, liquid and fair marketplace where risks can be managed across our six asset class complexes, which will expand further with the upcoming launch of our London-based exchange CME Europe. On the OTC front, with our clearing and trade repository services fully aligned with the mandates implemented in the US last year, our clients can also now benefit from the flexibility of executing swaps side-by-side with listed futures through our swap execution facility. In addition, CME Clearing Europe - our London-based clearing house - aims to serve clients who need to have their OTC transactions cleared in a European regulatory environment and in the European time zone. Closer to home for our Asian clients, the Year of the Horse will see CME Group continue to focus on expanding into Asian products and services that help customers manage their risks with greater efficiency and accessibility as the demands of competition and regulation intensify in the Far East.\n\nNeal Armstrong\n\nCEO and Principal Officer\n\nStandard Life, Singapore\n\nFOR Standard Life and the life insurance industry, the Year of the Horse is expected to bring about an increased focus on the consumer. As this development evolves, spurred by incoming regulations, this will likely include the creation of more customised financial planning solutions and greater transparency from insurance providers and financial advisers which will bring about increased value for consumers.\n\nThe changing regulatory landscape will help expedite this process, navigating us towards a more robust financial advice process which benefits both industry and consumer, helping ensure that people fully understand what they are buying and that they are protected when they do so.\n\nWhile there will always be a place for face-to-face financial advice, and a need for quality financial advisers to deliver this service, we will also see a push towards online interaction with the Internet becoming ever more important as an unbiased and real-time source of information on products, insurance providers and their services.\n\nAng Swee Meng, Allen\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nWE expect the semiconductor industry to achieve tempered growth in 2014. The industry is reducing its dependence on wireless/communication handsets, consumer electronics and computing. More semiconductor applications are being developed for automotive, medical and devices for the Internet of Things. Our R&D efforts last year resulted in several new products and services. We hope to commercialise them in 2014 and contribute to productivity improvement for the industry. We will continue to push for greater automation to enhance our production capacity. However, despite all our efforts at R&D and automation, the labour shortage continues to hinder our progress. We hope that the government will calibrate its foreign labour policies and ease the inflow skilled foreign talents.\n\nWe wish Singapore will be a more compassionate society where people will embrace different cultures, religions, ethnic background and status.\n\nMark Micallef\n\nArea Vice-President, Asean\n\nCitrix Systems\n\nIN the Year of the Snake, the Asean IT industry saw the strong entry of technologies such as cloud and mobility platforms. As we usher in the Year of the Horse, the IT industry will continue to see significant business opportunities as enterprises continually look for more ways for technology to positively impact productivity and bottom lines, while ensuring greater worklife balance to attract a new generation of employees. According to IDC, the mobile worker population, workers who work away from their conventional workplace, will hit 1.3 billion globally by 2015, while Forrester reports that smartphone penetration in Asia Pacific is expected to see the largest compound growth. In addition, almost half of the organisations surveyed in Citrix's recent Mobility in Business Report considered mobility their top business priority. Hence, organisations striving towards increasing organisational productivity and efficiency have to think of enabling a Mobile Workspace, a workspace that basically allows employees to work anywhere, anytime, on any device.\n\nAs employees move from one device to another, they seek a platform that enables secure and rapid delivery of corporate applications, data and other services. Thus, creating a fully mobile workstyle for an organisation's employees should be a corporate mission. Mobile workstyles are enabled by mobile workspaces, and Citrix provides all the technology components for these workspaces - online collaboration, access and data security, app and desktop virtualisation, enterprise mobility management, networking, and cloud orchestration. This gives IT complete control with policies to ensure security and compliance, while offering users the ultimate freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere. Organisations that are quick to accommodate the growth in mobile workers will see better collaboration and communication among their employees, which eventually gives them the competitive edge in this fast-paced business environment today.\n\nSamir Neji\n\nManaging Director, Asia Pacific\n\nAnaplan\n\nANAPLAN had strong worldwide growth in 2013 and we are bullish about the opportunities that the Year of the Horse brings. In the world of business modelling and planning, Anaplan is a proven thoroughbred racing far ahead of the quarter horses in the industry.\n\nWe look forward to widespread acceptance of cloud as a business enabler, as organisations continue to debunk the myths around cloud and recognise its real competitive advantage. 2013had seen many organisations adopt cloud technologies to benefit from a more agile and affordable way of working. This year, we see cloud breaking down business silos, improving collaboration and enabling real-time data sharing for better business planning. We also expect to see more cooperation across different businesses in the form of crowdsourcing. By sharing technologies, models and best practices across various sectors and non-competitive companies, we'll be able to dramatically improve how content is created, enriched and delivered.\n\nAnaplan wishes to build on the great momentum that we have had since launching in Singapore and Asia in March 2013. I hope that more organisations benefit from Anaplan's intuitive, in-memory modelling and planning platform to make faster and more informed business decisions. Singapore has been a staunch supporter of innovation and we look forward to greater collaboration with the industry to promote cloud computing adoption in the market.\n\nEnjoy the festivities and wishing you an abundant Year of the Horse.\n\nCraig Tegel\n\nRegional President\n\nAdobe Japan and Asia Pacific\n\nFOR businesses to engage successfully with customers, the ability to execute at speed is absolutely critical. Customer expectations are changing, and in the Year of the Horse, these expectations will reach a point where real-time engagement will no longer be a delight. Rather, it is now a baseline response that customers expect. Failing to do so will only frustrate them.\n\nTo orchestrate this last millisecond response, I would urge all businesses in Singapore to take data and analytics very seriously - they are the reliable workhorses powering every customer engagement programme, the most critical elements a brand relies on to determine in real time whether these programmes are working and how to change them if they are not.\n\nIt is only when a brand is executing at the speed of a racehorse backed by the twin workhorses of data and analytics that it can truly have the confidence and the right information to focus on innovation to delight the customer.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nTHE accounting profession will be affected by the shifts in regional wealth and power, extreme economic uncertainty and political transitions. These forces of change are driving new societal values, needs and expectations. The world has also entered what some regard as an era of \"digital Darwinism\" where technology is evolving too fast for many individuals and organisations to adapt to the changes. A \"new normal\" is emerging: individual people, business, society and government are all becoming more dependent on digital technologies and these technologies are all becoming more dependent on the Internet and on each other. During the Year of the Horse, the profession will be grappling with the challenges that these forces will impose upon them.\n\nAccounting professionals must be at the forefront of this wave, keeping abreast of the challenges and opportunities created by new and emerging technologies. By utilising analytical and problem-solving skills to assess modern technology's potential influence, the accounting industry can provide businesses and organisations the necessary insights to help guide and develop both vision and direction, as well as to influence tactical and strategic business decisions.\n\nNatalie Shuman\n\nSenior Vice-President, General Manager - EMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nAS we enter the Year of the Horse, which is considered to be full of energy and prosperity, many businesses are feeling suitably positive. This sentiment is driven by a good start to 2014 and encouraging economic projections. With this in mind a number of companies are planning how to ride this potential growth and human capital will play a key part. Singapore continues to experience a tight labour market and this means employee retention and developing internal talent are important ways to grow a business. To stay competitive in the market companies are looking beyond traditional recruitment channels and are focusing on contingent workers, third-party labourers, freelancers and independent contractors. This leads to higher adoption of integrated talent management processes that we help build with our clients. While working together with many large global companies we also notice that they are seeking new workforce models that offer a broader view of talent supply and how it aligns with their business objectives.\n\nJason Dacaret\n\nManaging Director\n\nRGF Executive Search\n\nTHE business landscape continues to grow increasingly borderless and competitive, and companies are being pushed to create new value through innovation, improving efficiencies and by hiring globally minded talent. This is not easy in a highly competitive market, but executives and HR professionals are spending more of their time identifying talent capable of creating value and managing across borders.\n\nOrganisations have traditionally hired talent based on their employment history, experience and accomplishments. But today, these factors are not enough. Companies need people with a global mindset, capable of connecting with people different from themselves and bringing people and resources together, despite location, culture or other boundaries. They need to have strong interpersonal skills, cultural empathy and an appreciation of diversity.\n\nThey also need to have a rich network and strong connections across borders with the capability to truly engage these contacts for mutual benefit.\n\nThese factors are not easy to measure with standard interviewing techniques, and executive search consultants must add value to their clients by improving their assessment methods on how to measure these competencies and appropriately match these with their clients' business strategy and culture. Firms that can do this successfully will continue to thrive through their clients' success, and those that cannot, may be pushed aside as search firms too must create new value and improve efficiencies.\n\nErnest Kan\n\nPresident\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\nSINGAPORE'S accountancy sector's transformation into a leading global accountancy hub by 2020 has gained steady momentum since the release of the Committee to Develop the Accountancy Sector report in 2010. As the industry's key stakeholders continue to work closely with one another and forge stronger ties with leading professional accountancy bodies and international organisations such as the International Federation of Accountants, I am confident that Singapore's accountancy profession will gallop ahead like a strong stallion, making great strides in achieving its vision. One of ISCA's key 2014 initiatives that supports this goal is the recently launched Singapore Accountancy Awards.\n\nThe inaugural awards is a premier platform that seeks to recognise outstanding businesses and individuals in the accounting arena who excelled in their respective fields and contributed to the advancement of the industry. Through the awards, ISCA hopes to promote good practices and strengthen the profession's branding as Singapore evolves into a vibrant global accountancy hub.\n\nI wish for ISCA, the national accountancy body, to continue building and strengthening itself to become a globally recognised professional accountancy body with global membership, outlook and standing, and contribute to Singapore's vision as a leading global accountancy hub.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWE look forward to 2014 being a dynamic and interesting year, full of opportunities relating to employment and career options. Singapore's strong economic climate and competitive job market will mean great opportunities for job seekers and for companies who are continuously searching for the best talent. Demand for talent has been consistent and is set to grow as Singapore has established itself as a powerhouse in the region. Singapore's strong economic climate and competitive job market will mean great opportunities for job seekers and for companies who are continuously searching for the best talent. An important and on-going focus is in the area of talent attraction and how we continually look to identify jobseekers with the right calibre to meet our clients' hiring needs. We look forward to partner more companies who require human resource solutions and to continue to build strong ties with government, industry and clients.\n\nKelly Kuhn\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nCarlson Wagonlit Travel\n\nTHEY say the Year of the Horse brings good fortune, and global business travel analysts forecast a robust outlook for the industry in 2014. Business travel spending in Singapore is expected to increase by around 5 per cent, while meetings and events volumes in the region are expected to grow by 2-5 per cent. This year, we aim to continue exceeding the expectations of our employees, our clients and other stakeholders. With signs of economic recovery in the US and Europe, I hope that we will see Singapore's economy grow in leaps and bounds this year. Continued economic, financial and political stability will be critical in boosting business activity and bringing prosperity to the Lion City.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice-President\n\nSymantec, Asia South\n\nIN the Year of the Horse, the Internet of Things movement will gallop to the forefront of the online security and technology industries. With the number of Internet-enabled devices forecasted to reach 50 billion by 2020, the relative lack of comprehensive security on these devices could be exploited by cyber attackers in the near future. This potential threat means that businesses in Singapore may face an initial struggle to manage security across the Internet of Things. To navigate this growing complexity in the security threat landscape, Symantec looks forward to further collaboration with partners, and more private-public partnerships to support the National Cyber Security Masterplan 2018. We hope to continue nurturing the next generation of experts in the online security sector, and wish Singapore a safe and prosperous new year.\n\nKaren Reddington\n\nRegional Vice-President, South Pacific\n\nFedEx Express\n\nThe developments in free trade agreements (FTAs) in the region will have a significant influence on growth in cross border trade in the Year of the Horse. Ongoing developments in the formation of trade partnerships such as the Asean Economic Community (AEC) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will encourage greater integration and impact the flow of goods and services across the region and Singapore when they are ratified. Apart from trade developments, key events and policies shaping the environment for small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) - one of the most important growth segments in the region - will also affect the industry's outlook for the year, as they generate 30 per cent of exports in the region. For the Year of the horse, I wish for greater access to regional and global markets that will benefit both multi-national corporations and the local SMEs, via FTAs and other regulations that break down trade barriers.\n\nJessica Tan\n\nManaging Director\n\nMicrosoft Singapore\n\nAS we usher in the Year of the Horse, the IT industry is cautiously optimistic for a vibrant year ahead. Cloud, enterprise social, mobility and Big Data will continue to have a positive impact on organisations, consumers and, in turn, the Singapore economy. We believe Singapore enterprises will stay steadfast and strong in creating value through IT and, at Microsoft, we remain committed to innovating and helping our customers do more in every part of their lives. We wish the Year of the Horse will bring more prosperity and growth for Singapore, our customers and partners. Beyond this, we are mindful of doing more to build a better, inclusive Singapore, especially for youths, seniors and the underserved. We will continue to drive initiatives to help close the digital and inter-generational divide. By working closely with education institutions and NGO partners, helping them effectively harness technology, we hope to ensure that young people, the elderly and those with disabilities are equipped with the right skills that will enhance their employability and future success.\n\nRick Theiler\n\nVice-President Asia-Pacific\n\nCommVault\n\nAS we enter into the Chinese New Year, research CommVault completed with IDC indicates that 10 per cent of Singapore enterprises will experience data growth greater than 60 per cent over the next 12 months. This is double the APAC average and illustrates the increase in size, complexity and availability of business intelligence that will need to be managed in Singapore compared to other parts of the region. It is very appropriate then that corporate data management processes, much like a horse, will not only be expected to carry an exponentially increasing burden of legislatory compliance but also lead the charge to increase profitability and deliver competitive advantage in 2014. Our research also indicates that Singapore firms are significantly more aware of the improvement in customer responsiveness that is possible, and the need to enforce information access policies, through effective data management strategies, than in other parts of APAC.\n\nTherefore this year, more than ever, we expect Singapore's forward-thinking enterprises to re-evaluate the efficiency of legacy approaches to data management infrastructure, in favour of a dedicated data management platform that addresses scalability, security and accessibility challenges, thus minimising the long-term cost of managing corporate data for a more prosperous Year of the Horse.\n\nDr John Keung\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nBuilding and Construction Authority\n\n2014 will be a swift and strong year for the built environment sector. Contracts for the built environment sector could reach between $31 billion and $38 billion this year, driven by strong infrastructure demand. It is thus an opportune time for the built environment sector to take advantage of the sturdy growth and restructure itself to be more productive and technologically advanced. There's still scope for players in the construction value chain to play a bigger part in the productivity movement, so we'd like to see them take greater rein in driving productivity improvements within their firms, especially among the developers.\n\nThere is also a need to train a sustained pipeline of skilled manpower to support the sector. BCA has been partnering the industry on a suite of scholarship, sponsorship and apprenticeship programmes to build up a strong talent pool at professional, technical and supervisory levels. Having these competent and skilled personnel in place will help steer technological advancement and productivity improvements in the built environment sector, a key sector of Singapore's economy. I wish for BCA to continue leading the sector like a decisive steed with clear aspiration and goals. For Singapore and the built environment sector, I wish the Year of the Horse will bring prosperity and success in our productivity journey.\n\nDoina Palici-Chehab\n\nCEO\n\nAXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nHOPEFULLY the Year of the Horse will be a prosperous and lucky one for everybody. As an industry, insurance is intimately linked with the protection of the lives and goods of clients and is meant to bring them peace of mind. My wish for the Year of the Horse is to create a community with our clients, to serve them well when they have a claim, to be a companion as much as horse and man have been throughout the millenniums. For our organisation, we wish for the good fortune of achieving our goals with our fully motivated employees, in an alert spirit and keeping in mind that our ultimate goal is the happiness of our clients.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nMaachu\n\nGENERALLY, it will be a tight labour market for most industries, especially the service sector. It is therefore important for business owners to get the right person for the job and the organisation, especially at the management level. At Maachu, we develop a technology to match the skills sets and experience of applicants to specified jobs. For employers, the Maachu platform brings a level of standardisation to the hiring process that allows for easier comparison of candidates. Maachu reduces the cost of hiring and significantly shortens the recruitment cycle. New hires can then contribute sooner to their new employers.\n\nBy successfully tackling the challenge of the unstructured nature of resumes and combining Maachu's innovation with a purpose built technology platform, I hope this will streamline the candidate sourcing work of HR departments, thus allowing them to focus on the art of recruitment, people skills and culture fit. In the long run, this will not only benefit the organisation but also Singaore.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nAS commercial real estate developers, we at Castlewood Group see the cooling measures in real estate have forced the industry and investors to rethink their strategy for 2014. Traditional offerings will not cut the mustard with property yields anticipated to drop and stamp duty and taxes taking a significant bite out of projected profits. We should see a move towards tax-exempt overseas investments like our unique buy-to-lease hotel investment offerings, meaning that the Year of the Horse is a thoroughbred winner for our clients, prospective clients and our organisation. Those embracing change should emerge stronger from 2014's testing times, whereas those resisting the winds will most likely disappear, giving the property industry a timely shake-up.\n\nWe feel that Singapore's global appeal will continue to grow stronger in 2014, and the recent inspirational messages from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong resonate with national pride. To be Singaporean, whether native or immigrant, is to be the envy of the world, and as a Singaporean company we wish to see for ourselves and the nation a continued pursuit of excellence and prosperity in every aspect.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman / Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nWHILE I think that there would not be many surprises in the business climate in the Year of the Horse, I do hope that we will race like the horse towards any opportunities. In fact, we have been expanding our reach in Asia and I believe that other direct selling companies are doing the same. So, we would see the continuation of the race in the Year of the Horse. Of course, I would wish for my company to be ahead in the competition and further entrench our brands in the Asian markets. Nevertheless, for a home-grown company in Singapore, a strong economy with firm support for local SMEs would be even better for our operations (and Singaporean employees). So far, the economy is doing reasonably well and the government is implementing policies beneficial to the local SMEs. Therefore, I just wish that there is no surprise from the global economy.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nThe Year of the Horse looks to be a year where positive industry momentum in the energy space will drive demand for recruitment of engineering talent. A recent report by the Ministry of Manpower showed that among Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs), job openings for engineers are ample. With Singapore looking to develop itself further as Asia's energy hub, experienced engineers with niche skills will be in demand in the region. My wish for my organisation is that we will be able to fill this need and assist companies to source for and cultivate talent. In turn, my wish is their successes will continue to drive the overall business environment in Singapore as it remains one of the world's most robust economies. At the same time, we are looking to tap the opportunities that the regional energy boom will provide.\n\nAnton Ravindran\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nRapidstart\n\nACCORDING to reports, there will be stronger ICT spending in the Asia-Pacific (ex-Japan) region this year. The key driver is likely to be the Internet of Things which will have a profound impact on business and people's lives. Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses many aspects of business and life - from smart homes, connected cities, connected cars and roads, smart grids/energy, smart health services to devices that track an individual's behaviour. The IoT comprises smart devices interacting and communicating with other devices, objects, environments and infrastructures. However, a lack of IoT skills and knowledge among employees and businesses is viewed as the biggest impediment to leverage IoT optimally. The pervasiveness of embedded smart devices is already happening. Just as the Internet and Web phenomenon arrived not so long ago and permeated every aspect of business and life, the Internet of Things will also touch every facet of our lives more than the Internet and Worldwide Web. We need to be ready to leverage IoT, or be left behind in this revolution that would yet again profoundly change the way we work and live in Singapore.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE turns 50 years old next year, so from a global perspective, the country is only in its adolescence. The growing pains have been felt in recent years as Singapore's maturing economy and slowed growth brought about the need for economic restructuring and this, in turn, has led to social harmony coming under pressure. We are clearly still in a transition phase and I hope that the country can soon find a good equilibrium between healthy economic growth and maintaining a strong social fabric. It is thus my sincere wish that Singapore will prosper economically so that those living in the country will also find peace and prosperity in the Year of the Horse. As for my hopes for my industry, the tighter foreign worker policies has caused a major upheaval for many businesses but being in the search and recruitment industry, we stand to benefit from the resultant increased demand for Singaporeans and permanent resident workers. There will be growing demand for our staffing services this year. Generally, the Year of the Horse is said to bring luck and good tidings so I hope this year will be filled with abundance and blessings for all, with the economy racing ahead and individuals galloping ahead in their careers.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nAS we ring in the Year of the Horse, I wish everyone a blessed and prosperous business and personal year. The horse symbolises a driving force, what we thrive for in life and what we work hard towards; its beauty, strength and endurance are what many admire. Businesses are modelled the same way - it always needs to be a power that endures the test of time and its challenges. Although we expect 2014 to be trying, we will stay committed to our customers and partners in the market to create values and harmony for long lasting, successful partnerships. Each New Year is an opportunity for us to grow with change. Being in education we will continue focusing on educational trends and global growth. We will also continue to foster innovation and work towards creating important industry milestones. 2014 will give us the opportunity to augment our position. I also wish to see increased interest among our youth to see early childhood education as a potential career - a career that will enable them to fulfill their aspirations as educators who can help shape the future generation. As for Singapore, I wish for the continued solidarity and for people of all walks of life to co-exist peacefully. Over time it has become clear that we should never take the harmony that we have for granted.\n\nWilliam Chu\n\nPresident\n\nAvnet Technology Solutions Asia Pacific\n\nWITH Singapore's 2014 GDP growth estimated at between 2-4 per cent, Avnet Technology Solutions aims to continue our growth trajectory. The tech industry presents new opportunities in services, software and education, and we aim to capitalise on them by leveraging the strengths of our team, both here in Singapore and across Asia. Despite the tight labour market, Avnet's people are our greatest asset, and we are committed to ensuring our staff at all levels have lifelong learning opportunities. We encourage them to gain the expertise, skills and resources needed to accelerate the success of our customers and suppliers today and in the future.\n\nHowever, even as we pursue growth, we should not forget about the community supporting our expansion. As the Chinese saying goes, \"as you drink water, remember the source\". For the Chinese New Year, I wish our team, suppliers and customers prosperity, and to share their success with the less fortunate.\n\nLiu Chunlin\n\nCEO\n\nK&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd\n\nWE expect the Year of the Horse to bring along even greater success to the Security and Protective Solution industry that our business belongs to. For the past 10 years, our business, with good government support, has built up tremendous practical experience and earned the reputation as a leader in the regional security and protective solution industry. With these assets under our belts, we are now ready to take the next step. In 2014, we are expanding our business at a higher gear not just in the Greater China region but also in Malaysia. We are now considered a leader in our industry in the Asia & Pacific region, with staff who have the relevant skills and experience to reach a higher plateau of professional achievements. We will maximise the opportunity by riding on Singapore's infrastructural development in the next 20 years, and will certainly increase our wealth of knowledge, human resource, experience and financial assets. It's time for us to transform ourselves from a local enterprise into an international player, without forgetting our roots in Singapore.\n\nRod Rodericks\n\nVice-President and Managing Director, APAC\n\nZebra Technologies\n\nIN recent years, the challenge for automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology providers lies in helping businesses understand and navigate the transition towards Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT). Effective deployment of AIDC technologies and integrating legacy technology and processes seamlessly with the new can be a tricky process, but the benefits of being able to see more and do more can go a long way in helping leaders achieve their business ambitions.\n\nZebra Technologies believes that the impact of having a connected and visible value chain is particularly important as businesses face the challenge of achieving their goals amidst a manpower crunch, rising costs and stiff competition. Sustainable business success needs to be fueled by a knowledge-based workforce capable of doing more within the limited amount of resources available.\n\nThe Singapore government has seen this need and has put in place measures geared towards helping companies realise the full potential of data analytics and IoT in gathering deeper insights into business processes and turning them into impactful business decisions. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore's research reveals that data and analytics can help generate an additional S$10-17 billion for Singapore's economy, leading to the consequent growth of the market for AIDC technologies, like barcodes and RFID. This year, our wish for ourselves, our industry, and Singapore is greater connectivity and visibility throughout the value chain.\n\nMike Muller\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific\n\nAvaya\n\nToday's workplace has become hyper-connected, with employees using a host of different devices and platforms to work more effectively. The Year of the Horse promises to drive businesses in Singapore and across the region to address innovative enterprise mobility strategies, better models of collaboration and new ways to deliver a compelling customer experience. Consumer adoption and appetite for cutting-edge technologies is impacting infrastructure investment at all levels. 2014 presents an opportunity for businesses to create environments that are flexible enough to embrace, ride on and enable this new era of communications and new way of doing business. At Avaya, we are laser-focused on delivering open, mobile enterprise collaboration solutions that enable organisations of all sizes to work smarter, faster and better. From supporting large-scale events like the coming Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games as the official supplier of network equipment, to helping mid-market companies become more competitive with on-the-go video collaboration solutions, our goal for the Year of the Horse is to help accelerate this transformation in the way people work.\n\nSimon Barlow\n\nPresident\n\nCarlson Rezidor Hotel Group\n\nThe Year of the Horse holds great potential for the hospitality industry in Asia generally and Singapore specifically. The emerging market countries in Asia Pacific are growing rapidly, with strong consumer-led domestic economies and growing middle class wealth. Huge demand for domestic travel as well as booming international visitor growth is driving the demand for more hotels. We are seeing a surge in demand for mid-scale accommodation as intra-Asia travel continues to rise. The Gen Y traveller will shape the industry, with hotels such as our mid-market Park Inn by Radisson brand focusing more on technology-based services to capture this increasingly important market segment. Building on our strong growth momentum of the last three years, we have aggressive growth plans for the Year of the Horse. Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group in Asia will see 15 new hotels opening in the region this year, which will take our operating portfolio in Asia Pacific to 110 hotels by the end of this year. My wish for 2014 is that the world's financial markets are stable, and that people travel for business or leisure as frequently as they are able.\n\nLionel Lim\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nCA Technologies\n\nThe horse is a symbol of energy, passion and intelligence. These are qualities crucial for businesses to succeed. In a year of volatility and cautious optimism, it is necessary to be a gamer-changer, to constantly innovate and drive agility. I wish for CA Technologies, the IT industry and Singapore, a prosperous and successful year ahead.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/more-firms-venturing-overseas-property", "site_title": "More firms venturing into overseas property", "publish_date": null, "content": "More firms venturing into overseas property\n\nAustralia, UK, US hot spots; US$3.5b invested abroad in first 9 months of last year\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Firms have ramped up their geographical diversification efforts in recent months in a bid to escape Singapore's prohibitive property cooling measures. In the opening weeks of January alone, Aspial Corporation unveiled two acquisitions in Australia, Keppel Land agreed to purchase land in Indonesia and CapitaLand picked up yet another plot in China.\n\nAustralia, the United Kingdom and the United States have been firms' favourite hot spots. Several companies, including Hiap Hoe, AIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit, Aspial, and Suntec Reit, picked Australia for their first overseas acquisitions.\n\nHiap Hoe, for instance, bought a 40,489-square-foot site in Melbourne, which it intends to develop into a 425-unit project, and then quickly went on to snap up a commercial building at 380 Lonsdale Street and a retail and office property at 206 Bourke Street. The three acquisitions cost the company about A$177.6 million (S$198.4 million). Aspial bought a freehold commercial building in Melbourne for A$41.5 million, soon followed by a separate commercial building also in Melbourne for $42.3 million. It intends to redevelop the latter site into what will be the tallest building in the city, subject to aviation clearance.\n\nAmong Reits, AMP Capital picked up a 49-per cent stake in Optus Centre, a business park in Sydney, for A$184.4 million, while Suntec Reit bought 177-199 Pacific Highway, a freehold land and property with a 31-storey Grade A commercial tower that is targeted for completion in early 2016. These were the first overseas acquisitions for both Reits.\n\nAndrew Bird, chief investment officer (property) at AMP Capital, said he expected investment interest in Australian property to continue to remain high, particularly for the office and residential sector.\n\n\"The attraction of Australia (lies in its) high yield relative to other markets globally,\" said Mr Bird, noting that yields for prime property in Australia are about 6 per cent.\n\n\"When global investors look at property markets on a relative basis, they look at Australia and they see the high starting yield. And while the economy has softened a bit - the mining boom has slowed down - we are still looking at GDP growth of about 2.5 to 3 per cent,\" said Mr Bird.\n\nThe above two factors, plus sustained population growth through organic growth and immigration, are reasons why interest in Australia will likely remain high. That developers are looking elsewhere is perhaps not surprising, given plunging sales at home.\n\n\"New and adjusted local government policies in recent years that were meant to prevent a real estate asset bubble from forming and bursting, have, somewhat, limited the opportunities here for investors and developers,\" noted Chia Siew Chuin, director for research and advisory at Colliers International. \"In addition, the property playing field in Singapore has matured with many players bringing more diversity into the game, hence increasing the level of competition,\" she said.\n\nAccording to data released by DTZ, close to US$3.5 billion was invested overseas by Singapore-based investors in the first nine months of 2013.\n\nNotably, this figure does not take into account GIC's 50 per cent stake in London's Broadgate business district, a retail and commercial estate of 17 office buildings. While the consideration for GIC's purchase was not disclosed, reports placed the price tag at around \u00a31.7 billion (S$3.56 billion) - believed to be a record for a central London property.\n\nLondon has emerged a popular investment spot thanks to its reputation as a stable financial centre, said CBRE's Chris Brooke, executive managing director for Asia.\n\n\"Asian developers buying institutional Grade A office assets in London are driven by the feeling that London is a stable financial centre, offers reasonable yield, and is a long-term core holding. There is also the desire to have a flagship property in London,\" said Mr Brooke.\n\n\"(On the residential front) it is a good market to be building high quality residential homes notwithstanding the capital gains tax. The feeling is that demand will remain, even though it may trail off a little bit,\" he added.\n\nCity Developments Limited (CDL) and Oxley Holdings are among the firms that made forays into the London market in the last 12 months - CDL via a freehold plot near Harrods in Knightsbridge, which it intends to redevelop, and Oxley Holdings via a mixed development site at London's Royal Wharf.\n\nOther firms also entered the fray. Local construction group Lum Chang added a London hotel near the tourist attractions of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens to its growing list of London properties last year.\n\nProperty in the US also received its fair share of interest. SingHaiyi group - previously known as SingXpress Land - snapped up two distressed commercial projects in the US in the last few months, after Neil Bush, the brother of former US president George W Bush, was brought on board as non-executive chairman of SingHaiyi.\n\nThe two projects, Tri-County Mall in Ohio and Vietnam Town in California, were picked up for US$45 million and US$33.1 million respectively. Earlier this month, the group said that it is in talks to acquire another two to three assets in America.\n\nSeparately, OUE picked up California's tallest building - the US Bank Tower in Los Angeles - for US$367.5 million, while earlier this year GIC sealed a deal to buy office space in New York's Time Warner Centre with two partners, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and US real estate firm Related Companies, for US$1.3 billion.\n\nWhile many local firms have been acquiring plots overseas, one of the most active is local developer Oxley Holdings, which now has ventures in Malaysia, Cambodia and China.\n\nFollowing its first move abroad in May last year, in which it bought a firm with rights to a mixed-use site in Kuala Lumpur, Oxley Holdings has assembled an impressive portfolio of plots through a combination of joint ventures, development right agreements and acquisitions.\n\nIn January, the group said it signed a framework agreement with Sepang Goldcoast and Sepang Bay to develop land. The latter two hold interests in two parcels of 99-year-leasehold land with an aggregate area of about 47.3 hectares in Sepang. The joint-venture agreements entitle Oxley Treasure to 85 per cent of the gross development value of the developments on the land.\n\nAs to the future for acquisitions, some experts urge caution as the global economic recovery proceeds.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the DTZ Annual Property Outlook Seminar 2014 earlier this month, Dominic Brown, head of South East Asia/Australia and New Zealand Research, said: \"From an investment perspective, the main point is that (globally) property is not expected to get any more attractive on a relative value basis in the near term ... This stems from the fact that upside risks are now increasingly likely as the global economic recovery starts to gather momentum. This is a big shift from last year when a lot of focus was on what might happen if the eurozone broke up.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The shares in both companies fell.\n\nThe building in Tokyo's upscale neighbourhood, Aoyama, was found to require some construction repairs including to some of its pipes, Mitsubishi Estate said in a statement.\n\nThe project was constructed by Kajima along with Kandenko Co and Hamano Densetsu Inc, which make electrical and machinery facilities, according to the statement.\n\nThe details of the compensation amount will be decided at a later date, said Masayuki Watanabe, a spokesman for Mitsubishi Estate.\n\nResidential demand has increased in Japan ahead of the government's plan to increase consumption tax to 8 per cent from 5 per cent in April.\n\nHousing starts in the world's third-largest economy rose for a 16th month in December, the longest rising streak since the period ended February 1994, a government report showed last week.\n\n\"This incident seems to be a one-time issue,\" said Masahiro Mochizuki, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. \"I don't expect Mitsubishi Estate's reputation will be hurt by this incident. However, Kajima and Kandenko will have to share the cost burden and review their quality control.\"\n\nMitsubishi Estate shares dropped 2.9 per cent to 2,471 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo. Kajima slid 6.3 per cent to 358 yen, the biggest drop since May 27. Kandenko tumbled 6.7 per cent to 489 yen.\n\nMitsubishi Estate began investigating the construction after one of the buyers informed the Tokyo-based developer that there were some postings on the Internet about the defect on Dec 9, it said in the statement.\n\nThe developer had decided to halt the sale because it is unclear as to when it can hand over the apartments and that it may find additional defects, it said. The units cost as much as 350 million yen (S$3.75 million), with the majority of them around 140 million yen.\n\nA Japanese weekly magazine, Diamond, reported the halt first on Jan 30.\n\nKajima has apologised to Mitsubishi Estate, the builder said in a separate statement.\n\n\"We sincerely apologise for causing great inconvenience to the potential buyers and Mitsubishi Estate,\" Kajima said in a statement. \"We will make sure that such a case would never happen again by enforcing management of the construction.\"\n\nTakashi Nomoto, a spokesman at Kandenko, declined to comment other than to say the company is deciphering the situation now.\n\nMitsubishi Estate was originally expected to hand over the units on March 20, it said, adding that they are in discussions with the those who agreed to cancel the sale.\n\nEighty-three out of 86 units were under contract, said Chika Kanamori, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the developer.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

The latest policy stands on three pillars. Firstly, it tries to protect the interests of local car makers who will remain behind high tariff walls. Then, there is an attempt to find a profitable growth niche in the face of coming competition under the 2015 Asean Common Market proposals. As well, the policy is designed to keep the ruling party's political backers happy by retaining the \"approved permit\" scheme, putatively part of its affirmative action policies to help the Malay community.\n\nGiven that Malaysia's car industry as a whole accounts for 550,000 jobs and that Malaysia is almost saturated with motor vehicles - there are more than 20 million cars and motorcycles for a population of just 28 million - the Najib administration's cautious policy stance is understandable. But this strategy is likely to fall short in the face of global realities. To begin with, the global car industry suffers from overcapacity. So unless Malaysian cars become big export items, the industry will remain a small-time player even against regional giants such as Thailand and Indonesia, never mind the rest of the world. Malaysia produced only about 650,000 vehicles last year. Until 2003, it was the biggest passenger car manufacturing nation in Asean. But it has now been overtaken by both Thailand and Indonesia. Last year, Thailand produced more than 1.2 million cars and Indonesia produced about 1.1 million. Both of them continue to attract more foreign investment in the industry than Malaysia.\n\nUnder the new policy, Malaysia will make it easier for foreign car makers to get licences to make cars and motorcycles powered by hybrid or electric engines, which will enjoy tax free status until the end of next year. There is an offer of soft loans and grants to the tune of RM2.1 billion (S$801 million). Malaysia hopes to export 200,000 green cars by 2020. But here again, both Indonesia and Thailand have their own energy efficient vehicle projects. For instance, both Japanese car giants Toyota and Honda have spent billions on a new line of low-cost, green cars in Indonesia. Thailand has advanced plans for fuel-efficient city cars as well.\n\nSheltering Malaysia's two indigenous manufacturers, Proton and Perodua, from international competition, as this policy does, also means that these two companies need not try hard to prove themselves in export markets. Past attempts to break into the Australian and the British markets have not been very successful.\n\nPerhaps the best hope for Malaysia's car industry is for the two local players to shift away into other products. For instance, they could aim to become the Asean Common Market's hub for products ranging from farm and plantation equipment to military vehicles to recreational outboard motors. The country already has some well-regarded engineering schools which specialise in automation that could help them make the switch. A new direction would benefit the country and the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under its earlier name, Legend, it secured the biggest share in China's domestic market in 1996 and in the Asia-Pacific region three years later.\n\nIts 2003 decision to change the name of its PC brand from Legend to Lenovo in a bid to boost its sales abroad marked the beginning of its ascent to global pre-eminence.\n\nThat move was followed by a successful 2004 bid to serve as the exclusive computing technology provider for the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics and the 2008 Beijing Games, making it the first Chinese firm to become a major Olympic sponsor.\n\nBut it was Lenovo's 2005 acquisition of IBM's PC division for US$1.75 billion that cemented its rise, setting it on track to unseat Hewlett-Packard as the world's top PC vendor last year.\n\nLenovo now has PC products in more than 160 countries and has worked to build its global brand by recruiting celebrities such as basketball star Kobe Bryant and Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher, who the company named a \"product engineer\" for its new Yoga Tablet device.\n\nWith its Motorola purchase, Lenovo hopes to replicate its PC market success in the smartphone universe. The deal \"will immediately make Lenovo a strong global competitor in smartphones\", Lenovo chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing said.\n\nAs it did after the 2005 IBM deal, however, it faces tough odds. Lenovo is the No 2 smartphone maker in China with a 12.5 per cent market share in the third quarter of 2013, behind South Korea-based Samsung's 18.4 per cent.\n\nBut globally, Lenovo ranked fifth in the same quarter, with only 4.5 per cent market share. Its acquisition of Motorola is likely to bump it up to the No 3 spot, Mr Yang said, but it will remain well behind leaders Samsung and US tech giant Apple, with 31.3 per cent and 15.3 per cent, respectively.\n\nVarun Goel, head of portfolio management services at Karvy Stock Broking, noted that while Lenovo has succeeded in the world of PCs, the smartphone market is \"a very different ball game, with entrenched players like Apple and Samsung leading the fray\".\n\n\"While Lenovo has expertise in hardware, today's smartphone industry is driven by smarter softwares,\" Mr Goel told AFP.\n\n\"In the smartphone markets, Google's Android platform has been gaining strength. There is very little differentiation that Motorola's Android-powered phones currently have over Samsung, which uses the same platform.\"\n\n\"We are not sure if this acquisition will add long-term value to Lenovo's shareholders,\" he added. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

NCCPP is currently building a 1,320-megawatt coal-fired power plant along the coast of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, adjacent to Sembcorp's first power plant investment in India, Thermal Powertech Corporation India (TPCIL).\n\nThe proximity of the two plants will enable operational synergies, such as the use of common coal importation and logistics infrastructure. Both plants will also be run by the same Sembcorp management team in Nellore.\n\nThe acquisition doubles Sembcorp's power generation capacity in India and boosts its overall power capacity by 1.2 gigawatts from 2014 to 2016 when both plants will become ready, said Macquarie Equities Research analyst Somesh Kumar Agarwal.\n\nThe remaining 55 per cent of NCCPP remains jointly owned by Indian conglomerate NCC Ltd and Gayatri Energy Ventures, Semb-corp's project partner for the TPCIL plant.\n\nSembcorp said it had to obtain formal approval from the Indian authorities that the government's allocation of domestic coal supply for the project would stay unchanged with its taking up an additional stake before it exercised the option.\n\nSembcorp also has plans to take up an incremental 16 per cent stake in TPCIL, up from its current 49 per cent interest, with Gayatri Energy owning the rest. This will change majority ownership from Gayatri's hands to Sembcorp.\n\nBoth power projects, located in India's southern region where economic growth and the demand for electricity is strong, will go towards meeting the country's rising power needs, Sembcorp said.\n\nUrbanisation, industrialisation and the growth of the middle class is expected to drive energy demand and the growth of India's power sector substantially over the next decade.\n\nConstruction of the NCCPP project is about 30 per cent completed and is expected to come onstream in early 2016.\n\nSembcorp's existing TPCIL project is also nearing completion. It is more than 80 per cent finished, with commercial operations targeted to begin in the third quarter of 2014 and the plant's second, 660-megawatt unit expected to start work by the end of the year.\n\n\"We believe this year will be slow for Sembcorp's utilities business as there is no new power plant to come on board in 2014 besides TPCIL, while Singapore's power prices may be under pressure,\" said Mr Agarwal.\n\nSembcorp will fund the acquisition with internal funds and borrowings.\n\nIts shares closed five cents lower at $5.20 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Our experimental Singapore collection of 10 randomly chosen stocks is down 1.9 per cent year-to-date.\n\nHowever, we managed to beat the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), which was down 4.4 per cent. The STI also performed worse than other major indices like the MSCI World (-3.8 per cent) and America's S&P 500 (-3.6 per cent).\n\nDespite being dragged down by OCBC Bank and Craft Print International, the rest of the portfolio stayed stable, partly due to some illiquid stocks and the outperformance of the shipping companies in the portfolio.\n\nIf the year so far was marked by emerging market worries as the US Federal Reserve ends or \"tapers\" its massive bond-buying programme, the BT Random Fund has also been, well, tapering at the ends.\n\nThe two clear underperformers in the course of the month were the largest and the smallest stocks in the portfolio. OCBC Bank, with its $32-billion market cap and ranked by Bloomberg Markets in 2012 as the World's Strongest Bank, shed 8.8 per cent of its market value in January and dragged our fund down. (Not a bad consolation number, actually, since we're in the Chinese New Year period.)\n\nIt is now trading at the bottom of its 52-week range. The bank is in exclusive talks to take over Hong Kong's family-owned Wing Hang Bank, and investors have been bailing out on fears that the bank is overpaying for the acquisition, leading to a future equity-raising exercise that will dilute their capital.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Craft Print International, the printing company that has made seven years of losses in a row. It is now valued at $3.9 million and down 14.8 per cent. To be fair, the company is not actively traded anyway, with just four trades totalling 39,000 shares and a total value traded of $883 (there's the double eight again, huatah!) made in the last two months, so some volatility is expected on tiny trades made.\n\nThe company held its annual general meeting on Jan 23 and all resolutions were passed unanimously. Here's hoping the company does not make an eighth year of losses.\n\nOur top performer was China-based Southern Packing Group, which makes plastic packaging for customers. The company is up 4.3 per cent year-to-date, but on thin trading activity. It said on Jan 16 that it has completed building and relocating its operations to two new factories.\n\nOne is expected to \"enhance the group's production capacity for rigid packaging materials\" and the other has new equipment to \"enhance injection stretch blow moulding and extrusion blow moulding capacities\" to meet the demands of the food and beverages and personal care packaging materials markets in the Yangtze Delta region.\n\nMeanwhile, the three shipping companies in our portfolio gave stable returns. Nam Cheong (+1.6 per cent) said on Jan 28 that it sold four vessels for US$70 million to a repeat customer. Rickmers Maritime Trust (no change) said it used US$5.8 million from a previous rights issue to repay bank loans. Singapore Shipping Corp said it sold a 30-year-old car cargo ship for US$5.1 million, US$0.9 million above the ship's end-2013 book value. The counter is up 2.3 per cent year-to-date, making it the second best performer in our portfolio.\n\nThere were no announcements for PCI Limited, AEI Corp and Jacks International in the past month. Malacca Trust Limited, which is undergoing a delisting process, said that the group making the exit offer currently holds 98.3 per cent of total shares. We will replace this counter with another randomly picked one after it gets delisted.\n\nAfter a glum start to the year, we can only hope markets do better. An 8.8 per cent return for the year, anyone? It's not much, but we take what we can.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Inflows into hedge funds are set to jump 25 per cent this year to the most since 2007, Barclays said last month, citing a survey of investors.\n\nCME Group, the world's biggest listed exchange, and units of Deutsche Boerse, the fourth-largest, have offices in Singapore as the firms jostle for a share of the Asian market.\n\nASX's expansion into Singapore comes about three years after it had an A$8.3 billion (S$9.3 billion) merger with Singapore Exchange, Asia's fourth-largest listed exchange, vetoed by the government. The firm's international ambitions were dented when former treasurer Wayne Swan rejected the tie-up, saying that the move amounted to a takeover and wasn't in the national interest.\n\nThe exchange will report results for the first half of the 2014 financial year on Feb 13. Derivatives contributed 32 per cent of total revenue in the year through June 30, 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nASX shares rose 20 per cent last year, compared with a 3.6 per cent gain for Singapore Exchange. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing slid 2 per cent and Japan Exchange Group surged fourfold since it began trading last January through the end of the year. ASX dropped 0.3 per cent to A$35.51 as at 10.42 am in Sydney yesterday, after a 3.1 per cent monthly decline in January.\n\nThe bourse will in April start offering asset managers the ability to lodge collateral for derivatives trades with the exchange rather than their brokers, a product it's calling client clearing, Mr Hiom said. Australian customers of a unit of MF Global Holdings, which collapsed in October 2011 after a US$6.3 billion bet on bonds of some of Europe's most indebted nations, faced lengthy battles in foreign courts to get repaid.\n\n\"MF Global is just an example of why you have to focus on this,\" Mr Hiom said. \"But the reason is regulatory change globally.\"\n\nClearing houses cut risk by collecting collateral to back each transaction, monitoring daily price moves and making traders put up more cash as losses occur. Venues such as LCH Clearnet Group, which last year was granted a licence to operate in Australia, and those run by US exchanges CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange Group have become more important to the financial system as regulators globally push more trades through them.\n\nThe US Dodd-Frank Act requires clearing for most swap contracts after the Group of 20 agreed in 2009 to promote the use of clearing houses to improve the stability of the global financial system.\n\n\"The client clearing service is an important extension of the OTC clearing service we provide,\" said Mr Hiom. \"It's about delivering that as an onshore solution.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

The stock fell.\n\nThe provision brings the total the lender has set aside to compensate clients sold payment-protection insurance (PPI) to \u00a39.8 billion, more than any other British lender.\n\nThe bank expects to report a \"small\" pretax profit for 2013, London-based Lloyds said in a statement yesterday.\n\nChief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio's efforts to resume paying a dividend are being hampered by the rising cost of regulatory mis-steps. Lloyds last paid a cash dividend in 2008, before its takeover of HBOS plc forced it to seek a \u00a320 billion bailout.\n\nAfter talks with the Prudential Regulatory Authority, Lloyds said it will make a formal application in the second half for permission to resume payments.\n\n\"No dividends for 2013 will be taken as a negative by income funds which were positioned for a build-up in payouts in 2014,\" said Chirantan Barua, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in London, who rates the lender \"outperform\".\n\nLloyds fell 2.8 per cent to 81 pence by 10am in London, making it the worst performer among Britain's five largest banks yesterday. The stock is still above the average 73.6 pence a share the government paid for its holding.\n\nThe bank said it expects to start dividends at a \"modest\" level and pay out about 50 per cent of earnings to shareholders over the medium term.\n\nThe \"dividend payment was expected to have commenced at the beginning of 2014\", Shailesh Raikundlia, an analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank with a sell recommendation on the stock, wrote in a report to clients. \"There were also expectations that the payout ratio would be much higher than 50 per cent going forward.\"\n\nLloyds said it expects full-year underlying profit to more than double to \u00a36.2 billion for 2013, more than the \u00a35.84 billion estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by the bank.\n\nUK banks have now set aside almost \u00a319 billion in compensation for clients who were sold insurance on loan repayments that didn't cover them or that they didn't require.\n\nBarclays has earmarked about \u00a34 billion, Royal Bank of Scotland Group \u00a33.1 billion and HSBC Holdings \u00a31.8 billion.\n\nThe volume of PPI complaints is falling, with the average monthly number of complaints down 24 per cent compared with the third quarter and 56 per cent below those in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Lloyds.\n\nThe lender will also set aside a further \u00a3130 million to cover the cost of compensating small businesses wrongly sold interest-rate hedging products such as swaps, bringing the total so far to \u00a3530 million.\n\nThe bank's net interest margin, the difference between its income from lending and its cost of funding, widened to 2.12 per cent for the year from 1.93 per cent for 2012. Lloyds's core Tier 1 capital ratio under the full Basel III rules, a key measure of financial health, rose to 10.3 per cent, from 8.1 per cent for 2012.\n\nThe bank also said preparations are under way for a sale of government shares in Lloyds to the public. The government sold a \u00a33.2 billion stake in the company to money managers in September.\n\nThe sale to the public is unlikely to be affected by yesterday's news, according to Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec plc in London with a hold recommendation on the shares.\n\nInvestors had expected only a token 0.5 pence a share dividend for 2013 \"while the future dividend- paying capability remains clear\", he wrote in a note to clients yesterday. - Bloom-berg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

The ID needs to prove that he or she can be trusted and is not there as a policeman.\"\n\nThe dilemma\n\nThe chairman succinctly captured the dilemma of substantial shareholders of listed companies.\n\nOn the one hand, the pressure is for them to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance which stipulates that: \"There should be a strong and independent element on the Board, which is able to exercise objective judgement on corporate affairs independently, in particular, from management and 10 per cent shareholders. No individual or small group of individuals should be allowed to dominate the Board's decision making.\"\n\nThe Code has specific guidelines on what makes a director independent. But, in principle, an ID should be one who can make objective judgements without any vested interest, any conflict of interest, or the undue influence of interested parties.\n\nOn the other hand, it is human nature to prefer to work with people who generally agree with us, people who share similar backgrounds as us.\n\nThat is why we have the current situation where a large number of IDs appointed tend to be friends of, or, at least, personally known to existing board members or management.\n\nRole of independent directors\n\nGood corporate governance requires a framework for directors to exercise their fiduciary duties and work with management to deliver long-term and sustainable value for the company.\n\nIDs have a big part to play in that framework. They are valued for the independence in their views and their ability to bring diversity and an outside perspective into the board meetings. They aid in balancing the interests of the shareholders, employees and creditors.\n\nIn addition, independent directors also bring with them their expertise, experience and leadership qualities.\n\nIn theory, independent directors - chosen well, and given the right support and cooperation - can add significant value to companies.\n\nHowever, in practice, some of the worst corporate failures have been boards which, on paper, are made up of predominantly IDs. Of Enron's 17 board members, 82 per cent were independents. It had a non-executive chairman and its Audit Committee comprised all IDs. Other major corporate failures such as WorldCom, Tyco, and HIH Insurance all shared similar statistics.\n\nTruly independent?\n\nThe problem may, however, lie in whether the IDs are indeed truly independent. Those who are roped in by friends are likely to place their loyalties with their friends. Those who stayed long enough on the same board can become close buddies with management.\n\nIn one listed company that I came across, a director who is identified as an ID and sits on the company's Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee, is the brother-in-law of the company's executive chairman and CEO.\n\nAlthough technically the Code does not specifically preclude a CEO's brother-in-law from being an ID, the relationship does raise the issue of whether the director is or can be truly independent. The notion of independence should comply with the spirit, not just the letter of the Code.\n\nIndependence of judgement, sufficiency of self-esteem and confidence to stand up for an independent point of view, and a firm commitment to serve all shareholders with due diligence and integrity - these are hallmarks or tests of true independence.\n\nHowever, these characteristics are by no means easy to ascertain. Which is why the next best thing may be to shine the spotlight on the search and nomination process of IDs.\n\nStronger emphasis should be put on the objectivity and transparency of the search process. There has to be proper due diligence done to match the competencies and capabilities of independent directors with the company's needs.\n\nTo cater to this need, the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) has a Board Appointment Service. It is working with a professional search firm to help companies find potential candidates for boards. There are more than 1,700 individual directors in SID's membership database alone, making it a lame excuse that there are not enough qualified IDs in Singapore.\n\nOn the part of substantial shareholders, they have to get over the mental block that IDs are \"policemen\". Independent-minded IDs with prerequisite skills, domain knowledge and contacts are a valuable part of the team that can ensure long-term performance, resilience and sustainability of the company.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Governing Council of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nFor more articles, go to\n\nbtd.sg/BMatters\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Stock market bears are likely licking their chops, thinking of the old adage that \"as goes January, so goes the year\".\n\nWhether or not the January slide continues depends on whether financial instability in Argentina, Turkey and other over-leveraged emerging markets leads to the defaults and currency devaluations that characterised the last emerging markets crisis, in 1997 and 1998.\n\n\"People are worried about 1990s style Asian contagion,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services. \"First of all it's way too early to make those kinds of comparisons.\"\n\nWhat started as a Korean problem in 1997 quickly spread to Thailand, Singapore and other \"Tiger\" economies before hitting Russia and Latin America. These nations were in a similar position as Greece found itself in two years ago - but they did not have the European Union standing behind them with all its financial might.\n\nThat crisis simmered for months before a default by Russia triggered a panic in the summer of 1998. That fall, the United States Fed intervened twice in the space of a month to prevent the financial crisis from becoming an economic one in the US. When traders look back at the rocket-ship stock charts of the 1990s, the crisis is often forgotten. But it triggered recessions worldwide, including one that took Japan 15 years to shake off.\n\nOne reason this emerging markets crisis could be the 1990s edition is that central banks have intervention fatigue. After five years of deploying the bazooka, Ben Bernanke began the process of decommissioning the Federal Reserve's stimulus weapons. Last Wednesday, at the last meeting presided over by Mr Bernanke in January, the rate setting committee, including incoming chairwoman Janet Yellen, voted unanimously to continue the \"tapering\" begun in December, despite the ongoing turmoil in emerging markets.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session after a speech in Texas on Friday, Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said he would bring the monthly bond purchases by the Fed to zero \"as soon as practicable\". While US central bankers are monitoring the situation in emerging markets, they have not yet seen signs it's as severe as the 1990s crisis, said Mr Fisher, who is a voting member of the rate-setting board this year. For now, Mr Fisher said, the Fed did not foresee the crisis changing the course of its tapering plan. Nations like Brazil, Argentina and Turkey would have to depend on their own central banks and governments to save them from default.\n\n\"It is not in our purview to be the world's central bank,\" said Mr Fisher. \"We're subject to the US Congress.\"\n\nThe Fed's insouciance in the face of financial unease reassured one observer that Ms Yellen would have a steady hand as the new leader. \"It's a positive rather than a negative,\" said Mr Pursche, of Gary Goldberg. \"It would have sent a much worse signal if they had cited the emerging markets crisis and reacted to it.\"\n\nMr Fisher and other Fed officials have expressed satisfaction with the uptick in economic growth recently.\n\nThe December jobs report due on Friday is likely to show some acceleration in labour market growth with roughly 180,000 net new hires nationwide, more than double the December tally.\n\nMr Pursche said stronger growth is also evident in corporate earnings reports. While there are some high-profile disappointments - particularly among consumer companies such as Walmart Stores, Amazon.com and United Parcel Service, all of whom missed holiday sales season targets - the rate of corporate growth is generally strong.\n\nOverall, fourth quarter profits for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies likely grew 8.9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters. Some companies, such as Google and Facebook, have even surpassed ambitious growth targets. This week, auto maker General Motors and messaging service Twitter are among those who will weigh in with their results. The January selloff was largely based on \"sentiment\", Mr Pursche said. \"The fundamental picture remains intact,\" he added.\n\nIn a research note outlining investing themes for 2014, analysts at brokerage Credit Suisse said the pace of growth worldwide and a \"cash-rich corporate sector\" suggest that corporate spending will pick up this year. Corporations have been unusually parsimonious in the first three years of the recovery and may soon begin to rebuild plants and buy new technology. Indeed, Eric Marshall at mutual fund firm Hodges Capital is shopping for shares of steel makers concentrated on commercial buildings in anticipation of such investment.\n\nMr Marshall said that the recent selloff was \"what happens in normal bull market: you move up gradually, and you correct sharply. That's a healthy thing.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of the projected 7.3 per cent demand, solar PV systems are expected to generate 4.8 per cent, or 2,400 GWh annually; biomass, 1.6 per cent, or 785 GWh annually; biogas, 0.7 per cent, or 350 GWh annually; wind, 0.2 per cent or 80 GWh annually; and tidal power, 20 GWh annually.\n\nOne way to fully harness the potential of biomass and biogas is to legislate waste as a \"designated commodity\", where waste collection companies are required to report the waste they generate.\n\nOther recommendations include the introduction of acceptable standards for biomass power plants to maximise energy extraction from limited biomass fuel.\n\nTo maximise energy recovery from biomass waste, SEAS proposed that the National Environment Agency (NEA) should only grant licences for future biomass projects that adopt at least a co-generation system.\n\nIn August 2012, NEA imposed restrictions to prohibit the incineration of recyclable wood and horticulture waste, which should lead to more of such waste being recycled as biomass fuel.\n\nBut sufficient amounts of pure food waste, by far the largest amount of digestible organic waste in Singapore, are still difficult to obtain, SEAS said. That's because there currently are no laws mandating the segregation of organic waste at the site it is generated, for instance, within HDB households. There is also insufficient space for the segregation of organic waste at current waste segregation facilities.\n\nOther barriers to renewable energy (RE) adoption include restrictions on feeding RE generation directly into the power grid.\n\nThe Energy Market Company, which operates and administers Singapore's wholesale electricity market, currently has no energy trading tool that allows for the ready sale of renewable energy. In addition, contestable customers are not able to sell excess RE to the grid. But the Energy Market Authority, in a consultation paper released on Oct 28, 2013, is addressing both these issues.\n\nAn increased uptake of PV is expected to create clean tech clusters in Singapore that will help build a sustainable green economy and create more green jobs. Case in point, as annual PV deployment in Singapore is projected to grow to 200 megawatt peak (MWp) in 2017 from 10 MWp in 2013, the number of full-time jobs in the solar energy production sector could jump to 6,000 from 2017 onwards from just 30 at the end of 2012, SEAS said, citing estimates from the European Photovoltaic Industry Association.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't want to waste money on Toto anymore, not with my lousy bonus. I'm stressed about working so hard in this city. I'm tired of thinking we'll go nowhere with our financial lives. And I think a million dollars is a nice, round number - big enough to mean something. Of course, life is not about the money. But we can still do a lot of things with it. After all, ai bia jia eh yia (those who fight can win). And we can do this together. So shall we?\"\n\nThe reply: \"That's the spirit! That's why I married you. But how?\"\n\nHang on a second\n\nAssuming tiny, rich Singapore is still around and economically successful 30 or 40 years from now, $1 million may well be within reach for a sizeable number of households. Already, more than a sixth of households here have US$1 million in investable financial assets, excluding their home, said the Boston Consulting Group in 2012.\n\nIn fact, the average household earned $125,000 that year, and the median household, around $100,000, when employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions are included. Given negligible personal income taxes at these levels, the median household can effectively earn $1 million in income in 10 years without the government taking away a big chunk. If they are smart with their money, they can save up to $1 million within their lifetime.\n\nA generation ago, having $1 million was an incomprehensible thought for most people. Even now, the sum is still regarded as the holy grail of wealth for most.\n\nOh, you might complain, the cost of living in Singapore is so high. Surely a million dollars doesn't count for much anymore? And even if my household earns $100,000 a year, most of that is spent just getting by. Restaurant food is expensive. Condos are priced at a million dollars or more. Cars are priced at well over $100,000, and so on.\n\nKeep in mind that hawker food is ubiquitous, cheap and delicious. A new four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat costs $250,000. Journeys can be made for $2 or less on public transport. And while we're at this, think about how hundreds of millions of people around the world still live on a dollar or less a day.\n\nJust live in any neighbouring country and you might find $1 million will already set you up for life.\n\nHere, the lowest-paid, low-skilled jobs pay around $1,000 a month. We pay our maids $500 a month. Construction workers make around $700. People get by on these salaries, too, saving less in a year than what other people spend on a typical holiday abroad.\n\nIf a plate of chicken rice costs $2.50, $1 million can still feed a family of four chicken rice for lunch and dinner for 50,000 days, or almost 140 years. Assuming chicken rice inflation of 2 per cent a year, you are still looking at almost 70 years - just about a lifetime - and that's assuming you don't earn a return on your chicken rice fund.\n\nWith this background in mind, let us find out how fast a typical household in Singapore can accumulate a million dollars in wealth, after accounting for spending needs.\n\nThe major caveat is that different people spend differently.\n\nAnother key assumption is that individuals remain healthy and able to work, are not hit by major catastrophes or retrenchments, and do not have to provide for elderly parents.\n\nMany households above and below the median struggle to make ends meet for various reasons beyond their control. They fall outside the scope of this article, a mathematical exercise focusing on dual-income households, a powerful economic unit here.\n\nWe assume the household earns $10,000 a month, including employer CPF contributions. This works out to two individuals earning $4,300 monthly each, without employer CPF. This places these individuals at above median income levels, but below the top 25 per cent.\n\nThe conclusion of this article might already be familiar to readers: you can shave years off your retirement goals by raising the proportion of income you invest. But the details are always interesting. Lower spending levels make a big difference, even if you receive average investment returns on your savings.\n\nThe power of two\n\nDual-income couples who earn above-median incomes, but not too much above-median, are doubly blessed here. They not only get to live in relatively affordable, subsidised housing, but also enjoy negligible tax rates and further tax breaks when they have children. A couple can also accumulate wealth more quickly by sharing the basic necessities of life.\n\nOur analysis centres on a working couple with a household income of $10,000 a month. This is right at the top of the HDB income limit to buy new flats. Each person in the couple earns, on average, $5,000 a month ($4,300 without employer CPF), or $60,000 a year. This level can arguably be reached by many university-educated professionals in their early 30s, assuming starting salaries of $3,000 (the median wage excluding bonuses earned by fresh graduates in 2012) and increments of $200-300 a year.\n\nThe gross salary excluding employer CPF of $4,300 thus puts the individual at around the 70th percentile of wage-earners here. The 65th to 75th percentiles of individual earners, excluding employer CPF, earned $4,000 to $5,000 in 2012, with the median at $3,000.\n\nAt this stage, the couple may have already bought an HDB flat and be paying down their mortgage. Some 23 per cent of their gross monthly salary excluding employer CPF goes into the Ordinary Account (OA) used for house loans, dropping to 21 per cent at age 35 and 19 per cent from age 45 to 50.\n\nAssuming a blanket rate of 20 per cent, more than $1,600 goes into the couple's CPF OA each month out of their combined monthly income of $8,600.\n\nWith these salaries, they can buy a $500,000 flat without having to fork out money in cash, assuming they take an HDB 30-year loan with a typical 20 per cent downpayment and excluding grants. A new flat is likely to be far cheaper, with prices of new four-room flats in non-mature estates starting at $250,000.\n\nWe assume our couple buys at a price somewhere in between, and thus does not need to fork out any cash for their monthly mortgage payments.\n\nAfter CPF deductions and taxes, they will be looking at a combined disposable income of about $6,800 a month. To be conservative in our calculations, we assume that this income stays stagnant for the rest of their lives. Any increases can go towards unexpected costs or lifestyle improvement.\n\nSpending estimates\n\nNow, the couple might have a child in tow. Maybe they go for overseas holidays once or twice a year, or have a car. On weekends, they shop in nearby malls, eat at restaurants or hawker centres, surf the Web and watch TV, have a barbecue at East Coast Park, visit Sentosa, watch the latest movie, fiddle with their latest smartphone or camera, visit family and friends, take a trip to Johor, Bangkok or Hong Kong - all typically Singaporean activities.\n\nRetirement is far off and they are just getting started in life. They have $6,800 a month to chart their path to a seven-digit bank account. What can they do?\n\nEasy mode\n\n\"But my dear,\" wails the other half - presumably privately and not on Facebook like formerly Singapore-based British expat Anton Casey - \"surely you don't want to live like those smelly people on public transport, right? I don't want to make any change to my life!\"\n\n(Note: This smelly writer takes public transport all the time.)\n\nAll right. This couple could be paying off a car loan, eating out at restaurants and going on holidays or even employing a maid to look after the baby. Let's say they spend most of their money every month - $5,800, for example, putting them in the top 20 per cent of average household expenditure by income in 2007/8, and the next 20 per cent today after inflation of 5 per cent a year.\n\nThis is a comfortably above-average level of spending, arguably just about what their peers in a similar income bracket would spend. But this leaves our couple with combined savings of just $1,000 a month, or a savings rate of 15 per cent.\n\nAnd let's say that after working for 5-10 years, they have $20,000 of cash in the bank to start investing with, which is what you get if each person saves just $100 or $200 a month.\n\nAssuming their salaries are fixed until their retirement at 65, they can actually become a millionaire household by retirement - as long as they start investing what they save.They will take 33 years from the day they start, assuming investment returns of 5 per cent a year.\n\nWhy 5 per cent? Insurance companies now use a rate of return of 5 per cent in their calculations, having factored in the low-interest-rate environment.\n\nUltra-safe AAA-rated long-term bonds of 10 years or longer now trade at yields of 3-4 per cent. This is likely to rise, as cheap money comes to an end with economic growth and the US withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Straits Times Index (STI) stocks already give dividend yields of 3-4 per cent a month; real estate investment trusts (Reits) give returns of 6-8 per cent.\n\nFactor in a little capital appreciation over time, and 5 per cent returns are not too farfetched. In fact, that's below the long-term average of 7 per cent that stocks usually return, giving us a sizeable margin of safety to begin our calculations.\n\nNormal mode\n\n\"Let's spend like normal people. Let's not deny ourselves anything that normal households enjoy, but not do anything too extreme either,\" says one half.\n\nIf our (above-median) couple spends like the median household, they will blow $4,600 a month here, based on figures from the last household expenditure survey, after factoring in inflation of 5 per cent a year.\n\nThis leaves them with $2,200 a month, about a third of their take-home pay, to invest. We also assume this couple is more thrifty than the previous one, and they have saved $50,000 in their bank. How long will they take to reach seven figures? Starting with a little bit more and investing $1,200 more a month, compared to the previous \"easy mode\" option, will save the couple 13 years. This couple will reach millionaire household-hood by the end of year 20, well before retirement, just as the kids are entering higher education.\n\nHardcore mode\n\nNow, there is a way to become a millionaire household far quicker than any get-rich-quick guidebook can tell you, though few are likely to do this: living as minimally as possible.\n\nIt is an extreme option, but not impossible. But assuming our couple wants to try, how fast can they get to $1 million? They have $6,800 a month, and willpower to match. They may have a baby, but junior is too young to expect a Montessori education, Kumon-method classes and a maid to carry his bag for him. Parents on both sides can chip in to help look after this junior.\n\nLet's run through the basic numbers, assuming a couple and one child. Public transport costs about $150 a month per person, excluding baby. Cook at home or eat at hawker centres, and monthly food expenses can be kept under $250 per person.\n\nPAP kindergartens are heavily subsidised, with school fees at around $100 a month. We assume this money goes towards miscellaneous school fees later on. Household utilities, Internet and cellphone bills add up to another $500. This totals up to $1,650.\n\nA key component of financial planning is insurance, but we do not need to add additional costs here. Medisave can typically cover the cost of a basic integrated shield plan before age 65. There is also a Medisave grant of $3,000 for newborns. Term life insurance, meanwhile, is inexpensive, with Aviva's SAF Group Insurance scheme offering $100,000 of protection for $12.80 a month, and $10 to dependants. Build in a buffer for miscellaneous expenses and we get total expenses of $1,800 to $2,000 a month, leaving us with savings of, say, $5,000 a month - a savings rate of nearly 75 per cent.\n\nLet's assume, moreover, that the couple has $100,000 in the bank between them - not an impossible sum to achieve by age 30, even for a typical young working graduate saving alone in Singapore, as other financial writers and bloggers have pointed out.\n\nAt this rate of investing, the couple gets to $1 million at the end of their 11th year.\n\nThis calculation does not factor in other things the couple can do to speed up the journey: they can rent out a room in their flat, offer tuition or scrounge for hand-me-down clothes for their growing child. At work, they can get promotions and more rapid pay increases. They may well have hit their target before 10 years.\n\nTo conclude, we presented three early- 30s, dual-income couples earning the Singapore household income average of $10,000 a month. This works out to an average of $5,000 a month per person, roughly at the 70th percentile of individual incomes here.\n\nOne couple spends like their peers, another spends at the level of a typical household, and the last goes all out to reach the million-dollar mark.\n\nAll three can theoretically reach their goals within their lifetime within 30, 20 or 10 years, depending on how hard they try to rein in their spending.\n\nWhat does one do with $1 million? That's another story. But here's hoping the money doesn't get used to speculate on property.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Buyers outnumbered sellers with 11 companies that recorded 21 purchases worth $3.7 million versus a paltry two firms with five disposals worth $350,000.\n\nThe number of companies and trades on the buying side were not far off from the previous week's five-day totals of nine firms and 23 acquisitions. The buy value, however, was sharply down from the previous week's purchases worth $7.86 million. The sales, on the other hand, were consistent with the previous week's low totals of four companies, nine disposals, and $590,000.\n\nWhile the buying by directors rebounded last week, the buyback activity plunged with only three firms that posted five repurchases worth $1.83 million. The figures were sharply down from the previous week's seven companies, 18 trades and $8.08 million.\n\nDespite the short trading week, there were several significant corporate shareholder trades. Courts Asia bought back more shares. The trades were significant as the buybacks by the group along with the purchases by a director since the last week of December have accounted for more than 14 per cent of the stock's trading volume.\n\nOn the directors' side, there were insider buys in Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust and Neo Group. On the substantial shareholders front, there were purchases in Soilbuild Business Space Reit and disposals in Croesus Retail Trust, Ascendas Hospitality Trust and Eu Yan Sang International.\n\nCourts Asia\n\nThere were buybacks and purchases by non-executive director Adnan Abdulaziz Ahmed AlBahar in electrical, IT and furniture products retailer Courts Asia with a combined 1.456 million shares purchased from Dec 31, 2013, to Jan 27 at an average of 62.3 cents each.\n\nThe trades accounted for 14 per cent of the stock's trading volume. Courts Asia bought back 456,000 shares from Jan 2 to 27 at an average of 61.3 cents each.\n\nThe group last bought back 100,000 shares on Jan 27 at 59 cents each. The group previously acquired 2.64 million shares from Dec 18 to 20, 2013, at 59 cents each and 1.4 million shares from Oct 21 to Nov 13, 2013, at 82 cents to 69.5 cents each or an average of 76.8 cents each.\n\nThe repurchases since October 2013 are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in October 2012. The group's last buyback price was lower than the IPO's 77 cents. Mr Adnan AlBahar, on the other hand, acquired an initial one million shares from Dec 31, 2013, to Jan 3 at an average of 62.8 cents each.\n\nThe shares bought represented 0.18 per cent of the issued capital. Those are his first on-market trades since listing. His purchases were made on the back of the 45-per cent drop in the share price since May 2013 from $1.145. Investors should note that CEO Terence Donald O'Connor purchased 3.56 million shares from Nov 28 to Dec 5, 2013, at an average of 64.5 cents each, which increased his holdings (direct and deemed) to 16.984 million shares or 3.035 per cent. He previously acquired 80,000 shares in November 2012 at 74 cents each. The stock closed at 58.5 cents on Thursday.\n\nMapletree Greater China Commercial Trust\n\nNon-executive director Chua Tiow Chye recorded his first on-market trade in real estate investment trust Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust (MGCCT) since June 2013 with 300,000 units purchased on Jan 29 at 80.5 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 30 per cent to 1.300 million units or 0.04 per cent of the issued capital.\n\nThe acquisition was made on the back of the 17-per cent drop in the unit price since September 2013 from 96.5 cents. The purchase was also made after MGCCT announced, on Jan 23, a 16.6 per cent gain in income available for distribution to unit holders to $40.613 million for the third quarter while the results in the first nine months rose by 12.4 per cent to $125.59 million. He previously acquired 170,000 units in June 2013 at 97 cents each. The purchases since June 2013 are the director's first on-market trades since the unit trust was listed in March 2013. Mr Chua's last purchase price was lower than the IPO's 93 cents.\n\nInvestors should note that non-executive director Hiew Yoon Khong purchased 270,000 units on Nov 1, 2013 at 93 cents each, which boosted his deemed stake by 17 per cent to 1.870 million units or 0.07 per cent.\n\nHe also has direct interest of 830,000 units or 0.03 per cent. He previously acquired 600,000 units in June 2013 at 98 cents each and an initial one million units (deemed) or 0.03 per cent in March 2013 at $1.04 each. The unit trust closed at 81.5 cents on Thursday.\n\nNeo Group\n\nIndependent director Kevin Ng How Hwan resumed buying shares of food-catering firm Neo Group at higher than his previous acquisition prices with 64,000 shares purchased on Jan 24 at 80 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 20 per cent to 389,000 shares or 0.27 per cent. He previously acquired 150,000 shares from Sept 11 to Dec 13, 2013, at 51 cents to 60 cents each or an average of 57 cents each.\n\nThe purchases since September 2013 are Mr Ng's first on-market trades since the stock was listed in July 2012. The director's purchase prices were sharply higher than the IPO price of 30 cents. Investors should note that founder, chairman and CEO Neo Kah Kiat purchased 460,000 shares on Oct 1, 2013, at 51 cents each, which boosted his direct stake to 100.742 million shares or 69.96 per cent. He also has deemed interest of 8.064 million shares or 5.6 per cent. He previously acquired 582,000 shares in September 2012 at an average of 33.4 cents each. The counter closed at 81 cents on Thursday.\n\nSoilbuild Business Space Reit\n\nWealthy Fountain Holdings Inc became a substantial shareholder of real estate investment trust Soilbuild Business Space Reit on Jan 29 following the purchase of 4.06 million units at 75.7 cents each. The trade increased its direct holdings by 11 per cent to 40.229 million units or 5 per cent. The initial filing was made on the back of the 9 per cent rebound in the unit price since August 2013 from 69.5 cents. The initial filing price was slightly lower than the IPO price in August 2013 of 78 cents.\n\nInvestors should note that Schroders plc reported a purchase-related filing on Oct 23, 2013, of 1.27 million units at 76 cents each, which boosted its deemed stake to 80.402 million units or 10.01 per cent. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing on Sept 9, 2013, of 747,000 units at 72.5 cents each and a purchase-related filing on Aug 22, 2013, of 3.52 million units at 71 cents each.\n\nThe group became a substantial shareholder on Aug 16, 2013, after it acquired an initial 58.738 million units or 7.31 per cent in the IPO at 78 cents each. Overall, Schroders's stake is up 37 per cent since the IPO. The unit trust closed at 75 cents on Thursday.\n\nCroesus Retail Trust\n\nDBS Group Holdings turned negative in retail business trust Croesus Retail Trust after increasing its position on Dec 31, 2013, with a disposal-related filing on Jan 23 of 299,000 units at 87.6 cents each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 25.378 million units or 5.94 per cent.\n\nThe group previously reported a purchase-related filing on Dec 31, 2013, of 300,000 units at 88.5 cents each. Prior to that acquisition, the group unloaded 12.84 million units from May 28 to Nov 27, 2013, at $1.07 to $0.86 each and a disposal-related filing on May 27, 2013, of 394,000 units at $1.07 each.

DBS Group became a substantial shareholder on May 10, 2013, after it acquired an initial 34.929 million units or 8.21 per cent of the issued capital via placement at 93.8 cents each. Investors should note that AR Capital Pte Ltd unloaded 1.286 million units on Nov 28, 2013, at 87.9 cents each, which lowered its deemed stake to 28.757 million units or 6.73 per cent.\n\nThe group previously sold 3.576 million units from Oct 14 to 16, 2013, at an average of 86 cents each.

The average London home will cost about \u00a3600,000 (S$1.2 million) by 2018, it estimates. It is around \u00a3404,000 now, according to the Land Registry.\n\nPrices across most of the UK \"remain well below their pre-crisis peaks, and there seems little danger of a bubble\", Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said in the report.\n\n\"But London, which is suffering from a combination of strong demand and a lack of supply, is increasingly giving us cause for concern.\"\n\nSurging London home prices, buoyed by demand from overseas investors and government initiatives to aid buyers, have prompted economists, analysts and politicians to warn of unsustainable gains. Asia has been a particularly strong source of demand for the best London properties, EY Item Club said, citing brokers. Investors from countries such as China and Singapore are taking advantage of the pound's depreciation since the financial crisis to buy London homes.\n\nPeople living outside the UK bought half of all new homes sold in London's best neighbourhoods in the two years till June, broker Knight Frank LLP said in October.\n\nReducing the risk of a London property bubble could be difficult because values in prime districts have outperformed the city's peripheral areas, according to the EY Item Club report.

Such a move would face scrutiny by the European Commision, which has already forced WestLB out of business for asking its state owners for help too often.\n\n\"There is a lot of uncertainty how ship loans will be treated in the AQR and stress tests and how granular the approach will be regarding ship types and sizes, which perform extremely differently,\" the CEO of a major ship bank said.\n\nCredit rating agency Moody's pointed out that eight German banks have more than 100 billion euros (S$172 billion) of ship loans on their books, with one in five being seen as problem loans in 2012. Loss provisions will stay high in 2014, it predicted.\n\nMoody's said DZ Bank's DVB, HSH Nordbank, KfW IPEX Bank and NordLB were the most exposed to shipping sector stress.\n\nBut potential losses at DekaBank, Helaba, Commerzbank and Italy's Unicredit were small relative to their other banking activities and capital, Moody's said.\n\nThe shipping banks themselves are putting on a brave face, despite a nagging suspicion that the ECB will be severe.\n\n\"We will do fine in the asset quality review and stress test,\" Constantin von Oesterreich, chief executive of troubled German public-sector shipping lender HSH, said late last year.\n\nHis bank, Germany's largest ship financier, still holds 23 billion euros in ship loans, of which it believes one third is non-performing - meaning the loans have either been written down or the debtors are 90 days behind in servicing them.\n\nAltogether, HSH has made provisions of roughly three billion euros for its shipping portfolio.\n\nThe Hamburg-based bank expects to post a core tier-1 capital ratio of 10 per cent at the end of 2013 under Basel III capital adequacy rules, broadly in line with the 9.7 per cent posted by Deutsche Bank and ahead of Commerzbank, whose capital ratio stood at 8.6 per cent in the first nine months of 2013.\n\nExecutives at the ship banks say the auditors helping the ECB to carry out the asset quality review will employ the same criteria as those auditors who approved their accounts, minimising the risk of nasty surprises.\n\n\"Their assumptions on issues like future freight rates or ship values will have to be according to current accounting standards, so differences will not be huge,\" the CEO of a large German ship bank said.\n\nBut the ECB has lots of variables to play with, not least of which is the prospect for improvement in the sector. Some bankers say an upturn is at hand, whereas Moody's argues the current crisis could take up to 10 years to resolve.\n\nSuch contrasting views of the industry outlook could lead to conflicting assumptions of which loans are at risk.\n\nCarsten Wiebers, head of ship financing at KfW Ipex, said easy credit was spurring more building of large, efficient ships that deprive older vessels of profitable employment.\n\n\"As long as money is cheap, nothing in that will change,\" Mr Wiebers said of the intense competition in the sector.\n\nEven small changes to the ECB's parameters for loss assumptions could make a big difference for banks with large portfolios, S&P analyst Harm Semder said. \"If the outcome of the AQR is that the bank is potentially under-reserved, we do believe that this would require immediate action by the banks or their owners.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

It offers 400 per cent tax deductions and cash payouts to businesses that spend on productivity-related investments, including staff training, automation, and research and development.\n\nBut results of the government's push for productivity have thus far been described by some as \"lacklustre\" and \"scant\".\n\nThe numbers seem to bear this out. According to the Department of Statistics, labour productivity edged up by only 1.3 per cent in 2011, and even shrank by 2.6 per cent the year after - a far cry from the government's target to achieve productivity growth of 2-3 per cent per year by 2020.\n\nWhen queried by Parliament's Estimates Committee on the reasons for the decline, the Ministry of Finance said that Singapore's short-term productivity performance was largely reflective of economic cycles. It added that productivity declined 2.6 per cent in 2012 due to weaker economic growth, especially in the trade-oriented manufacturing sector, which was weighed down by the patchy recovery in advanced economies.\n\nIndeed, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam recently called economic restructuring \"a multi-year task\" and \"not something that can be achieved in two or three years\".\n\nBut apart from pallid productivity growth numbers, others have questioned the success of PIC in terms of its take-up rate, particularly among smaller firms which arguably need to improve most.\n\nWhile the take-up rate in 2012 was highest among large firms with a turnover of $100 million and above (81 per cent), it was lowest for micro-enterprises with a turnover of less than $1 million (24 per cent).\n\nSmall firms with revenue between $1 million and $10 million had a take-up rate of 59 per cent, while that of medium-sized businesses with turnover above $10 million but below $100 million stood at 74 per cent.\n\n\"While the PIC is structured to appeal most to SMEs, it benefits all companies - big and small,\" noted EY's Tan Bin Eng and Tracy Tham, partner and senior manager respectively of the firm's Business Incentives Advisory.\n\nBut with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) forming the backbone of Singapore's economy - they make up 99 per cent of all businesses here, hire 70 per cent of the labour force, and contribute almost half of GDP - there is concern that PIC resources aren't being channelled to businesses that are truly in need of assistance.\n\nSaid DBS economist Irvin Seah: \"The take-up rate of the PIC for smaller companies is exceptionally low compared to the bigger ones ... It could be reflecting that things are too onerous for the smaller guys. They need just as much, if not more help from the government.\"\n\nAccording to various audit firms and business associations, smaller companies often have limited know-how and resource constraints, which can hamper intentions to apply for government incentives.\n\nThat is why the vast majority of stakeholders favour an extension of the PIC beyond its 2015 expiry, over the implementation of a brand new scheme (or worse, its termination).\n\nBut they also want the government to simplify its rules, since SMEs' efforts to comply with administrative procedures can sometimes mean disproportionately high costs, compared to the benefits enjoyed.\n\nWhile Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) chief executive Phillip Overmyer noted the government's good intentions in developing a suite of schemes to support SMEs, he highlighted that many have found it \"onerous and time-consuming\" to comb through those of most use.\n\n\"In some cases, SMEs are not even certain if they qualify for the schemes and tend to be put off by the complex application process,\" said Mr Overmyer.\n\nKPMG's head of tax, Tay Hong Beng, meanwhile, would like to see a more forgiving taxman: \"The tax administration of the PIC scheme can also be improved, providing more leeway for companies to voluntarily disclose and correct honest mistakes in claims made.\"\n\nThis is especially so for smaller firms, who traditionally have minimal exposure to tax incentives.\n\nThere are also those - a small minority - who want to see an end to business productivity incentives, since results have been sub-par. According to findings from a recent KPMG pre-budget survey, 3.2 per cent of respondents said the PIC scheme \"has not been useful\" and don't want it extended.\n\nPart of this stems from disgruntlement with fraudsters. According to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras), common abuses include inflating claims by issuing invoices with higher prices; creating false records; setting up shell companies to make multiple claims; and hiring phantom employees to meet the criteria where firms must have at least three workers to make their claims.\n\nIn addition to these outright abuses of the system, there are also concerns about legally-valid claims that go against the spirit of the PIC scheme.\n\nSaid CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"Some companies are just using the schemes to change old office computers for new ones, since taxpayers are forking out the money, rather than seriously looking at how new technology or work processes can help them do more with less. So one view is that maybe it's better (to withhold help entirely until they either) get the message (to restructure) or pack up. It's not a bad strategy since there are still plenty of businesses who are willing to expand or start up here.\"\n\nBut UOB economist Francis Tan thinks that Singapore cannot afford the \"chain reaction\" that could hit the economy if that were to happen: \"Some might say we should force out the companies who can't restructure altogether, but I don't think that's a viable option. If the government is taking away companies' cheap labour - which they've been used to for so many years - it also needs to support and ease them into the new way of doing things.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On average, freight cargoes to and from Europe will grow 4 per cent a year through 2020, he added, citing Seabury Group forecasts.\n\nCarriers including World Airways Inc, Air Cargo Germany GmbH and Frontier Airlines were forced to fold, file for bankruptcy or cease freight flights last year as stuttering economic growth led to overcapacity. The glut was heightened by the arrival of new cargo planes and additional belly space in wide-body passenger jets entering service with Gulf operators.\n\n\"We saw the biggest consolidation since I've been in this industry,\" Mr Otto said at the event. \"The key question is which carriers will even offer freighter services going forward?\"\n\nLufthansa's cargo business, which had an operating profit of 43 million euros (S$74 million) in the first nine months of 2013, ended the year with a profit in the \"high double-digit million euro range\", Mr Otto reiterated. The Cologne-based company had earlier aimed to grow earnings at the unit, which now faces a third straight annual profit decline.\n\nThe tough market means Lufthansa's goal of posting a record cargo profit by 2015 may be hard to reach. The carrier had an all-time high 310 million-euro operating profit from freight operations in 2010, meaning it must more than triple the unspecified 2013 figure to meet its target. Asked if Lufthansa stands by the goal, Mr Otto said: \"That you have to ask the CEO.\"\n\nStill, yields are improving as Lufthansa raised prices by 20 per cent at the end of 2013, with customers accepting about 13 per cent of the hike, and an upswing in space sold continued into January, he said. Lufthansa stock has gained 15 per cent this year, the most in the six-member Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index.\n\nThe cargo operations of Air France-KLM Group, Europe's biggest passenger carrier, lost 184 million euros in the nine months, while Singapore Airlines Ltd posted a loss of US$71 million in freight for the first six months of its fiscal year. Air France has said it will reduce the freighter fleet to 10 planes by 2015, a move Mr Otto reckons will weaken its product. \"That's not the critical mass needed for such an operation,\" the executive said of Air France-KLM's plans.\n\nLufthansa is retiring some of its Boeing Co MD-11s as it takes five new 777 freighters by 2015. The company has an option for another five of the wide-bodies it can exercise this year, Mr Otto said, adding that it wants to operate an all-777 fleet.\n\nFour-engine freighters such as Boeing's 747-8 jumbo aren't a reasonable proposition for Europe-based carriers with oil at more than US$80 a barrel, he said, while some of the younger three-engine MD-11s could fly for another 10 years.\n\nThough many cargo operators have struggled, Dubai-based Emirates jumped to first place globally in 2012, according to the International Air Transport Association. Emirates overtook Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Korean Air Lines Co, while Lufthansa remained in fourth spot.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is the development of carriers in the Middle East,\" Mr Otto said. \"That's our biggest threat.\"\n\nStill, competing against Emirates is healthier than vying with ailing rivals offering cut-price fees to survive, he explained.\n\nMr Otto said Lufthansa is seeking one or two cooperation partners from the cargo industry this year to share belly space on passenger planes and potentially also freighter capacity.\n\n\"We've announced that for quite some time, but this year we are pretty sure it will happen,\" he said, adding that taking over the management of belly capacity from other passenger airlines is also an option for growth.\n\nLufthansa's efficiency initiatives in cargo, which include the fleet revamp and changing administrative procedures to a digital platform, are progressing according to plan, Mr Otto noted.\n\n\"Half of our business is short-term, it happens ad hoc,\" he said. \"For that, going digital will be a game changer.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

He said he would use the cash to reimburse victims and finance investigations. Governor Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, questioned AG Schneiderman's hold on the money and a dispute over the cash ensued.\n\nCalifornia Attorney-General Kamala Harris, seen by some as a potential gubernatorial candidate in 2018, used her US$300 million share from JPMorgan to reimburse public-pension funds for losses on mortgage investments.\n\nLisa Madigan, her Democratic counterpart in Illinois who considered a run for governor this year, applied her US$100 million share to the state's pension systems, which are facing a worst-in-the-nation US$100 billion shortfall. She trumpeted her move with a news release.\n\n\"Politics is all about money and power,\" said Peter Henning, a former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a professor at Wayne State University Law School who has written about the JPMorgan settlement. \"AG stands for 'almost governor'.\"\n\nLast November, the US and five state attorneys- general reached an agreement with the bank that it would pay US$13 billion to settle claims that it sold risky mortgage securities.\n\nJPMorgan, admitting that it and companies it bought hadn't sufficiently informed investors about risks, paid a US$2 billion civil penalty. It also paid almost US$6 billion to resolve lawsuits by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nNew York got US$613 million to settle a 2012 case that Mr Schneiderman mounted against the bank and its Bear Stearns unit. As the most active in pursuing - and suing - the bank, he won the biggest pot. That was enough to aggravate natural tensions with the state's top political figure.\n\n\"When the settlement gets big enough, you have a fight,\" said James Tierney, a former Maine attorney- general who runs a programme about the position in Columbia University's law course. \"Both bring to the table the legitimate functions of their office.\"\n\nThe stakes were heightened by another reality: the past two governors, Mr Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer, were elected after taking on Wall Street institutions as attorneys-general.\n\n\"It's counterintuitive, but the chance for sparks to fly is greater when the governor and attorney-general are from the same party,\" said former New York attorney-general Bob Abrams, who is now a partner with Stroock LLP in New York. \"There is a natural suspicion and paranoia, and there can be competing ambitions.\"\n\nSuch rivalries have been going on for decades, said Mr Tierney, a key adviser in the US$246 billion settlement among the tobacco industry, the US government and 46 attorneys-general in 1998.\n\nIn the 15 years since, governors have used the money for bridges, tax relief and other purposes not related to tobacco control or health that the attorneys-general had proposed.\n\nStates have received US$116 billion in payments and spent only 7.7 per cent on tobacco prevention programmes, said Peter Fisher, vice-president for state issues at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\n\"A lot of public officials at the time made some grandiose promises about spending the money on tobacco prevention and health,\" Mr Fisher said. \"The reality turned out to be quite different.\"\n\nIn later deals, the attorneys-general protected their plans.\n\nIn February 2012, the US and 49 attorneys-general reached a US$25 billion settlement with five top mortgage servicers, including Bank of America Corp, whom they accused of signing foreclosure documents without verifying them.\n\nThe servicers were told to use as much as US$21.5 billion to cut homeowners' principal payments, refinance loans at lower rates and compensate 2 million people who lost their homes because of malfeasance. Money going directly to the states would protect consumers against foreclosures.\n\nMr Schneiderman structured New York's share of the JPMorgan agreement to give his office broad powers to determine how the funds would be spent, according to the settlement.\n\nThe original deal gave Mr Schneiderman control of 85 per cent, with 15 per cent going to the state treasury. It said he could use the funds to aid those hurt by the foreclosure crisis and \"otherwise promote the interests of the investing public\".\n\nHe could spend money on housing counsellors, mediation, and anti-blight projects, the settlement said.\n\nMr Cuomo balked and argued with Mr Schneiderman that the money was meant to relieve all taxpayers, and the attorney-general wasn't allowed under state law to spend it as he saw fit, according to an administration official familiar with the discussions who requested anonymity because the dispute was private.\n\nMr Schneiderman and Mr Cuomo worked out the dispute over the first US$163 million instalment of the four-year payout just before the governor announced his state budget on Jan 21. The attorney- general will put half into the treasury, and Mr Cuomo and the legislature will spend it on housing. Mr Schneiderman also agreed to go through the state contracting process and the oversight that comes with it when spending the funds.\n\nMatt Mittenthal, a Schneiderman spokesman, said the deal was a \"product of positive negotiations\".\n\nThree other payouts will follow, leaving Mr Schneiderman with hundreds of millions to disburse in remaining years. Mr Cuomo expects to fight over the division of each, said another aide who requested anonymity because the matter is private.\n\nMr Tierney said the conflict between attorneys-general and governors can make for good government.\n\n\"Most states want the friction between the two,\" he said. \"They want the AG to stand up to the governor, because it's a check on the governor's power.\"\n\nThe case is People of the State of New York v JPMorgan Securities, 451556- 2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/asian-firms-tap-public-cloud-more-vital-systems", "site_title": "Asian firms tap public cloud more for vital systems", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAsian firms tap public cloud more for vital systems\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDRIVEN by the need for greater cost and time efficiency, financial institutions and large enterprises in Asia are starting to tap the public cloud for mission-critical systems, says Michael Kiss, senior consultant with Verizon Enterprise Solutions.\n\nSuch systems, which include enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) systems, are critical to an organisation as any failure or interruption can significantly impact business operations.\n\nVerizon is already hosting mission-critical systems on the cloud for financial organisations. For instance, it helped a bank move one of its ERP systems to the public cloud, cutting down the cost by half and reducing the time taken for a technology refresh from an estimated 14 months to a mere three months. Although the bank is headquartered in the United States, the decision to leverage the public cloud for the globally used system was taken in Asia. The implementation was carried out in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n\"Asia, compared to the US, tends to be a little slower in terms of newer technologies. But this demonstrates where the focus is shifting for this market. It's a really exciting sign of what is coming for the industry here by and large,\" said Mr Kiss.\n\nHe added: \"They don't have to worry about asset depreciation or managing so much infrastructure. Keeping their technology current was effectively built into our cost, so they were able to concentrate more on the business functions and what they were delivering. If anything, we are going to see a further acceleration of this sort of technology not just in financial institutions but large companies in general.\"\n\nOther customers in Asia that have taken a similar route include Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels (HSH) Ltd, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts and those in the energy and manufacturing sectors.\n\nClement Teo, senior analyst with Forrester Research Inc, notes, however, that it is still early days, as the public cloud is typically used for test and development purposes, as well as for lower-priority applications.\n\nGiving customers the extra confidence to go beyond such traditional usage is Verizon's unique guarantee of 100 per cent uptime that covers facilities, platform and operating system. So networking, storage or power can also be taken offline during maintenance without interrupting services. Many companies with performance-sensitive applications typically look for a provider that can guarantee at least four nines of availability or 99.99 per cent. This works out to a downtime of 52.56 minutes a year or 4.32 minutes a month.\n\nAccording to Mr Kiss, Verizon's offering is possible due to its more stringent build process, which allows it to verify that the cloud resources are functioning as they should. \"Many providers will do snapshots of virtual machines. But when you do that, there are certain checks and balances that you can't put in place unless you are provisioning a host from scratch,\" he explained. While there are providers that can offer such a high level of availability, these are only for certain components, he said.\n\nThe availability period is calculated on a monthly basis. This means that if the guarantee is not met for a particular month, compensation is calculated for that month. Verizon is looking to make such a calculation available on a daily basis to give customers that use the cloud for just days in a month a granular measurement of what is happening in their environment.\n\nOn the public cloud, there are inevitably noisy neighbours - applications that put large demands on the server, storage, database or network, negatively impacting the performance of other vital applications.\n\nTo overcome this problem, Verizon adds new resources to the cloud when utilisation reaches 70 per cent, instead of the 90 per cent threshold used by some providers, said Mr Kiss. Users can also opt for dedicated cloud resources for heavy workloads.\n\nAlthough Verizon's cloud services were launched in Asia in 2009, it is only in the last two years in which it has seen a good take-up rate, driven mainly by a better understanding of the cloud and by customers requiring a technology refresh. John Hines, Verizon's area vice-president for South Asia and India, expects the cloud to drive 30 per cent of its business in Asia in the next 18-24 months.\n\nAs cloud adoption grows, Mr Kiss sees the IT department becoming less of a gatekeeper and more of a broker of IT services. In the IDC Asia/Pacific C-suite Barometer 2013 research, it was found that more than one-fifth of CMOs (chief marketing officers) have direct IT budget and procurement authority in their organisations. However, Mr Kiss noted that splitting the marketing budget to run short-term initiatives on the cloud has worked well for Verizon's customers.\n\n\"We work with customers where we have almost two separate technology streams. We have the CIO/CFO stream handling all business services, delivering internally to their customers; and we have the CMO stream, where they're focused on marketing initiatives that are run for short periods of time.\n\n\"Rather than draw the cloud-based marketing expenditure out of the main IT budget, it is easier for them to split their financial model - this gives the marketing team the autonomy to work within their requirements yet the core systems are still handled from where they need to be handled, from a budgeting perspective too.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With these, 70 new staff positions have been added, most of them aimed at strengthening SPH's digital capabilities.\n\nAs a result of the restructuring process, about 230 positions have effectively been removed from the newspapers and magazines SPH publishes, representing a 6 per cent reduction. Only 10 employees will be laid off; they will be offered retrenchment packages.\n\nMr Chan wrote: \"With our core print business still facing headwinds, we must succeed in our transition into the digital space. While we do this, we will also be open to opportunities in other areas of business.\"\n\nLast October, SPH announced the set-up of a $100 million New Media Fund, which will look to invest in related businesses. SPH is now recruiting a chief executive for this fund, Mr Chan said.\n\nSPH has also made two recent investments. One is in Magzter Inc, a self-service digital magazine store with a global catalogue of magazines; the other is Facon Education Fair, one of the largest education fairs in Malaysia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But if they meet one of three criteria - present unprecedented issues such as a new jurisdiction, sector or having unusual features or structures; require specialised expertise; or involve matters of public interests such as high profile cases - they would go before the independent committee.\n\nThe composition of the independent listing committee will be critical, said Rachel Eng, joint managing partner of WongPartnership.\n\n\"The process is already quite stringent, so I doubt they will add another similar layer as it wouldn't help,\" she said. \"I think they should look for people who can add value.\"\n\nThis includes those with expertise in certain sectors or countries.\n\nCompared to the past, when companies that listed were typically manufacturers, \"nowadays with globalisation and new products and services, you're coming up with new business models or new types of business\", Ms Eng added. \"It is not as straightforward as before.\"\n\nThe diversity of the committee will also be important, said UBS's Ms Choo.\n\n\"Having the independent listing committee is good. But some careful consideration needs to go into who is going to be on this listing committee,\" she said. \"It would be constructive to ensure a diversity of views incorporating international best practices, whether from foreign banks or law firms, given the increasing globality of listings.\"\n\nIndustry observers do not expect the time to market for initial public offerings to be affected, nor procedures for listings to be made more onerous as a result of the independent committee.\n\nHong Kong, which has a similar approach, \"has attracted a wide range of IPO candidates over the recent years, and their number is still growing\", noted RHTLaw Taylor Wessing managing partner Tan Chong Huat. \"It is unlikely that the independent listing committee will make it more onerous for new listings and make SGX less attractive.\"\n\nThe proposed changes will, in fact, put SGX closer in its regulatory practice to markets such as the United States, where an external regulator, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, reviews listing applications, noted Shook Lin & Bok partner Robson Lee. \"(These) will better augment the current practice of the SGX.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We may have to do a couple of minutes in front, a couple of minutes behind, just to cater for aircraft departures.\"\n\nCommercial flights are typically halted during the flying display segment so as to give the aircraft access to airspace.\n\nLast year, Changi Airport handled a record 53.7 million passengers and 343,800 landings and take-offs, representing year-on-year increases of 5 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively.\n\nStill, Experia Events has beefed up the flight time of the flying displays by a total of 30 minutes over the course of this week.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, when the Singapore Airshow is open to the public, visitors will also be able to enter the gates an hour earlier this year so as to catch the aerobatic displays at 10.25am. 45,000 of the 80,000 public tickets have been sold so far.\n\nBut even as the Singapore Airshow grows from strength to strength, it will first have to take into account how future plans to boost Changi's capacity - which include a third runway and the upcoming Terminal 5 - will affect access to the Changi Exhibition Centre before it considers any expansion plans.\n\n\"Before we can increase any of the infrastructure, we have to look at the road accessibility. When (Aviation Park Road) is going to be used during the construction period, we're going to have to find a different route in, or we're going to have to share,\" he said, stressing that he will have to take a look at the masterplan once it is ready. \"We're working on several scenarios.\"\n\nThe biennial Singapore Airshow has been growing in scale over the years, with over 1,000 exhibitors set to attend the 2014 edition - up about 10 per cent from 2012 - while the number of aircraft in the static display area has risen from 72 in 2012 to over 90 commercial, business and military aircraft.\n\n\"We're limited a little bit by space,\" said Mr Lau, adding that the organisers have had to turn down a couple of aircraft that could not be accommodated, such as the Airbus A380 double-decker jumbo. Instead, Airbus will display its new A350 aircraft.\n\nOf the various countries participating at Singapore Airshow 2014, Japan has increased its presence, while Malaysia and Hong Kong will have national pavilions for the first time. There are about 22 country pavilions in all this year.\n\nWith the aerospace industry growing continously, planemakers, such as Boeing and Airbus, as well as aerospace component manufacturers are showing strong interest in component suppliers in the region.\n\n\"This creates an opportunity for Japanese small-and-medium enterprises and business consortiums to venture into the aerospace manufacturing industry in South-east Asia,\" Masaya Hasebe, managing director of Japan's trade and investment agency Jetro (Singapore) said.\n\nThere are 42 companies and six organisations from Japan participating at the Singapore Airshow this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Specifically, about 0.3 percentage-points of productivity growth was lost each year on average in the last five years, as a result of the increase in employment share of the construction sector,\" said Mr Goh in his report, released yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Total iron ore exports were 28.2 million tonnes from a record 29.5 million tonnes in December and 22.1 million tonnes a year earlier, the data showed.\n\nSteelmakers in the world's second biggest economy purchased a record amount of ore in 2013 even as growth slowed.\n\nThe global ore market remains undersupplied and will shift to a modest surplus only in the second half, according to Morgan Stanley. Prices, which fell last month, may decline further as supply expands, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n\"It's down month-on-month, which reflects seasonal weakness with winter in China and some wet-season issues in the Pilbara,\" said Tom Price, an analyst at UBS AG in Sydney.\n\nExports rose \"year-on-year because we just had a whole bunch of projects come into the market in 2013, mostly the second half, by Rio and Fortescue. The whole trade flow has expanded but it still has the seasonal character built into it.\"\n\nFortescue Metals Group Ltd, Australia's third-largest iron ore exporter, is boosting capacity to 155 million tonnes by the end of March. The Pilbara is the country's principal ore-producing region.\n\nRio Tinto Group, the world's second largest mining company, said last month that production rose 7 per cent to 55.5 million tonnes last quarter from 52 million tonnes a year earlier.

As a result, the 2012-2013 growth, revised to 4.5 per cent from 5 per cent last week, was at a decade's low. In the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, growth is expected to be around 4.8 per cent. The government is using various fiscal policy instruments to tame inflation and kick-start stalled investment projects. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 25-basis-point hike in the benchmark repo rate, at which it lends to commercial banks, to 8 per cent. The cash reserve ratio - the amount banks must keep in hand to withstand financial shocks - was left unchanged at 4 per cent.\n\nMost analysts expected the central bank to hold the rate steady, considering that the key Wholesale Price Index came down in December to 6.16 per cent year on year from 7.52 per cent in November. RBI governor Raghuram Rajan justified the hike by saying that the rollback of the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing posed significant risks and hence there's a need to address this in \"order to stabilise and anchor inflation expectations\". The RBI's decision was criticised by both the industry and analysts, who were of the opinion that the hike would delay economic recovery by making loans more costly. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) advocated a shift to an accommodative monetary policy stance, sooner rather than later.\n\nHowever, the plain-speaking Mr Rajan told industry that he did not have any \"magic wand\" to lower borrowing costs. He noted that, rather than concentrate on the lending rate, what was needed was the revival of stalled projects, calling that the \"first priority\". The critical need was to get investment back as once that came, the rest would follow, he added. The governor has a valid point. While inflation has been a major problem, there has also been a steep decline in investment. For example, from 2005 to 2008, the economy grew at an average rate of 8-9 per cent. The gross fixed capital formation rate, a measure of the accumulation of fixed assets by business, government and households, was 32.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007-2008. In 2011-2012, this came down to 30.6 per cent, with the corporate sector showing the steepest decline.\n\nThis indicates that due to uncertain economic headwinds and also policy confusion, private sector investment in new factories and assets has declined dramatically. Corporate investment as a percentage of GDP has dropped from 17 per cent to 10 per cent, according to the RBI governor. In this context, as Mr Rajan, noted, the work of the Cabinet Committee on Investments has been noteworthy. It has begun to fast-track a number of stalled projects which, hopefully, would bring the economy back on track. \"I am seeing the beginnings of a revival in large projects that were stalled. . . That, to my mind, is very heartening,\" Mr Rajan was quoted as saying.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Against the year-ago value of $929.3 billion, however, the size of the Singapore market declined 3.7 per cent.\n\nThe growth came mostly from the larger stocks. The combined market cap of the top 10 per cent of stocks by market value grew by 2.9 per cent over the month, compared with a 3 per cent reduction for the smallest 10 per cent of stocks.\n\nPrice indices reflected those numbers. The blue chip-dominated Straits Times Index (STI) gained 2.7 per cent in February to close at 3,110.78 yesterday. Almost all the STI component stocks grew over the month.\n\nThe largest increase among STI stocks came from commodity trader Olam International, whose market cap grew 19.9 per cent to $4.3 billion. At the other end, container port business trust Hutchison Port Holding Trust, which trades in US dollars, shrank 6.5 per cent to a market value of $6.9 billion.\n\nThe largest overall growth came from construction company Swee Hong, which saw its stock jump 38 per cent on Feb 24. Responding to a query by Singapore Exchange, Swee Hong said it was not aware of any undisclosed information that might explain the trading. The company had earlier posted a larger net loss of $5.4 million for the second fiscal quarter ended December. Its year-ago net loss was $2 million. Swee Hong's market cap almost doubled in February to $86.6 million.\n\nThe billion-dollar club added one member in February to total 112. The combined market value of companies with market cap of $1 billion or more was $764.8 billion, or about 87.6 per cent of the total market value.\n\nTelco giant Singapore Telecommunications remained the largest stock in Singapore, with a market cap of $57.4 billion. The smallest stock, Junma Tyre Cord Co, which makes and sells chemical fibre and materials, saw its market cap stay largely flat at $1.2 million.\n\nThere were no initial public offerings during the period.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But as an economist, you become most bullish when the story and the data align with each other - which is what is happening right now.\"\n\nThat story is based on a confluence of factors, with the \"most crucial\" being the repairment of balance sheets across banks, corporates and households.\n\nIn particular, Mr Harris pointed out how the household debt service ratio, an estimate of the share of debt payments to disposable personal income, has fallen to 10 per cent - the lowest it has been in 30 years.\n\nThis, and better-than-expected economic data - in manufacturing, retail sales, and exports; and more broad-based growth in Q4 GDP - have further stoked hopes of a long-awaited US recovery. Said Mr Harris: \"These are all hints (which tell you that) the economy is in a healthier position, and the turn could be coming at any time . . . Other factors - like the end of fiscal tightening and the quiet in Washington - tell you that this is about the right time for it to happen.\"\n\nHe expects US GDP growth to be 3 per cent this year, a significant improvement over the sluggish 2 per cent average seen for the last four-and-a-half years. \"I could see growth as high as 4 per cent in 2014. I think the risks are much more to the upside than to the downside (and again) it's because (there has been) so much improvement in balance sheets.\n\n\"I think to get weaker growth, something has to go wrong. There has to be a Middle East crisis, or the Fed does a very poor job of exiting, or China has a hard landing,\" he added.\n\nThe average American will also start to feel the effects of an economic recovery this year, thanks to a more flexible job market with higher turnover rates.\n\nWith heightened business confidence, hiring intentions should pick up as well, with job gains estimated to be in the 200,000-250,000 range on a monthly basis. Therefore, job seekers will start to feel \"a little less desperate\" this year.\n\nWhile more sanguine economic conditions in the US will provide \"a modest engine of growth\" for the global economy, Mr Harris also warned of pockets in emerging markets - such as Indonesia, India, Brazil and Turkey - that will be highly sensitive to higher interest rates. \"The countries that are most vulnerable are the ones that are having political issues, simultaneous with bad trade balance, and bad government financing . . . They're going (to experience) some pressure,\" he noted. \"From the point of view of both emerging markets and the US capital market, the key here is low US inflation - that's even more important than US growth. Low US inflation is what gets you the friendly Fed that really does not want to hurt markets.\"\n\nEven so, he believes that the chances of this happening in the near-term are \"very low\": \"We still have plenty of unemployment, and it's still against a global backdrop of declining inflation. (With each year) the risk gets a bit higher, so by 2015 we'll start to actually worry about (higher inflation) . . . But it's a low risk in 2014.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SingLand recorded a 73 per cent increase in revenue from Pan Pacific hotel to $113.5 million.\n\nBoth UIC and SingLand also got a lift from the residential project Archipelago, each recording a $19.5 million share of results from the project.\n\nFair value gain on investment properties saw a dip, with UIC marking a 21 per cent fall to $196 million and SingLand recording a 4 per cent drop to $158.2 million, based on independent valuations as at Dec 31.\n\nBoth companies expressed caution for the office leasing, hotel and residential sectors.\n\n\"The office leasing market is not expected to improve to any great extent in the short to medium term,\" UIC said. \"The hotel sector will continue to face challenges from new hotel room supply, manpower restriction and rising operating cost.\n\n\"Market sentiments for residential property would remain cautious with the continuing government property cooling measures.\"\n\nBut both companies noted that even with the projected increase in retail space, the retail rental market is expected to remain stable on the back of strong demand, healthy visitor arrivals and interest from international fast-fashion retail brands.\n\nUIC and SingLand have proposed a first and final dividend of 3 cents per share and 20 cents per share, respectively.\n\nTrading of shares in UIC and SingLand have been halted since Thursday. Both companies requested for the immediate trading halt \"pending the release of an announcement\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They expire on March 31. The next month may very well see consumer spending across the island tick up as others like me, who have procrastinated spending the vouchers till the last moment, rush to cash in.\n\nI will probably end up spending them at NTUC to buy some necessities like shampoo, washing powder or vegetables and fruit. But I am also tempted to use the vouchers to eat out at a restaurant - something I don't usually do because I find it too expensive. But by having a fixed amount to spend, I am encouraged to do so regardless of the value I perceive from the meal.\n\nWhen we speak about budgeting, we usually talk about setting a fixed amount to spend every day, week or month. But sometimes, knowing this amount can have perverse consequences. Instead of spending only when they need to, people willingly spend to their self-set limits, spending more than they otherwise would.\n\nIn an experiment three years ago, financial advice software provider HelloWallet sent users a personalised email on Friday evenings alerting them to how much they can safely spend over the weekend. The idea is that when people go out on Saturday and Sunday, they blow their salary on things they shouldn't, and if they are reminded of their budget, they won't do so.\n\nThe experiment backfired. \"What we found is that we systematically increased spending on the weekend; it had the opposite effect because we were basically giving people permission to spend,\" HelloWallet CEO Matt Fellowes told Bloomberg in a recent interview.\n\nAnd herein lies the lesson for employers, policymakers and individuals trying to achieve cost savings through budgeting: having the right incentives is critical. Good ideas in theory can have unintended consequences in practice.\n\nWhere personal finance is concerned, setting a strict amount to spend every day might not be helpful for real life, when spending fluctuates depending on one's circumstances. If a close friend gets married and you didn't budget for the hongbao, for example, you may very well fail to hit your savings goals for the month. Yet, giving the hongbao is necessary.\n\nWhat might instead work better is to focus on the question of \"why am I spending\" instead of \"how much should I spend\".\n\nOne can understand one's spending habits by tracking expenses closely, and thinking about whether these expenses are truly necessary.\n\nAnother important question to ask is \"what am I saving for\". Achieve clarity on these goals, and you can gain power over your finances. To all readers, Gong Xi Fa Cai!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The offering had been subscribed about 2.68 times. The counter last traded at $1.33 last Thursday, just before the markets closed for the Chinese New Year break.\n\n\"In my humble opinion, moving the company to SGX will be the most positive and profound action we've taken as a company since we originally listed in Australia in 2006,\" Mr Bond said in a recent interview with The Business Times.\n\nBrisbane-based Linc recorded revenue of A$124 million (S$138 million) for the financial year ended June 30, 2013, with gross profit more than doubling to A$65 million. It counts the investment arm of Kuala Lumpur-listed Genting as a cornerstone investor.\n\nMr Bond cites several reasons for the decision to delist in his home country and launch a mainboard initial public offering on the Singapore bourse.\n\nWith Linc's underground coal gasification (UCG) business starting to develop in Asia, Mr Bond believes that the value of the company and its share price will grow in tandem over time as well.\n\n\"Asia is a significant growth region for energy, and we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of that. Singapore is an energy hub and is a natural place to drive that growth,\" he says.\n\nHis enthusiasm about UCG, a type of coal conversion technology, is evident. UCG converts deep stranded coal to a gas, which can then be used for cleaner power generation and liquid fuel production.\n\nLinc has invested A$210 million in developing its UCG technology in the past nine years.\n\n\"Our emerging UCG business . . . allows us to unlock huge volumes of gas from deep stranded coal reserves. Asia has literally hundreds of these stranded coal opportunities that Linc can exploit,\" he says.\n\nFor now, Mr Bond - who this October will mark a decade on the Linc board - is busy building up his company's presence in this part of the world.\n\nLinc is setting up its Asia headquarters in Singapore at the 43-storey Ocean Financial Centre in Collyer Quay. On top of that, there are plans to open site offices in Indonesia, Vietnam, China and Mongolia soon.\n\nWhen asked what keeps him motivated all these years, Mr Bond remarks that the global energy business is one that \"keeps the world moving and progressing\".\n\n\"All significant economic growth is driven via cost-effective and easily available energy. When you take that statement and overlay it on top of an Asian growth story, then you can see why the energy industry is exciting,\" he says.\n\nMr Bond enjoys spending what precious free time he has with his wife Louise and their six children. \"The demands on most CEOs and entrepreneurs mean you are constantly trying to balance your responsibilities with your family. In terms of what 'family' means to me, it is, in a word, everything. They are why I do what I do,\" he says.\n\nWork demands\n\nAnd apart from snapping up planes for his collection - he is currently rebuilding a 1944 World War 2 Spitfire - he also enjoys piloting them himself. He first learnt to fly a plane at Brisbane's Camden Airport about 17 years ago, which is how his eldest son, Adam, picked it up.\n\nFamily, planes and hobbies apart, it looks like Mr Bond will be grounded by the demands of work. \"The reality is, I work or travel most of the time. So I have little chance to partake in these hobbies. And with Linc Energy growing so fast, I doubt I will have too much time to do so in the future,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We strongly believe that through innovation, we can differentiate ourselves at two levels: by providing value to the business and to the company overall, and by giving value to the staff,\" he told BT in a recent interview.\n\nIn his view, no idea is too big or too small - something which he communicates regularly to the bank's employees.\n\nSince OCBC rolled out an innovation portal nearly three years ago for staff to chip in with their suggestions, more than 5,000 ideas have flowed in.\n\nMany of them have gone on to be realised, said Mr Raina, even simple ones such as providing umbrellas in the office lobbies for shared use or having a daily shuttle service to ferry staff from one office to another.\n\n\"Staff at all levels are encouraged to become innovative thinkers who actively seek ways to improve their workplace and the way we serve customers by thinking out of the box, challenging the status quo, being resourceful and being unafraid to embrace change,\" Mr Raina said.\n\nHe hopes that the innovation lab will continue to produce new initiatives that will benefit all stakeholders.\n\nOn occasion, members of the senior management, including the CEO, drop by to listen to presentations by employees who have come up with ways to help boost productivity or morale at the workplace.\n\nMr Raina said: \"It's very important to have the support of the top management. The staff can feel it when the division head or CEO walks in and asks to see what's new.\n\n\"The staff gets the chance to show off their ideas to top management directly, and that's a big reward in itself - much bigger than any monetary reward.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

StarHub has signed on a second chat app partnership, this time with Japan's Line, on an exclusive basis for its pre-paid customers.\n\nFrom Feb 15, StarHub's pre-paid mobile users will gain access to Line plans for either 40 cents a day or $6 for 30 days.\n\n\"Singapore's mobile pre-paid market has much room for further growth, especially in mobile data use,\" said Chan Kin Hung, head of mobility at StarHub.\n\n\"We believe our Line plan will be well received by customers, as they increasingly rely on fun, innovative social messaging services and stay online for longer.\"\n\nTo date, the pattern of telco-app pre-paid tie-ups has conformed to the local pecking order of telcos. Rival SingTel, the grand dame of the telco sector, exclusively brought onboard the grandfather of chat apps, WhatsApp, last year. This year, SingTel continued on this trajectory by signing up Facebook, the most popular social networking site in Singapore, albeit on a non-exclusive basis for its pre-paid customers.\n\nStarHub, the second-largest telco here, also non-exclusively aligned itself with China's WeChat, arguably the world's second-largest chat app with 272 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q3 last year. The incumbent WhatsApp has more than 400 million MAUs.\n\nWhile StarHub's latest partner Line claims 340 million users, this is based on the number of registered users that it has, which is inevitably higher than the number of MAUs - a more stringent metric.\n\nM1, the smallest of the trio, has in turn partnered with relatively less well-known apps, such as music-streaming app Deezer and buffet app service All You Can App. So far, it is the only telco without a tie-up with a chat app.\n\nThe motivation for all three telcos, however, remains the same, as they turn to data usage to shore up sliding revenue from voice calls and text messages.\n\nEven as consumers are increasingly reluctant to spend on the utilitarian services offered by telcos, they have been more receptive to the cuddlier elements offered by chat apps.\n\nLast year, for example, was a banner year for Line, which saw revenue climb from 5.85 billion yen (S$73.4 million) to 15.6 billion yen over the first three quarters, fuelled by in-game purchases and virtual sticker sales.\n\nNow, as telcos hitch their wagon to the rising star that is the mobile app in a bid to drive data monetisation, the proof of the pudding will be in the average revenue per user (ARPU) numbers.\n\nIt is early days yet, for the first app tie-up for the industry happened only in August with the SingTel-WhatsApp partnership. Over the course of this year, all three telcos' ARPU figures will reveal if this strategy of app alliances has paid off.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It seems that the government is in a haste to drive upgrades and not lose momentum in the productivity upgrading,\" said Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) president Kurt Wee.\n\nThere is reason to hurry, if the 2-3 per cent productivity growth a year target is to be met by 2020. Singapore's productivity has grown 11 per cent over the past four years, but this was entirely due to the strong cyclical recovery in 2010 with little improvement since.\n\n\"However, the fear is that you might choke off a segment of the industry - the weaker ones that have not fully got onto the productivity bandwagon,\" Mr Wee said.\n\nMeasures unveiled by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam last Friday included a much sought after $3.6 billion, three-year extension of the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme and a PIC+ enhancement that raises SMEs' eligible expenditure for tax deduction by 50 per cent.\n\nOther goodies included $500 million worth of incentives to encourage adoption of infocomm technologies, $150 million for co-investments in equity and mezzanine funding, higher risk-sharing on micro-loans and better internationalisation incentives.\n\nThese went down well in the eyes of economists such as Citi's Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan. \"Besides bolstering cash flow, this multi-dimensional approach promotes both product and process innovation in laggard sectors,\" they said.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah, too, said: \"Appropriate and targeted assistance to companies will yield much better outcomes in the longer term than broad-based tightening in labour policies that undermines Singapore's competitiveness.\"\n\nThe only manpower-related blow this year was dealt to the construction sector - the sole sector to face a foreign worker levy hike in 2016. Keeping to the \"multi-dimensional\" approach, the government paired this levy hike with changes to allow skilled workers in the construction, marine and process sectors to work here for a longer maximum of 22 years, up from 18. Also, rules will be tightened to encourage developers to use manpower-saving designs, and give contractors reasons to upgrade their workers' skills.\n\nFor all other sectors, the last of levy and quota changes unveiled last year will be fully rolled out by July 2015. But fresh measures have not been ruled out.\n\n\"We will continue to closely monitor the growth of foreign manpower in other sectors, to ascertain whether further tightening measures, including levy increases, are needed for 2016 and beyond,\" Mr Tharman said on Friday.\n\nThis should sound a warning bell for less productive clusters. The construction sector has been the exception to the general slowdown in foreign workforce growth over the past two years, Mr Tharman pointed out.\n\nConstruction was also found to be one of the lowest contributors to productivity growth in the past five years, in a study published in the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Annual Economic Survey of Singapore last week.\n\nIts productivity level was below average, but it hired a rising proportion of Singapore's total workforce over the past five years partly due to stepped-up building and infrastructure projects, shaving about 0.3 percentage point off productivity growth each year in the past five years.\n\nAnother sector with a similar profile was the accommodation and food services sector. \"Stronger economy-wide productivity gains hinge on cutting employment share of laggard sectors, which is not assured,\" the Citi economists said.\n\nAnother thought that could give bosses pause is the government may still introduce off-Budget policies relating to foreign manpower. Last year, changes to the minimum qualifying salary for the bottom tier of employment passes, as well as the fair consideration framework that will mandate that firms attempt to hire Singaporean PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) before seeking foreigners, were announced after Budget season was long over.\n\nBut business observers think this is unlikely. Singapore Business Federation chief operating officer Victor Tay said: \"What has been set in motion is a schedule-based reduction. I doubt they will roll out measures in the interim, as it may disrupt business operations and project costings.\"\n\nMeasures taken to tighten the inflow of foreign PMETs \"are already quite comprehensive and align with the American and European standards\" and he doubts the government will go further.\n\nHowever, Mr Tay said that while this year's Budget has been more targeted - addressing growth-oriented companies and the financing issues of tech start-ups - it does not address the needs of those struggling because of restructuring.\n\n\"These are companies which have eroded margins or at survival brink are still finding it harder to obtain financing,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Singapore Business Federation's survey, a smaller proportion of SMEs benefit from government incentives compared with larger ones. They also tend to hire more mature workers, which means their wage bills may be disproportionately hit by the coming rise in CPF contribution rates.\n\n\"But that may be part of the philosophy behind the policy: not to put money into companies that are more likely to fail,\" said Mr Tay. After all, Mr Tharman himself said on Friday: \"We are not recycling monies indiscriminately, or seeking to benefit all firms equally. Our schemes will still favour the more dynamic and efficient players.\"\n\nASME's Mr Wee added: \"There is some risk. There is some signal that the government appears to be pushing for some level of consolidation in the economic scene at large.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/secular-shift-big-opportunity-oracle", "site_title": "Secular shift big opportunity for Oracle", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSecular shift big opportunity for Oracle\n\nThe company also say it is uniquely poised to help customers use big data to solve problems, reports AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Feb 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMARK Hurd, Oracle's co-president and director, is not very enamoured by catchy IT keywords - such as cloud, big data, IoT (Internet of Things) - that get most people excited.\n\nHe notes: \"If you run to the top of a building (in Singapore) and shout big data, it's interesting, but at the end of it, if you cannot bring it down to something that's easily understood, the customer doesn't know what to do with it. . . (Similarly), Cloud, cloud! A lot of companies think that if they scream cloud enough times then their stock prices would go up!\"\n\n\"What we as an industry need to do is quit using terms and start turning these things into meaningful use cases,\" he says.\n\nMr Hurd tells BizIT: \"I believe to the core that IT is hard. I believe having great IT is even harder. To achieve great IT you need to have strong leadership, not just at the CIO (chief information officer) level but also at the CEO level as well.\"\n\nMr Hurd notes that big data, at its core, are typically voluminous amounts of data that give insights at the granular or atomic level. This helps in formulating better decisions faster. And he thinks Oracle is uniquely poised to help customers use big data to solve problems.\n\n\"We have a customer in France which makes big aeroplanes. It takes them roughly a year from the time the plane comes off the assembly line for testing till it can be delivered to the customer.\n\n\"They typically fly these planes and test them. In some cases, it takes them five to six days to get the data from the tests, make changes and then send the plane back for more tests. For a big plane, there can be as many as 100,000 senors generating huge amounts of data.\n\n\"We (Oracle) have the capability to gather all of that data economically for the customer and analyse it and give timely results. Now you can imagine the opportunity that unfolds for the customer to take big data and turn it into more test flights and deliver the plane faster to the buyer.\"\n\nBig data is inexorably linked with cloud infrastructure as well as analytics, and this is why Mr Hurd feels Oracle is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the paradigm shift taking place in the IT industry.\n\nBookings for Oracle's SaaS (software-as-a-service) cloud applications grew 35 per cent last quarter, reflecting a continuously improving win rate versus the new generation of SaaS specialists.\n\n\"What's behind that growth? Certainly our products are good. But I think the secular shift in IT is helping us,\" he says. In SaaS, Oracle has a suite of applications including HR (human resources), financial, sales automation, and marketing.\n\nThe company has made a host of cloud-based acquisitions, including RightNow (CRM or customer relationship management software), Taleo (talent management software), Eloqua (marketing automation), Responsys (campaign management), Nimbula (infrastructure) and Corente (application delivery). Oracle has also introduced Oracle Fusion applications, designed for cloud delivery as well as on-premises deployment.\n\nMr Hurd notes that Oracle has fundamentally rewritten its applications for the cloud. \"We have ERP (enterprise resource planning) for the cloud today. And we are pushing it hard. We have a big opportunity to gain marketshare.\"\n\nAt the second-quarter earnings call in December, Larry Ellison, Oracle's CEO & director, noted that the company enters 2014 with refreshed versions of the key products that are expected to drive growth over the year. Oracle's latest database, version 12c was specifically designed for the cloud. He added that Oracle's Fusion cloud applications for HCM (human capital management), CRM and ERP, all have a \"new simplified user interface, and an integrated social network that makes our enterprise applications as easy-to-use and familiar as Facebook, while enabling better collaboration and teamwork. . . All these new application interfaces were specifically designed for use on modern mobile devices like telephones and tablets.\"\n\nElaborating, Mr Hurd tells BizIT that each of Oracle's applications has the best features, capability as well as built-in analytics. \"Oracle in the cloud is now the No 1 in ERP, No 1 in marketing automation , No 1 in service automation. . . We believe cloud is going to give us a chance to change the application landscape. We are the only one with the differentiators I described and the first to market with all these capabilities.\"\n\nTo a question on whether this shift to cloud was affecting Oracle's traditional software licensing business and the hardware business that it got from its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Mr Hurd says that the company has built up its cloud business to more than US$1 billion while at the same time posting record overall margin growth. \"Remember Oracle has done some very interesting things simultaneously. We bought a hardware company and everyone said: 'How can you have great margins in Oracle with this hardware company?' We integrated this hardware company (Sun) and this has became the bedrock of our engineering systems business.\" Overall, the company's hardware business, including hardware support, grew 2 per cent, with hardware system product revenue up US$714 million in the last quarter.\n\nAccording to Mr Hurd, not only has the engineered systems business continued to show \"excellent growth\", but they've actually become a material part of Oracle's overall hardware business, now accounting for nearly 30 per cent of all hardware product sales. \"Exadata and all our engineered systems had booking growth of nearly 35 per cent on top of similar growth last year, in the quarter,\" the Oracle official says.\n\nMr Hurd adds that all six engineered systems saw double-digit revenue growth, including the Big Data Appliance and Sparc SuperCluster, which saw triple-digit growth.\n\nHe adds that the company has \"dramatically\" increased the size of its sales force and has transitioned much of the force into the cloud and \"we've done all this while we bought probably 30 companies over the past three years. We've had a lot of transformation and we've done all this while we delivered very impressive numbers\".\n\nAsia-Pacific growth\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2014, whose results were announced in December, Oracle noted that the Asia-Pacific region declined 10 per cent with Japan \"continuing to be challenged\".\n\nHowever, as Mr Ellison pointed out during a conference call, the company performed quite strongly in China. The company has shown some weakness in Australia and New Zealand as well as Japan. Mr Ellison added: \"We really feel all around that we've got a very strong upside opportunity in Asia. We put . . . some new energy into Asia, some new excitement into Asia, and we expect it to pay off.\"\n\nEchoing Mr Ellison's sentiments, Mr Hurd says the company is \"pretty excited about Asia\".\n\n\"Every time somebody says Asia to me it's something different. It's not a homogeneous entity. I think there are several very large economies. And then you have some other exciting economies in the region, such as Vietnam, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n\"I think our view is that Oracle is poised to gain in Asia. And we are growing in Asia. . . We will be adding sales people. We will be investing in Asia and so I see Asia as a place to grow. I see it as a place to take marketshare and hence this is a place we will invest in.\"\n\nOracle feels that three product areas - database, cloud applications and engineered systems - will drive growth for the company this year. Mr Hurd adds that the company has an opportunity to extend its \"domination of IT\".\n\n\"We think that there aren't many opportunities that you get. We are not the biggest applications company out there. However, through cloud we can become the biggest.\n\n\"We think there will be an opportunity as one of our big competitors hasn't done the work to rewrite its applications for the cloud. I think this opens up a window for us that is just fantastic and we think that it's opened up globally. And therefore we want to extend our leadership position.\"\n\nHe adds that Oracle has the \"leading e-commerce capability in the world right now\". It also has the leading service automation capabilities in the world. \"So these secular changes play perfectly into our portfolio of capabilities and the interruption caused by cloud and SaaS gives us an opportunity to extend our leadership position.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Ying-luck will remain caretaker premier for weeks, facing continued anti-government protests and the prospect of a slew of legal challenges aimed at invalidating the poll.\n\nThe usual campaign billboards, glossy posters and pre-election buzz were noticeably absent this time, as were many voters fearful of violence or bent on rejecting a ballot bound to re-elect the political juggernaut controlled by Ms Ying-luck's billionaire brother, Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nFurther voting is already scheduled for Feb 23 after problems with advance balloting last Sunday, while polls in nine southern provinces where candidates were unable to register may not happen for weeks. \"To those of you who went out and prevented ballot boxes from being delivered, thank you,\" protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban said in a speech at one of seven rally sites in Bangkok, where anti-Thaksin sentiment is strong.\n\nVoting was disrupted in 18 per cent or 69 of 375 constituencies nationwide, the Election Commission said, affecting 18 of 77 provinces, where demonstrators calling for an appointed government succeeded in sabotaging the vote.\n\nWith the main opposition Democrat Party boycotting the poll, Ms Ying-luck's Puea Thai Party is expected to win comfortably.\n\nIts leader said that the election showed the public believed in democracy. \"The people are not afraid and they came out to vote today,\" said Jarupong Ruangsuwan, who is also Interior Minister. \"We've fought hard for democracy in Thailand and we proved that most Thais believe in the democratic process.\"\n\nEven if the results were known, victory celebrations for Ms Yingluck would probably be muted. With many parliamentary seats unfilled, she could be exposed to legal attacks, intensified protests and unable to pass bills and budgets crucial to reviving the economy, South-east Asia's second-biggest.\n\nThe latest round of tumult in the eight-year political conflict erupted in November and underscored Thaksin's central role in the long-running struggle, both as hero and villain.\n\nMs Yingluck was largely tolerated by Thaksin's opponents, but her party miscalculated when it tried to introduce a blanket political amnesty that would have nullified Thaksin's graft conviction and allowed him to return home.\n\nThe judiciary has taken on an unusually large number of cases in the past two months in response to complaints against Ms Ying-luck and Puea Thai that could result in the party's dissolution and lengthy bans for its top politicians.\n\nThere is also a chance the election could be annulled, as it was in 2006, over a technicality. The Election Commission is bracing for a deluge of complaints and challenges.\n\nEven if Ms Yingluck wins a fresh mandate, analysts say that opposition against her remains entrenched and continued stalemate is almost certain. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/4f8c1d7c33dbfd95627d2526438028859cbdce9c63427f74ac90ddc2de454d6c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "No end in sight: Protesters demanding the right to vote arguing with security and election officials at a Din Daeng district office where voting was called off yesterday. - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

And if he isn't busy writing, then he's probably there to get inspiration the old-fashioned way: by observing people around him and eavesdropping on their conversations.\n\nThat's exactly what he did last year while working on his latest book: Singapore Siu Dai: The SG Conversation in a Cup. The book is a collection of 50 short stories satirising daily life in Singapore, like the woes of taking public transport, our kiasu behaviour, and obsession with Hello Kitty plushies, peppered with single-page cartoons by a graphic artist who wants to be known only as PMan.\n\nThis book is Cheong's first attempt at writing humour and, according to him, it came about entirely unplanned - especially since his last eight books have mostly been poetry collections, with a couple of young adult novels.\n\nBut he believes it's a good time to release such a book, because the time is just right for a little satire here in Singapore, says Cheong, who has a background working in the media industry for about 22 years and now lectures part-time at local institutions.\n\n\"I've noticed since the 2011 elections that Singaporeans are getting very unhappy,\" he says. \"A lot of the rhetoric and unhappiness stems from the fact that we take ourselves very seriously. To quote a famous cartoon character, \"Why so serious?\" . . . That's why now we have shows like The Noose, and websites like New Nation, and I think this book is contributing to that conversation too.\"\n\nIt all started with Cheong taking long commutes between home and schools, so he decided to challenge himself to write a short story within each 45-minute time frame and post it on Facebook. When more of his friends liked it, he realised there was a market for that kind of short satire.\n\nOne of his favourite stories in the book is titled Language Therapy for Teens, and it follows the dialogue between two unnamed people: person A who obsessively uses the word \"like\" as a filler in every sentence, and person B who tries to convince person A to drop the filler and speak proper English.\n\nThis story was inspired by some of his own students at the schools where he teaches, because a lot of his students have that habit while giving presentations, says Cheong.\n\n\"I don't really base my characters on real people though, because I may get sued. So I tweak them enough so they are types that people can relate to, rather than recognisable individuals,\" he adds.\n\nAnd by relating to his characters, Cheong hopes his readers will have a good laugh and learn to take themselves less seriously.\n\n\"That's what a satirist does, after all. I notice the gap between what is and what could be, and that's where I come in and poke fun at it,\" says Cheong.\n\n\"I hope it will help lighten the mood in Singapore - that's my big aim.\"\n\n'Singapore Siu Dai: The SG Conversation in a Cup' is available at $13.91 (after GST), at Times bookstores, Books Kinokuniya, MPH bookstores, and Books Actually\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That strategy remains,\" he said.\n\nThe group will still seek to strengthen its three key pillars of property development, property investments and hotel operations going forward, Mr Liam added.\n\nRevenue from property developments fell 27 per cent in fiscal 2013 to $410 million due to weaker residential sales.\n\nBoosting the group revenue was the hotel division, which grew 11 per cent to $420.4 million, buoyed by contributions from new hotels under fully owned Pan Pacific Hotels Group.\n\nThe hotel arm has a pipeline of six hotels to be opened in Myanmar, Indonesia and China over the next few years.\n\nProperty investments saw a 9 per cent rise in revenue to $180.2 million.\n\nMr Liam said that the office sector is likely to remain positive while the retail sector may see mixed results due to rising operating costs and a labour crunch. The hotel sector may face some moderation in revenue per available room as room supply increases. While the residential sector will see some easing in selling prices, a \"hard landing\" is unlikely, he said.\n\nConceding that buyers are taking a longer time to snap up homes and investors have downsized their purchases, Mr Liam added that the group is under no pressure to lower the selling prices of its recent project, Riverbanks @ Fernvale, at Sengkang where he believes the group has gotten the strategy right for pricing and unit sizes.\n\nUOL has proposed a special dividend of 5 cents per share and a first and final dividend of 15 cents. UOL closed trading yesterday at $6.12, up five cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The result was that the Japanese economy slowed or even slid into recession after a brief run-up in consumption ahead of the increase.\n\nJapan's former vice-finance minister for international affairs Eisuke Sakakibara believes, however, that it will be different.\n\nHe told The Business Times yesterday: \"I don't think it will set back Japan's recovery this time.\"\n\nThe man better known as \"Mr Yen\" added that the April 1 rise \"has already been incorporated in the markets\".\n\n\"When you announce it in advance, people take it for granted. There may be some increase in consumption before the tax increase, and there may be some decline. But I am not worried about it.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said Japanese retail sales rose 4.4 per cent in January from their level a year earlier, marking the sixth consecutive monthly gain; the rise was also comfortably ahead of the 3.8 per cent gain predicted by economists.\n\nHousehold spending rose 1.1 per cent in January from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms; this was more than the median market forecast for a 0.2 per cent annual rise and followed a 0.7 per cent increase in the year to December.\n\nWith Japanese companies boosting their production of motor vehicles and other consumer durables ahead of the April hike, industrial output rose 4 per cent in January, in a second consecutive monthly gain.\n\nThe jump in output again was ahead of analysts' expectations of a 3 per cent rise.\n\nHowever, February data on the Japanese purchasing managers' index, which was also released yesterday, showed a slowing from the eight-year high reached in January. Analysts said this could be the start of some modest slowing in production as the April tax hike draws closer.\n\nJapanese core consumer prices - excluding volatile fresh food prices but including energy costs - rose 1.3 per cent in January from a year earlier, rising for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nThe nation's unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 per cent and the jobs-to-applicants ratio improved further.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
