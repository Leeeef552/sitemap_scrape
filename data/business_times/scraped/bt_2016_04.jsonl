The official PMI survey, which tends to focus on larger, state firms, has shown persistent declines in employment for the last 3-1/2 years.\n\nMarch data had spurred hopes that China's long suffering manufacturing sector was bottoming out, with growth in industrial output and profits and fixed-asset investment all improving.\n\nThe property recovery has spurred demand for building materials from cement and glass to steel, and the recent rebound in commodity prices is bringing in more cash for some companies to service their mountains of debt.\n\nHowever, sharp price increases for steel and iron ore have cooled after China's securities regulator ordered major commodity futures exchanges to control speculative trading.\n\nAnalysts also are worried that recent signs of improvement may be largely driven by companies and local governments taking on more debt, putting any longer-term recovery in jeopardy.\n\nChina's Big Five banks reported last week that their bad loans had increased by 53.2 billion yuan ($8.21 billion) in the first quarter, though non-performing loan ratios remained relatively stable.\n\nActivity in China's services industry, meanwhile, remained strong but grew at a slightly slower pace, with the official reading at 53.5 in April, compared with the previous month's reading of 53.8.\n\nBeijing is banking on a stronger services sector to help offset the long slump in \"old economy\" sectors such as heavy industry.\n\nREUTERS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

S&P 500 stocks on average are trading at 17 times expected earnings.\n\n\"The tide is going out a bit, but it will probably improve in the fall with the launch of the next iPhone,\" said Pat Becker Jr, principal of Becker Capital Management, which also owns Apple stock. \"This is an opportunity.\"\n\nWall Street remains positive as 36 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters recommend buying Apple's shares, while nine have neutral ratings and none recommend selling.\n\nThe median of the analysts' price targets is US$120, down from US$130 at the end of March.

Payment of the compound will be made on or before the due date,\" the Finance Ministry's entity said in relation to the May 30, 2016, deadline.\n\nIts brief statement late on Thursday night was in response to the central bank's statement that it had issued a letter of administrative compound to the development fund after the Attorney General (AG) consented to the action.\n\nAlso, BNM stressed that as it had withdrawn approvals for three previous transactions from 2009 to 2011, 1MDB was to repatriate monies remitted abroad - previously said to amount to US$1.83 billion.\n\nBNM observed 1MDB has also failed to submit evidence and documentation specified by the bank to justify its inability to fully comply with the repatriation order.\n\nBut it also said: \"The payment of the compound marks the conclusion of the investigations by Bank Negara Malaysia on the contravention to the rules and regulations of the central bank.\"\n\nPreviously, 1MDB had contended the funds could not be brought back as they had already been earmarked to part repay its massive loans of then RM42 billion (S$14.45 billion). Given that its debt rationalisation programme last week was thrown into doubt after its erstwhile ally, International Petroleum and Investment Corporation, disputed receiving payments amounting to US$3.5 billion from 1MDB, 1MDB's omission of the repatriation request was pointed.\n\nSo was BNM's neglect to mention the quantum of the compound.\n\n\"Why is the amount being kept a secret? People want to know if it is commensurate with 1MDB's actions,\" observed a corporate executive. \"It does not look good for their (BNM) professionalism and transparency.\"\n\nMs Zeti had wanted to settle the matter before handing over the reins to Muhammad Ibrahim, her successor and the most senior of her three deputies.\n\nThe seeking of the AG's consent to initiate administrative action surprised a senior banker who said it was not a requirement under the FSA. He pointed out BNM was pushed to the softer measure only after the AG, Apandi Ali, who has the sole discretion to initiate criminal proceedings, went against the central bank's recommendations to take action against 1MDB for breaches under the Exchange Control Act.\n\nThe corporate executive said it is too early in the day to talk of closure as there are so many countries investigating 1MDB, and that it is only a matter of time before the audit trail of evidence emerges. \"As a matter of fact, BNM would have presented the evidence to the then taskforce looking into 1MDB.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On April 1, the estimate was for a 7.1 per cent decline.\n\nWith dismal US gross domestic product figures released on Wednesday showing the slowest economic expansion in two years, jobs will be especially important for signaling a second-quarter recovery, Mr Johnson said.\n\nIf employment can beat estimates, markets will likely rally, Mr Johnson said, even if the number triggers talk of an impending rate hike at the Fed.\n\nAfter a slow climb since the start of the month, as many companies beat ultra-low first-quarter earnings expectations, stocks fell sharply over the last two trading days. Pushing the downturn were Apple's results, which included the first decline in iPhone sales.\n\nSACRIFICE THE SHORT TERM\n\nEven if a stronger-than-expected jobs report furthers a short-term selloff, investors would then feel more confident that a bull market is sustainable without Fed support, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.\n\n\"If we're going to see positive economic growth perpetuate, it needs to come on the back of job growth and wage increases,\" Mr Luschini said.\n\n\"If we did see some disruption as a consequence of the Fed raising interest rates, it would be welcome.\"\n\nStronger employment data signals an increase in demand for consumer goods, which typically indicates better revenue for companies.\n\n\"The jobs report is a great running barometer on how our economy is doing,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.\n\nMr Ablin said he would pay close attention next week to any changes in wage growth, which has been particularly stagnant.\n\nAverage hourly earnings gained seven US cents in March after slipping the prior month. Nonfarm payrolls rose 215,000 in March and the unemployment rate edged up to 5 per cent from an eight-year low of 4.9 per cent.\n\nIn addition to employment figures, analysts said they will continue to look at earnings reports next week, Fed officials'comments, and economic data, including manufacturing, services sector growth and car sales.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nAI is already showing signs of slashing job openings in the UK\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:30 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nNew Zealand spending slowdown adds to signs of cooling economy\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:54 AM\n\nChina\u2019s growth seen outpacing target, easing stimulus pressure\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:49 AM\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM", "images": []}

The rejiggering of Facebook's share structure, effectively a 3-for-1 stock split, follows the 31 year-old's announcement last December that he intends to put 99 per cent of his Facebook shares into a new philanthropy project focusing on human potential and equality.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that a Facebook board committee which approved the share deal \"did not bargain hard\" with Mr Zuckerberg \"to obtain anything of meaningful value\" in exchange for granting Mr Zuckerberg added control.\n\nRepresentatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nFacebook plans to create a new class of shares that are publicly listed but do not have voting rights. Facebook will issue two of the so-called \"Class C\" shares for each outstanding Class A and Class B share held by shareholders.

Its state-owned peer, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, the Asian oil-refining behemoth known as Sinopec, said a few minutes later that profit over the same period tripled to 6.66 billion yuan.\n\nPetroChina in Hong Kong helped lead declines among energy companies in Asia, falling as much as 3.7 per cent to HK$5.70 as at 9.38am local time on Friday. Sinopec lost as much as 3 per cent, while CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Corporation) slipped as much as 2.4 per cent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index was down as much as 1.3 per cent.\n\nEuropean oil giants BP, Total and Statoil beat analysts projections and posted first-quarter profits earlier this week as buoyant refining and trading arms, as well as cost-cutting, helped offset the lowest crude prices in more than 12 years.\n\n\"International oil giants including BP and Total have a much bigger presence in downstream refining and oil trading and can generate enough profit to offset their upstream losses,\" said Laban Yu, head of Asia oil and gas equities at Jefferies Group, in Hong Kong. \"PetroChina, on the other hand, doesn't have a strong presence in refining and trading to shield it from the impact of plunging oil prices.\"\n\nThe average price of crude in the quarter slumped 36 per cent from the same period the year before under a glut that stretched from US shale basins to the Arabian peninsula and Siberian oil fields. A rapid recovery from this year's bottom amid signs of sliding supply may only partially help swing the balance back in PetroChina's favour, according to Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co.\n\n\"An oil price rebound will help moving forward, but PetroChina just simply needs to do an awful lot more to improve the competitiveness and performance of the company,\" he said \"Maybe some one-off asset sales will help, but they certainly need to work more aggressively in cost cutting as they are just lagging in terms of margins across the board.\"\n\nRefining margins in China were supported in the first quarter after the government of President Xi Jinping decided to halt fuel price adjustments when oil falls below US$40 a barrel. The policy boosted domestic margins during the period to US$16 a barrel, a 45 per cent increase from the same period a year earlier, according to researcher ICIS China.\n\nPetroChina's oil and gas output is expected to fall for the first time in 17 years in 2016 as it shuts high-cost fields that have \"no hope\" of making profits at current prices, president Wang Dongjin said last month.\n\nOperating profit from exploration and production in the first quarter swung to a 20.3 billion yuan loss from a 17.3 billion yuan gain. The 37 billion yuan change is roughly equivalent to its full-year 2015 net income.\n\nSinopec, Asia's biggest refiner, processed 57.2 million tonnes of crude oil (about 4.6 million barrels a day) during the quarter, compared with PetroChina's 33.7 million tonnes (about 2.7 million barrels a day), the companies said in separate earnings statements. BP's downstream operations, which includes refining and trading, brought in US$1.8 billion before interest and taxes in the quarter, helping overcome a loss in oil and gas production. The company's adjusted profits of US$532 million smashed analyst estimates of a loss of US$250 million.\n\nStatoil's cost cuts helped it eke out US$122 million in adjusted earnings after tax, compared with an expected loss of US$125 million based on forecasts of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nTotal reported Q1 profit of US$1.64 billion on Wednesday, beating the average analyst estimate of US$1.25 billion, as it cut costs, boosted production and benefited from resilient refining earnings.\n\nCNOOC, the third China oil major, posted a 31 per cent drop in quarterly revenue on Thursday, even as output rose 5.1 per cent and capital spending was slashed by 39 per cent. If the company had reported quarterly net income, it would have been a loss, said Mr Yu at Jefferies in Hong Kong.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/understanding-cholesterol", "site_title": "Understanding cholesterol", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUnderstanding cholesterol\n\nSetting LDL-C target levels makes it easier for both doctors and patients to manage risks for heart disease and stroke resulting from blockage of arteries\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 29, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nIN the last month, during my interactions with members of the public and doctors after the educational talks I had given, the impression was that many thought that there are no target levels of cholesterol that need to be adhered to.\n\nSince the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, there has been a major paradigm shift from the past practice of focusing on target levels of cholesterol levels to be achieved, to one where cholesterol lowering was considered adequate or not depending on the percentage of cholesterol lowering from the baseline after commencement of medication. Not surprisingly, one doctor asked me: \"So does it mean that as long as the patient is given cholesterol medication, it does not matter what the final cholesterol level is?\"\n\nDespite the major paradigm shift, what is not known to many people is that although the new 2013 approach varied substantially from the previous 2006 cholesterol guideline where absolute levels of target cholesterol were recommended, the evidence upon which the 2013 guideline was based was substantially the same as that on which the 2006 guideline was based.\n\nCholesterol fractions\n\nCholesterol in the blood can be divided into three main \"fractions\", namely the bad or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and remnant cholesterol (total cholesterol minus LDL-C and HDL-C). For those who have been told that HDL-C represented \"good\" cholesterol, there is now substantial clinical evidence to show that this is a myth.\n\nMany studies in the last decade had demonstrated that significant elevation of HDL-C following the administration of medication was not associated with any reduction in heart artery disease. Most of the evidence that showed that the lowering of LDL-C was associated with a reduction in heart disease came from trials that used statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) to lower LDL-C.\n\nRisk groups\n\nThose who can potentially benefit from lowering of LDL-C were divided into four risk categories. Those with known heart artery disease, stroke or narrowing of limb arteries will inevitably benefit from LDL-C lowering. For those who have no known disease of the arteries, if there is severe elevation of the LDL-C (greater than or equal to 190 mg/dl) due to genetic causes, or who are diabetics with increased risk of heart artery disease, LDL-C reduction with statins is beneficial.\n\nFor primary prevention, that is, where there is no evidence of arterial disease and the main reason for starting statins is to prevent future events, a discussion with your doctor about pros and cons is important as the potential benefit in the near term may only be marginal. This is especially so when the patient is a premenopausal female who is planning for a pregnancy, in which case statins should be avoided.\n\nCholesterol reduction\n\nThe reduction in the risk of developing heart attacks or stroke is related to the degree of lowering of LDL-C, that is, the lower the better. The 2013 guidelines focused on the degree of LDL-C lowering rather than specific LDL-C targets. The level of therapeutic response is used to gauge response to treatment. Adequate LDL-C lowering was broadly categorised into two broad groups: greater than or equal to 50 per cent reduction in LDL-C for those who were on high-dose statins, and 30 per cent to less than 50 per cent reduction in LDL-C from pre-treatment level for those on moderate doses of statin.\n\nDepending on the risk profile, high or moderate dose statins will be recommended to achieve adequate LDL-C lowering. While the degree of LDL-C reduction is used as a measure of adequacy of response to treatment, the 2013 guidelines did add that maximal benefit was seen where certain LDL-C targets were achieved and stated that \"in those already on a statin, in whom baseline LDL-C is unknown, an LDL-C level less than 100 mg/dl was observed in most individuals receiving high-intensity statin therapy\". This was based on trials that showed that statin therapy which lowered the LDL-C to less than 100 mg/dl had significantly more reduction in heart attacks and stroke than those who achieved LDL-C targets above 100 mg/dl.\n\nClearing the cholesterol confusion\n\nAs a result of ensuing \"confusion\" resulting from the \"no LDL-C target\" 2013 cholesterol guidelines, the 2016 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Non-Statin Therapies for LDL-Cholesterol Lowering in the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk was released so that \"clinicians and patients may seek firmer and more specific guidance on the adequacy of statin therapy\". The expert panel also stated that \"it was appropriate to provide levels of LDL-C, or thresholds, in terms of both percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline and absolute on-treatment LDL-C measurement, which, if not achieved by adherent patients, would serve as factors to consider in decision-making regarding further therapy\".\n\nHence, this latest 2016 expert consensus document re-established specific LDL-C targets for different risk groups, similar to the 2006 cholesterol guidelines.\n\nThe first risk group comprises those with inherited severe elevation of LDL-C (greater than or equal to 190 mg/dl). If there is underlying heart artery disease or stroke, life-long statin therapy is needed. The recommended target for this group of patients is greater than or equal to 50 per cent reduction in LDL-C, a LDL-C less than 70 mg/dl.\n\nWhenever the maximally tolerable dose of statin is unable to achieve this target, it is considered appropriate to add a non-statin drug as adjunctive treatment. The first choice is ezetimibe (a blocker of LDL-C absorption through the intestine) or a new class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors (increases uptake of LDL-C by the liver for degradation). PCSK9 inhibitors can potentially lower LDL-C by 50 per cent to 60 per cent.\n\nIt is, however, given once fortnightly or monthly by injection and is substantially more expensive than oral statins or ezetimibe (can lower LDL-C by about 20 per cent). For those with other risk factors for heart disease but have no known heart disease or arterial disease, a target LDL-C less than 100 mg/dl or non-HDL-C less than 130 mg/dl in patients with diabetes is recommended. However, if there are no other risk factors except for high cholesterol, a LDL-C less than 130 mg/dl is considered sufficient.\n\nThe second risk group comprises those with known heart artery disease. If they have no co-morbid factors such as recent heart attacks/stroke (less than three months), diabetes, poorly controlled risk factors, or associated medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, a greater than or equal to 50 per cent reduction in LDL-C or a LDL-C less than100 mg/dl is recommended. If these co-morbid factors are present, a LDL-C less than 70 mg/dl or non-HDL-C less than 100 mg/dl for diabetics is recommended.\n\nThe third risk category encompasses diabetics without known arterial disease aged 40 years or more and a baseline LDL-C of 70-189 mg/dl who either have diabetic complications or have other risk factors. The recommended target is a LDL-C less than 100 mg/dl or non-HDL-C less than 130 mg/dl. Whenever this target cannot be achieved with lifestyle changes and statin drugs, the addition of ezetimibe can be considered. Where ezetimibe is insufficiently effective or if there is intolerance, bile acid sequestrants (such as Cholestyramine or Colesevelam) can be considered. Currently, the role of PCSK9 inhibitors in diabetics without established arterial disease is uncertain.\n\nThe last risk category are adults aged 40 years or more, without heart arterial disease, stroke or diabetes, who have increased risk of heart disease based on a risk score calculation. They may be advised by their doctors to start on statins to prevent future heart attacks, stroke or death.\n\nThis group of patients should consider achieving a target LDL-C less than 100 mg/dl. Non-statin drugs are not required unless there is statin intolerance. If these patients have risk factors such as LDL-C greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl at baseline, poorly controlled risk factors, family history of premature heart disease, coronary artery calcification, chronic kidney disease, HIV or chronic inflammatory disorders, non-statin therapy can be added to achieve the desired targets.\n\nCholesterol made simple\n\nSetting LDL-C target levels make it easier for both doctors and patients to manage the risk for heart disease and stroke resulting from blockage of arteries. If you inherited severe elevation of LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dl, your post-treatment target LDL-C level is less than 70 mg/dl if you have existing heart blocked arteries or stroke, less than 100 mg/dl if you have no heart artery disease but have other risk factors and less than 130 mg/dl if you have no heart artery disease, stroke or other risk factors.\n\nIf you have pre-existing heart artery disease, the LDL-C target is less than 70 mg/dl if there are co-morbidities and less than 100 mg/dl if there are none.\n\nStatin treatment to reduce LDL-C to less than 100 mg/dl is also recommended if you are a diabetic with diabetic complications, higher-risk diabetic with other existing risk factors or have increased risk of heart artery disease or stroke based on risk scoring. Hence, for at-risk patients, lowering to specific LDL-C targets continues to be relevant in the management of these patients.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will enter the canal from the Atlantic Ocean side and cross to the Pacific.\n\nA smaller Japanese freighter, the Linden Pride, is set to travel the canal next the following day.\n\nThe United States - which built the original canal a century ago and kept strategic control until 1977 - is the biggest user of the canal by tonnage.\n\nThe expansion work went well beyond its initial 2014 deadline and US$5.25 billion budget.\n\nThe overruns caused friction between the Spanish-led consortium that took on the contract and the Panamanian government.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Add too little or too much of an ingredient and your cake could turn out less than perfect.\n\nBatterful, a new baking subscription service takes the guesswork out of baking. Each month, subscribers get a box filled with pre-portioned ingredients, a recipe menu, bakewares, such as muffin cups, extra materials such as parchment paper or bamboo sticks, and an online video guide for the recipe. You will however, need to have your own baking equipment.\n\nCo-founder Gary Thong says that he and his business partner Ted Chong noticed many successful meal kits available for subscription in the United States. \"For Singapore, we wanted to find an untapped niche using a similar business model,\" he says. Mr Chong and Mr Thong, both 26, are avid self-taught bakers and so they decided to choose a baking subscription service. \"We also realised that this business can provide tremendous value to people who bake,\" says Mr Chong.\n\nEach month, the Batterful website shows four recipes that are available. Subscribers pick a recipe that they want to try, and get a Batterful box delivered to them. The subscription costs from S$19.95 a month, with a S$2.95 monthly delivery fee. Subscribers can cancel their subscription any time.\n\n\"We have customers who have ordered more than one recipe by subscribing twice,\" says Mr Thong. \"Moving forward we plan on allowing customers to choose multiple recipes in one subscription.\"\n\nHe adds that with Batterful, baking is more convenient, as there is no hassle of planning what ingredients are needed, and having to head to the supermarkets to get them. Batterful uses only natural and organic ingredients for their boxes, from brands such as Bob's Red Mill, King Arthur's and Waitrose.\n\nAs ingredients are pre-portioned, there is less wastage. \"Many bakers find that they need to buy a tonne of a certain ingredient just to use less than a teaspoon of the said ingredient. Through our pre-portioned service, we eliminate this problem,\" says Mr Thong.\n\nThey work with professionals, such as The Fabulous Baker Boy cafe and baking enthusiasts to create the monthly recipes. \"Every single recipe that we provide has been tried and tested,\" says Mr Chong.\n\nThe difficulty levels of the recipes range from easy to intermediate, says Mr Thong. \"However, with our step-by-step guides, including an online video for each recipe, anyone can make them.\"\n\nMr Chong adds that they make difficult recipes easy for their customers to create. \"Naturally, because of this feature, we predominantly target casual bakers and people who are just beginning to learn baking. With that said, the convenience which Batterful provides can also easily attract advanced bakers who just want to try out new recipes with the ingredients delivered to their doorstep.\"\n\nSome of the recipes are Apple Sage and Rosemary Crumb Cake, Strawberry Clafoutis and Berry Delight No-Bake Cheesecake. Apart from providing subscription boxes, Batterful also occasionally holds baking events with The Fabulous Baker Boy cafe. \"What we want to achieve is a tight-knit community of avid bakers,\" says Mr Thong. \"We want to bring our subscribers together and let them share their baking experiences and at the same time have a chance to see a professional at work and learn from them.\"\n\nMATCHA BREW\n\nInner Matcha\n\ninnermatcha.com\n\nTHE founders of Inner Matcha, a green tea subscription service, say the company was started out of necessity. Co-founder Cheong En Liang says that he and his business partner and long-time friend, Jordan Tan, were both heavy coffee drinkers. \"With that amount of caffeine that we were both drinking daily, crashes and jitters were becoming habitual,\" says Mr Cheong. \"We realised that we needed to find an alternative, something that still had the same coffee kick, but without the less desirable effects and addiction,\" he says.\n\nThe duo, both 27, were introduced to matcha. \"Not only is matcha healthier, it also kept us fresh and awake throughout the day, unlike coffee,\" says Mr Cheong.\n\nThey have both given up coffee. \"I still have untouched bags of coffee beans/grounds lying around my house,\" says Mr Cheong. \"Even Jordan's French Press is being repurposed to be used in experimenting on new matcha recipes.\"\n\nThey were intrigued by its benefits and went around Singapore looking for good quality matcha that was also affordable. \"Sadly, we could only find either very expensive matcha from boutique stores or low-grade matcha from supermarkets,\" says Mr Cheong. \"Our inability to find what we wanted made us both realise we were on to something, and as aspiring entrepreneurs, started Inner Matcha.\"\n\nThe two continued their search for high quality yet affordable matcha. \"We began sampling and tasting countless matcha varieties from dozens of suppliers in Japan,\" says Mr Cheong. They got suppliers' contacts through Mr Tan's mother who used to run a Japanese food import company, and sampled close to 60 different qualities and types of green tea powder. The two also frequented trade fairs, to cross-reference samples and accumulate information about matcha and various teaware.\n\nAfter numerous cups, they finally found a supplier from Ise Bay in Mie Prefecture, which has over 800 years of history in harvesting top ceremonial grade green tea leaves. \"Our supplier not only had the type of tea we were looking for, but he also aligns himself with Inner Matcha's vision, which is to spread the word about matcha,\" says Mr Cheong.\n\nMatcha is made from green tea leaves that are ground into a fine green powder which is then dissolved in boiling hot water, as opposed to traditional tea which is brewed using tea bags or loose leaves and are seldom consumed in the process. As a result, the nutritional benefits are 10 times higher for matcha as compared to a regular cup of green tea. Some of matcha's benefits include having 137 times more antioxidants than regular green tea, and being able to lower bad cholesterol while increasing the good cholesterol. Matcha is also widely believed to increase the body's rate of burning calories, while helping to improve the body's defence system. Inner Matcha offers three grades of matcha: Morning Matcha, Vitality Matcha and Culinary Matcha.\n\nMorning Matcha is good for those who want to make matcha a part of their daily life, says Mr Cheong. It comes with the right amount of froth, and with a mild sweetness. Vitality Matcha is made using the first harvest of young leaves, and it has a bittersweet flavour profile reminiscent of dark chocolate. Culinary Matcha is made for blending, baking and cooking, ideal for lattes, smoothies and cakes. The powder is made of a coarser grind.\n\nA typical monthly subscription starts from S$24, which gets the customer a fresh tin of matcha every month. Mr Cheong says the best way to enjoy the matcha is to sip it from a tea bowl. Water that is heated to 85 deg C is used. He recommends using a bamboo whisk to press down on the powder, and then moving it in an \"M\" motion to create the froth. \"Simply whisk it and then sip it,\" he says. To complete the matcha drinking experience, Inner Matcha also has a range of teawares.\n\n\"Our most popular product is the Inner Matcha Starter Kit, which consists of all the utensils you need to make a perfect cup of matcha green tea,\" he says. By next quarter, the founders hope to include a pre-mixed custom matcha latte blend that will come in a satchet form.\n\n\"This will be made from actual organic matcha, instead of just processed matcha flavouring,\" says Mr Cheong. \"We also have plans to expand our teaware section with one-of-a-kind ceramic artisan crafted bowls from Japan.\"\n\nHEALTHY SNACK ATTACK\n\nMade Real\n\nmadereal.sg\n\nDO you chomp on potato chips or indulge in an iced coffee drink topped with whipped cream to keep your hunger pangs away? All that will leave you feeling full, but you may end up gaining undesirable pounds.\n\nEnter Made Real, a subscription service that curates wholesome yet yummy snacks that meet health goals and nutritional needs.\n\nHere's how it works: You fill up a quiz to find out your frequency of snacking; the category of snacks you like such as nuts, seeds or dried foods; your health and fitness goals and food allergy or dietary preferences. Using the answers, Made Real puts together a box with six recommended snacks, that can range from dried fruit to a little bag of granola and a packet of nuts.\n\n\"Using the thought process of a nutritionist, we tailor-make the snack boxes for each individual based on his/her health and fitness needs and dietary preferences. Our vision is to simplify the process by which people seek nutrition advice and products,\" says Roslyn Teng, 20, co-founder and chief marketing/operations officer of Made Real.\n\nThe other members of Made Real are Robin Lim, co-founder and chief executive officer, Ray Song, chief technology officer and Iwani Mawocha, user experience/user interface designer.\n\nMade Real started in 2014 as a social project to spread awareness on balanced living and disordered eating.\n\n\"We did content and events for about a year and were spending a huge portion of our time building the brand,\" she says.\n\nBut even before starting Made Real, she and Ms Lim had a strong, personal interest in health foods, and say they are both health freaks. \"We found the convenience, novelty, and wholesome aspects of subscription snack boxes in Australia and the United States compelling. We thus decided to take this idea and implement it here,\" says Ms Teng.\n\n\"Our aim was to deliver carefully curated snack boxes to meet the needs of busy individuals who value high quality foods and an active, wholesome lifestyle,\" she says, hence they launched the subscription snack box service.\n\nMade Real works with a mix of local and regional producers, and are focused on featuring independent, craft food producers. Most of these producers can be found in specialIty or health food grocers, online stores, and pop up events, but Made Real takes the guesswork out of snacking healthily.\n\n\"We help you skip the hassle of researching on nutrition, and then implementing this to your own dietary needs by providing a wholesome, tailored and convenient product,\" she says. \"Above all, our snacks are minimally processed and make for more nutritious alternatives to the vast majority of supermarket snacks.\"\n\nCustomers can choose to have their snacks delivered bi-weekly or monthly. Each box is priced at S$24.90, and the snacks vary with each delivery.\n\n\"With a subscription, you will receive snack boxes catered to your needs on a regular basis, so motivation levels to eat healthy are kept high,\" says Ms Teng.\n\nTo date, they have more than 2,000 people who have signed up for the service, and they are mostly women between the ages of 18 and 34.\n\n\"We want to empower people with the ability to design not only their snacking habits, but also their overall nutrition, fitness, wellness and lifestyle as a whole,\" says Ms Teng. \"We are starting with a snack box but we believe that the sky is the limit in improving our health and lifestyles.\"\n\nTHE PERFECT CUPPA\n\nHook Coffee\n\nwww.hookcoffee.com.sg\n\nFOR heavy coffee drinkers, not having their joe may leave them feeling tired, cranky and just not in top form.\n\nThe founders of Hook Coffee, a coffee subscription service, say that their customers never have to worry about running out of coffee ever. But this is not the ordinary three-in-one coffee.\n\nHook Coffee aims to make freshly roasted speciality coffee conveniently accessible to everyone, by mailing the coffee to the customer.\n\nIts founders Ernest Ting, 25, and Faye Sit, 24, decided to start their own coffee business while doing their master's in London. The couple who are heavy coffee drinkers, saw an enormous potential in serving the home-brewing segment of the market with artisanal coffee, but done in a convenient format. That resulted in the start of Hook Coffee, which has over 800 subscribers since it began in January.\n\nHook Coffee sells five types of coffee, with the most popular being the Sweet Bundchen from Brazil and Kopi Sutra from West Java. \"They are naturally chocolatey and are slightly darker roasts, which the masses are more familiar with,\" says Ms Sit. Customers start by doing a quiz to build their personal sensory taste profiles. Some may like citrusy notes, while others like berries, chocolate or caramel. Then they pick how strong they usually like their coffee.\n\n\"Our recommendation engine helps customers decide which coffee to get, based on how they brew, and enjoy their coffee,\" says Ms Sit. \"Every time the customer rates a coffee he or she has tried, the engine gets smarter at recommending coffee for the user.\"\n\nThen there is the Coffee Calculator which helps customers choose and manage their delivery frequency suited to their drinking habits. \"Based on the number of cups of coffee they drink in a week, we will recommend them the optimum delivery frequency, so they do not have to worry about getting more than they need, or running out unexpectedly,\" says Ms Sit.\n\nWhile the recommendation engine does its job, customers can also choose to have the beans they want, or ask to be surprised with a different coffee each time. They can also choose between whole beans, ground coffee or coffee drip bags. If they request for ground coffee, the beans are ground on demand and can be calibrated to work with various brew methods such as the Espresso machine, French press, AeroPress, Dripper and Stovetop Moka Pot .\n\nWhole beans and ground coffee cost S$18 for a 250g bag, and this makes 12 to 15 cups of espresso or 15 to 24 cups of coffee via other brew methods. The coffee drip bags cost S$18 for a pack of 10. And unlike traditional subscription models, Hook Coffee does not tie its customers to any contract. \"Subscribers can edit, pause or cancel their subscription at any time. Customers can also place one-off orders if they are less frequent coffee drinkers or simply need more coffee,\" says Ms Sit.\n\nThe couple also pride themselves on sending out coffee within seven days of roasting, \"so that the coffee will reach customers at their peak,\" says Ms Sit.\n\nHook Coffee will soon introduce Nespresso-compatible capsules. \"We anticipate very positive response and traction for the capsules,\" says Ms Sit.\n\nHIGHLY EXCLUSIVE SAKE\n\nSakemaru\n\nsakemaru.me/sg\n\nWITH about 1,500 sake breweries in Japan, each of them producing dozens of labels, knowing which sake to drink can be mind-boggling.\n\nTaichi Abe, founder of sake subscription service, Sakemaru, hopes to make that task a little easier.\n\n\"The world of sake is rather complex. There are factors such as the grade, temperature and preservation methods that affect each sake,\" says Mr Abe, who is also a sake sommelier. \"Sakemaru was started to break down the complexity of sake.\"\n\nThrough Sakemaru, he introduces \"small and unknown but good breweries in Japan\". He says that these sake producers may not have the budget or know-how on how to promote the sake on their own.\n\nFor S$50 a month, subscribers get a 720ml bottle of seasonal Junmai or Jumai Gingo grade sake. Unlike sakes which are found on the shelves, Sakemaru's sakes are unfiltered and unpasteurised, and they are very rarely available, even in Japan. Filtering and pasteurising prevents the taste of sake from degrading, but Mr Abe says the resulting sake then lacks individuality.\n\n\"An unfiltered and unpasteurised sake has an aroma that is fresher and cleaner, a taste that is complex. The colour is also a little yellowish because it has not been filtered. Some of this type of sake is a little sparkling, as the yeast is still alive in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"To preserve Sakemaru's sakes, we recommend refrigerating the bottle of sake immediately upon receiving it, and to drink it up quickly once it has been opened,\" says Mr Abe. He assures that the sake from the breweries is always kept chilled until it reaches the customer.\n\nAccording to Mr Abe, the taste of sake also changes according to seasons. In winter, which is sake brewing season, the sake produced is a \"little sparkling and tastes very fresh\", says Mr Abe. In spring and summer, sake is matured in the brewery, and \"the taste is a little softer and smoother,\" says Mr Abe.\n\nIn autumn, when the sake has matured for more than six months, \"the taste is very mild and rich, totally different from the sake that has been brewed in winter.\"\n\nSome of the breweries where the sake comes from are Tempoichi Shuzo, a 106-year-old small brewery in Hiroshima, Kikuzakari Shuzo, a family run brewery from Iwate Prefecture and Mikunibare Shuzo, a 131-year-old brewery in Ikuji Kurobe, famed for its water quality.\n\nThe sakes from Sakemaru are available exclusively through them. Sakemaru also offers a snow dormitory cellar service for its customers. \"The snow dorm is located in North Japan which always has snow even in summer,\" says Mr Abe. Historically, the Japanese built snow dorms to store their meats and vegetables.\n\n\"For Sakemaru, we put our customers' sake in the snow dorm for them to mature for a year,\" says Mr Abe. \"We deliver the aged sake to them a year later. The snow dorm is cooled by natural snow, and the temperature is kept between zero to 5 deg C throughout the year.\n\n\"Under this perfect condition, the taste of sake tends to be sweeter and milder than fresh ones,\" says Mr Abe. The use of the snow dorm cellar is inclusive in the subscription price.\n\nMr Abe declined to reveal the number of subscribers he has, but says, there are more men than women. \"A majority of them are in their 30s,\" he says.\n\nIn the future, he hopes to be able to offer personalisation services for customers, by creating new sakes for them. \"And hopefully, we can also connect our customers to the breweries directly,\" he says.\n\nIn Singapore, restaurants and sake shops have been bringing in different sake labels. \"But unfiltered and unpasteurised sake is still new in Singapore,\" says Mr Abe. \"I believe drinking this type of sake will be a typical experience soon.\"\n\nWHISKY GUIDE\n\nWhisky Butler\n\nwhiskybutler.sg\n\nIf Benjamin Tan had his way, all whisky lovers would be sampling lesser-known whiskies not in a bar, but in the comfort of their homes.\n\nWhisky Butler, a subscription service, which Mr Tan is a co-founder of, allows consumers to do just that.\n\n\"We believe that the whisky drinker is a curious drinker. They are adventurous and want to try a variety of whiskies with a rich heritage and story to tell behind their making. And we want to introduce these whiskies to our customers, to provide an educational journey in whisky and to allow different expressions of appreciation towards whiskies,\" says Mr Tan, 31, who left his consultant job to run Whisky Butler full-time.\n\nMr Tan recalls that a few years back during a whisky-tasting session with friends, the idea of an online whisky tasting club came up. \"We wondered, besides at bars, where could people get to try a wide range of whiskies without having to purchase a full bottle,\" says Mr Tan.\n\nHe also realised that everyone's palate is different when it comes to whisky tasting. \"You may be able to pick up some tasting notes that another person can't although it often doesn't deviate too much from the many published tasting notes found online,\" says Mr Tan.\n\n\"Therefore, an online tasting club would also give the opportunity to develop one's tasting palate with an open mind instead of just drinking the regular club selection of whiskies that are often more marketed or generally recognised.\"\n\nFor a monthly fee, subscribers get four 20ml tasting-size whiskies that come in a gift box. Each set of whisky is specially curated by a dedicated team of whisky connoisseurs, and comprises whiskies from around the world. Accompanying each whisky is a tasting guide that introduces the history and making of the whisky, as well as a description on the tasting notes. The Whisky Butler team decides on which whiskies to include by taste, availability and the cost to acquire. \"If it fits in with our monthly theme, we include it into our tasting box,\" says Mr Tan.\n\nFor example, this month's tasting box contains whisky from Glenfiddich, one of the largest single malt whisky distilleries in Scotland, including samples of the special Gallery collection, which are the 22 Year Rum Cask, and the 23-year-old Refill Hogshead. Mr Tan admits that with the ubiquitous online market, most whiskies from the Whisky Butler can be found elsewhere. \"But it may not be easily available in Singapore in a sampling quantity,\" he points out.\n\nSubscription rates start from S$74 a month for a 12-month plan, or there is also the S$88 monthly, \"pay-as-you-go\" plan. Full bottles and exclusive bottlings are also available at special member-only prices.\n\nMr Tan says that as the local market is still new to whisky appreciation, he believes his subscription-based model for whisky sampling is the right fit for the Singapore market.\n\nHe says the member base has been growing steadily and on target. The boxes have been popular with companies too, as they are given as corporate gifts to clients.\n\nWith more than 10,000 varieties of whiskies on the market, Mr Tan, who is also a big whisky collector, says it will take subscribers well over 15 years to receive the same whisky again.\n\n\"I hope to one day build up a large enough customer base to offer exclusive single cask bottling that are available only for members,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

short for the business's original name AirBed & Breakfast - is the biggest of several sites that allow people to offer and find such rental accommodation worldwide.\n\nWhile Berlin has become one of Europe's top travel destinations, with 30.2 million overnight stays last year, the Airbnb trend has also impacted the local hotel industry.\n\nAccording to research firm GBI, the private online bookings represent a \"parallel market of an additional 6.1 million\" overnight stays a year.\n\nThe new law was passed in 2014 and provided for a two-year transition period that ended on April 30, after which owners are only allowed to rent out rooms via such portals, not entire flats or houses.\n\nOffenders can face fines of up to 100,000 euros (S$153,882).\n\nTo catch them, the city has even appealed to the \"civic spirit\" of its residents and asked them to anonymously report any suspected misuse online.\n\nTim Boening, a 41-year-old artists' agent who rents out a loft in the trendy Kreuzberg district, said he wasn't shocked by the new law, given the practices he has witnessed.\n\nThere is, for example, \"the nice couple with two small apartments who move in together into a bigger place and keep the two apartments to rent them out on Airbnb,\" he told\n\nAFP\n\n.\n\n\"I don't think that's good, it should be stopped,\" he said, as these apartments are not available to \"normal\" tenants.\n\nOwner Marika, not her real name, couldn't agree less and is furious about the change, having long rented out four apartments near the centre of Berlin via Airbnb.\n\nShe believed that the city is making Berliners pay for its failed housing policy while serving the needs of the hotel industry.\n\n\"This is unfair, we are forbidden from doing our work,\" said Ms Marika.\n\nThe only impact, she argued, would be that some groups, especially families, will simply stay away.\n\nShe was especially angry about the request to turn in offenders, saying that \"in Germany, of all places, maybe we should reconsider this kind of thing,\" in reference to the Nazi and former East German communist dictatorship in which denouncing others was common practice.\n\nAirbnb Germany said \"Berliners want clear and simple rules for home sharing, so they can continue to share their own home with guests\".\n\nThe practice differs from other types of accommodation \"and helps many Berliners pay their rent,\" spokesman Julian Trautwein told\n\nAFP\n\nin a statement.\n\n\"We will continue to encourage Berlin policy-makers to listen to their citizens and to follow the example of other big cities such as Paris, London, Amsterdam or Hamburg and create new, clear rules for normal people who are sharing their own homes.\" Wimdu has meanwhile filed a suit, arguing the law breaches the constitution of the city-state of Berlin.\n\nAnd the owners of start-up 9Flats said they had sold the brand to a Singapore company.\n\n\"We face a law in Berlin that would drive us into bankruptcy,\" its boss Roman Bach told the daily\n\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\n\n.\n\nSeveral property owners who use Airbnb have formed the \"Apartments Allianz\" to push back against the charge they are evil capitalists growing rich on the backs of fellow Berliners.\n\nRather, they say, they have offered \"an attractive, varied range of beautiful and individual apartments\", and have through their personal hospitality \"significantly contributed to a positive image for Berlin\".\n\nThey say they are \"not international players, but working in Berlin for Berlin\".\n\nAFP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their ultimate success, however, depends on avoiding some of the pitfalls that still dog the German power market including high retail prices, weakened former state utilities and high use of coal.\n\nSparked by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami which highlighted problems in transferring electricity across regions and led to the shutdown of nuclear reactors, the reforms are part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plans to boost an economy in the doldrums.\n\nFrom April 1, the government ended regional monopolies that were formed after World War II, opening up retail gas and electricity markets to competition. It hopes the changes will help create a thriving wholesale market, driving down prices for industrial and retail customers alike.\n\nIn the first month of the new marketplace, more than 740,000 Japanese retail electricity users switched to new suppliers, according to the national grid monitor OCCTO, and wholesale trading volumes on the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) surged, albeit from a tiny base.\n\n\"The number of customers switching is encouraging and the pick-up in JEPX activity levels is also welcome news as building capacity in the wholesale market will be key to ensuring success in liberalised markets,\" said Tom O'Sullivan of energy consultancy Mathyos Japan.\n\nHowever, Japan needs to avoid the problems that beset Germany's liberalisation, particularly a collapse in wholesale power prices due to a flood of subsidised green energy that gutted its big utilities. \"They are very cognisant of what has happened in Germany. They have been in there, they met government officials and industry practitioners,\" Mr O'Sullivan noted. \"I think the chances of success are 50/50 at this stage.\"\n\nJapan and Germany's power markets share many similarities - declining demand, subsidies for renewable energy, a dormant or declining nuclear sector, and energy-intensive industries.\n\nGermany's experience, however, has reaped mixed results.\n\nHuge subsidies mean renewable energy sources account for nearly a third of the power mix, but the capacity glut has cut wholesale prices by 70 per cent since 2008. This drove down costs for the country's chemical, automobile and other industries, but slashed revenues for major utilities.\n\nSmaller businesses and households, however, have been hit with steep retail costs in order to finance renewable subsidies, while industry enjoys a raft of exemptions.\n\nJapan, too, has posted explosive growth in subsidised renewable energy, particularly solar, since preferential rates were introduced in 2012. Solar now meets as much as 10 per cent of power demand.\n\nCritics say subsidies must be rolled back fast to avoid the creation of a renewables capacity glut that erodes wholesale power prices and, with it, revenues for conventional power plant operators.\n\nIn Germany, renewable subsidies, taxes and other government levies accounted for 54 per cent of retail power prices last year, and within that supporting feed-in tariffs was the biggest single item totalling 24 billion euros (S$37 billion).\n\nIn Japan, government sanctioned preferential rates for renewable energy supplies added about 1.3 trillion yen (S$16.3 billion) to electricity bills in the year through March, double the year earlier, according to the industry ministry.\n\nWith their revenues eroded, German utilities have switched to using the cheapest form of generation, meaning that a country that is proud of its green energy revolution still relies on the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal, to meet about 40 per cent of demand.\n\nIn Japan, coal use has also hit records as utilities similarly switched to the cheapest substitute for nuclear, with thermal coal imports rising for a fourth straight year in 2015.\n\nTepco, meanwhile, has so far lost about 2 per cent of its customers. It could take a US$90 million hit to its pre-tax profit for the year to March 2017, according to the Nikkei newspaper.

Since its August peak, Valeant has lost more than 85 per cent of its stock-market value, failed to file its annual report on time and said it is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOutgoing Chief Executive Officer Mike Pearson, former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller and billionaire investor Bill Ackman appeared before a US Senate committee last week, apologising for the company's behaviour and promising to lower the price of certain hospital drugs for all customers. They faced questions from senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nBerkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger has criticised Valeant's practices, drawing return fire from activist investor Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is one of the biggest shareholders in the drugmaker.\n\n\"Valeant of course is a sewer, and those who created it deserve all the opprobrium that they got,\" Mr Munger said at Saturday's annual meeting.\n\nValeant's largest shareholder as of March 31 is investment firm Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb - which has longtime ties to Mr Buffett. It runs the mutual fund Sequoia Fund, which has faltered as a result of its big bet on the drugmaker.\n\nIn March, Robert Goldfarb retired as Ruane Cunniff CEO and Sequoia co-manager in the wake of the fund's poor performance and the firm's defense of its Valeant stake as redemptions rose. Two of the fund's outside directors resigned in October including Sharon Osberg, a former world bridge champion and partner of Mr Buffett in the card game.\n\nSequoia traces its roots to Mr Buffett. It was co-founded in 1970 by Richard Cunniff and William Ruane, a friend of Mr Buffett's from the time the two studied together under legendary value investor Benjamin Graham at Columbia University. When Mr Buffett shut down his partnership in 1969 to concentrate on Berkshire, he recommended clients invest with Ruane.\n\n\"I think it was a very unfortunate period when the manager got overly entrenched with a business model,\" Mr Buffett said about the fund during Saturday's meeting. \"Even now, if you take the record from inception to now with the trouble they've had recently, I don't know of a mutual fund in the US that has a better record. There probably is one, maybe or two, but it's far better than the S&P.\"\n\nThe US$5.3 billion Sequoia Fund declined 11 per cent this year through April 29, trailing almost all of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund has returned 14 per cent a year from 1970 through the end of 2015, according to a March letter to shareholders from the firm. That beat the annualised gains of the S&P 500 Index. A spokesman for the fund didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nMr Munger said in October that Valeant's model of acquiring rights to treatments and jacking up prices was \"similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education.\" Mr Ackman responded later, faulting Mr Buffett and Mr Munger for their holding in Coca-Cola Co. The soft drink maker has \"probably done more to create obesity, diabetes on a global basis than any other company in the world,\" he said. Coca-Cola is among the largest and most successful stock investments at Berkshire.\n\nMr Munger, a billionaire who is also chairman of Daily Journal Corp in Los Angeles, said this year that it may not have been smart to publicly criticse Valeant, but that he felt obligated to speak out against what he sees as abusive practices.\n\n\"I couldn't resist calling attention to it,\" Mr Munger said in February at Daily Journal's annual meeting. \"These crazy false values and this crazy excess is bad morals and it's bad policy. It's bad for the nation. It's just bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nValeant attempted to put the worst of its problems behind it on Friday, announcing a shakeup of its board and filing a long-awaited annual report where it promised significant changes to strategy and better oversight of executives. Mr Pearson is to be replaced by Joe Papa in May. Valeant said in a filing that Mr Papa's pay will amount to about US$67.4 million in cash, options and restricted stock for this year.\n\n\"In the last five weeks, we've recruited a phenomenal CEO and we're going to work very hard to make Valeant a leader in the industry,\" Mr Ackman said on Saturday in a phone interview. Mr Ackman first invested in Valeant in the first quarter of 2015 and joined the board last month.\n\nThe drugmaker's stock plunge and Mr Pearson's departure killed his chances of realising an unusually big incentive: In January 2015, Valeant arranged for a potential payday of US$2.66 billion for the CEO if the shares rose enough.\n\nA grant the company disclosed for the first time on Friday would have given Mr Pearson 2.25 million shares if Valeant reached at least US$1,181.81 on three specific dates between October 2019 and April 2020.\n\nValeant's troubles began with a controversy over increasing the price of two cardiac drugs by 525 per cent and 212 per cent. The drugmaker has said that Mr Schiller had engaged in improper conduct that led to financial misstatements. Mr Schiller refused to resign from the board and denied the allegation.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

OCBC also took a hit from lower contributions from its insurance unit Great Eastern, due to unrealised mark-to-market losses on its bond and equity portfolio.\n\nThe second Singapore bank to report Q1 earnings, OCBC said on Friday that net profit fell 14 per cent to S$856 million from a year ago, missing forecasts. The bank said its smaller profit reflected lower insurance income and a rise in bad debt charges.\n\nFive analysts polled by Reuters had an average forecast of S$934 million while Bloomberg's average (also from five analysts) was S$899 million.\n\nSmaller rival United Overseas Bank (UOB), which posted results on Thursday, saw its Q1 profit fall 4.4 per cent. DBS will report its earnings next Tuesday.\n\nOCBC said bad debt allowances more than doubled to S$167 million from S$64 million and the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio surged to one per cent from 0.6 per cent, mainly from its oil-and-gas (O&G) exposure. Loans fell one per cent to S$208.1 billion.\n\nNPLs increased from a year ago, reflecting economic conditions and the significant decline in commodity prices - which particularly contributed to the stress in the O&G support services portfolio, the bank said.\n\n\"Market is indeed weakening. The oil-and-gas issue has not broadened, but deepened,\" said Samuel Tsien, OCBC chief executive, at an earnings briefing. He noted that of OCBC's higher one per cent NPL rate, 0.43 per cent was from its O&G exposure. Other bad debts were from consumer and small businesses, like trading companies, he added.\n\nAs at March 31, 2016, the absolute amount of NPLs was S$2.15 billion - up from S$1.97 billion in the previous quarter and S$1.35 billion a year ago. Most of the year-on-year increase in NPLs were from the downgrades of a number of large corporate accounts in the O&G support services sector, which required their loan repayment terms to be restructured.\n\nMr Tsien said OCBC's oil-and- gas exposure was S$12.4 billion, or 6 per cent of total loans.\n\nThe offshore services sector made up 47 per cent of the O&G exposure or S$5.8 billion. Within offshore services, 15 per cent was classified as NPLs, or S$870 million.\n\nOverall, oil & gas NPLs totalled S$897 million, or an NPL rate of 0.43 per cent. The O&G NPL rate worsened from 0.39 per cent or S$800 million in Q4 2015.\n\nOf the total amount, 61 per cent (S$547 million in loans) is still being actively serviced, including 58 per cent (S$520 million in loans) still servicing interest as well as some principal.\n\nMr Tsien said oil prices have improved from around US$30 per barrel in February to US$40, and some customers are able to negotiate longer-term charters. Most customers are part of larger groups and able to pull in resources, he added.\n\nOn loans, his assessment is that growth will be \"quite subdued\" given lower growth in Malaysia, Greater China and Singapore. Indonesia is the only bright spot with expected 5 per cent growth this year, he said.\n\nMr Tsien noted that Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has been in power for some 18 months now, has increasingly been able to implement his policies. This will result in more private investments, leading to higher loan demand.\n\nOCBC NISP, the bank's Indonesian unit, grew loans 22 per cent while net profit rose 18 per cent to S$39 million, contributing 5 per cent to the group.\n\nOCBC Malaysia's loans rose 6 per cent but net profit fell 10 per cent to S$76 million. Its profit contribution to the group was 9 per cent.\n\nMr Tsien said he is cautious on the outlook for Malaysia but \"fundamentally, it's a country we like\" and will continue to invest in.\n\nOCBC Wing Hang, the group's Hong Kong bank, posted a 15 per cent fall in net profit to S$66 million. Greater China customer loans fell 9 per cent due to lower trade loans, and a weaker US dollar and Hong Kong dollar.\n\nAnother poor performer was the bank's insurance unit Great Eastern. Its earnings fell S$108 million or 59 per cent from a year ago to S$73 million.\n\nRegional economies are sluggish but Mr Tsien noticed that Singapore companies are more willing to invest overseas, particularly in London, New York, Los Angeles and Sydney. Lately, he has seen movement to Japan.\n\nHe said the investments overseas are in the hospitality sector, hotels, student housing, commercial buildings and private homes - all in cities where OCBC has a presence.\n\nAsked about OCBC's exposure in London and the impact should the UK vote in June to leave the European Union, Mr Tsien said it would be immaterial as the bank's business there is banking South-east Asian customers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In a poll vote, about 29 per cent of the shares present supported, and about 71 per cent were against, proposals to replace the four current directors with nominees of the minority shareholders.\n\nThere were occasional bouts of shouting and name calling between shareholders from both sides of the issue, as well as pleas for the directors to do more.\n\nLawyer Lim Chee San, who was one of three director nominees by the minority shareholders, repeatedly asked the board to explain why it had to take on highly dilutive convertible financing when its core subsidiary had sufficient funding.\n\nMagnus chairman Kushairi bin Zaidel told investors that it was difficult for the company to raise money in other ways, and Magnus needed the cash so that it could make further investments and avert an erosion of the stock.\n\nBut even Mr Kushairi was confused at times about the details of the convertibles, which carry a structure colloquially known as \"death spiral\" because of their substantial dilutive effect on the underlying stock. Mr Kushairi wrongly asserted during the meeting that Magnus was contractually bound to issue the final S$15 million of the S$35 million convertible deal. Mr Ho and Mr Lim then corrected him; the issuance of the last tranche is Magnus's choice.\n\nMr Ho told shareholders that the company has \"plans to draw down\" that last S$15 million.\n\nThe minority shareholders, who had requisitioned the meeting in March, had been expecting to lose their bid after Malaysian businessman and politician Lee Chin Cheh emerged as a 25 per cent shareholder on Monday. Mr Lee, who bought a 22 per cent stake from the fund that held the Magnus convertibles, had told Mr Ho that he supported the current board and management. Mr Lee has, however, kept mum on his plans for the company.\n\nWhen asked how Mr Lee came into the picture, Mr Ho said that he had been introduced to Mr Lee in the past \"couple of months\" by Magnus minority shareholder Mohammed Wira Dani bin Abdul Daim.\n\n\"I spoke to Dato Wira ... a former controlling shareholder of the company. I said to him, well, we need some investors and we need some supporting shareholders. So he introduced Mr Lee Chin Cheh,\" Mr Ho said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Ho clarified to The Business Times that it was a \"casual\" introduction.\n\nMr Wira is also a director of GCM Resources, a coal exploration company listed on London's AIM.\n\nOn Thursday, Magnus announced that it had agreed to pay \u00a3510,000 (S$1 million) in cash for convertibles issued by GCM that would raise Magnus's stake in GCM from about 15 per cent to about 21 per cent if converted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

US and South Korean officials have expressed concern the North could attempt a fifth nuclear test in a show of strength ahead of its Workers' Party congress, which begins on May 6.\n\nNorth Korea test-fired what appeared to be two intermediate range ballistic missiles on Thursday, but both failed, according to the US military.\n\nOn Friday, the White House said it was still in talks with its close ally South Korea and that the system, if installed, would not threaten other countries.\n\n\"Those discussions are ongoing,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.\n\n\"That equipment would be oriented toward the threat that is posed by North Korea, not oriented toward China or Russia.\"\n\nSpeaking at joint press briefing with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi earlier on Friday called on the United States to respect \"legitimate concerns\" of China and Russia over the missile system.\n\n\"This move goes beyond the defensive needs of the relevant countries. If it is deployed it will directly impact China's and Russia's respective strategic security,\" Mr Wang said.\n\n\"Not only does it threaten the resolution of the peninsula nuclear issue, it quite possibly could pour oil on the fire of an already tense situation, and even destroy strategic equilibrium on the peninsula.\"\n\nNorth Korea's actions should not be used as an excuse to make moves that would escalate tensions, especially the US deployment of an anti-missile system, Mr Lavrov said, according to an interpretation in Chinese.\n\nNorth Korea's drive to develop a nuclear weapons capability has angered China, Pyongyang's sole major diplomatic and economic supporter. But Beijing fears THAAD and its radar have a range that would extend into China.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has said Beijing would not allow war and chaos to break out on the Korean peninsula.\n\nMr Earnest gave no timing on when talks with South Korea may concluded but added that \"the United States is prepared to invest resources in keeping them safe.\"\n\nNorth and South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, rather than a treaty. The North routinely threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

The yen also jumped against the euro.\n\nThe spike provoked speculation about possible intervention by the Japanese authorities to stem the rise, but sources told The Business Times that beyond small \"smoothing\" exercises, Japan is unlikely to attempt any real intervention \"this side of 100 to the dollar\".\n\nApart from US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's apparent warning to Japan during the recent G-20 finance ministers' meeting in Washington against making moves to depreciate the yen, analysts say that \"fundamentals\" are working against a cheaper Japanese currency. They point to the fact that Japan's current account surplus on the nation's balance of payments has moved into repeated monthly surpluses, which tends to strengthen the yen as it implies increasing capital inflows.\n\nFor now, Tokyo has shifted its stance in favour of fiscal stimulus over further monetary easing, prominent Japan analyst Jesper Koll told BT.\n\nFrom here, fiscal policy is going to be key, said the chief executive of investment group Wisdom Tree, Japan, in Tokyo. \"There was no way the BOJ would write a blank cheque by raising QE (quantitative easing) before a concrete funding project was finalised.\"\n\nMr Koll added that the BOJ's decision on Thursday was aimed at showing its confidence that the drastic measures it took in late January - that is, the negative interest rates - were working as designed. \"Adding new measures at this stage would be tantamount to signalling weakness of conviction on the part of policymakers,\" he said.\n\nOthers say that the BOJ will hold its fire at least until the Policy Board's next scheduled meeting in June. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said in an analysis this week that it believed the BOJ would ease policy then.\n\nThis way, the BOJ could gain more fire-power and depress the yen significantly if it moves at the same time as - though in the opposite direction from - the Federal Reserve, which the EIU expects would sanction another interest rate increase at its June meeting.\n\nThe BOJ \"would like to see the yen weaken, which would help stimulate economic activity and push up inflation, but its decision to adopt a negative interest rate failed to reverse the course of the yen\", said the EIU.\n\nJapan's former \"Mr Yen\" Eisuke Sakakibara, a former vice-finance minister for international affairs, maintained recently that the yen was likely to settle nearer the 100-to-the-dollar level than the peak of near 125, which it hit late last year.\n\nIntervention to stem the yen's rise would not have any lasting effect unless it is done through concerted intervention by the central banks and monetary authorities of the G-7 group, and that is unlikely unless the yen shoots up quickly through 100 to the dollar, Mr Sakakibara has suggested.\n\nChief market economist Daisuke Karakama of Mizuho Bank in Tokyo said in a recent report that \"the adjustment has just kicked off\". He predicted that the yen might go to around 95 to the dollar, roughly where it was when BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda took over the helm three years ago.\n\nTohru Sasaki, the chief foreign exchange strategist at JP Morgan Chase Bank in Tokyo, suggested meanwhile that the yen could settle at 100 by the end of this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Indofood said the biological assets revaluation gain was due to the net changes in the fair values of agricultural produce.\n\nNet profit was also boosted by 121 billion rupiah in foreign exchange gains as the rupiah strengthened against the US dollar.\n\nExcluding biological assets revaluation gains and foreign exchange gains, the company made a core net loss after tax of 68 billion rupiah, Indofood said.\n\nRevenue rose 18 per cent to 3.1 trillion rupiah from 2.7 trillion rupiah a year ago, due to higher crude palm oil sales to external parties and stronger sales by the edible oils and fats division.\n\nGross profit was down 13 per cent to 534 billion rupiah due to lower average selling prices of palm products and rubber.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses dipped slightly to 210 billion rupiah, while selling and distribution expenses rose 44 per cent to 134 billion rupiah. Finance expenses were maintained at 166 billion rupiah.\n\nLosses deepened for its sugar cane mill joint venture in Brazil to 48 billion rupiah from 29 billion rupiah a year ago, as electricity generation prices fell and there were foreign currency losses due to loans denominated in US dollars. Other operating expenses and income tax expenses also rose.\n\nThe company's Indonesia planted area remained unchanged at around 300,000 hectares at end-March, with 246,000 of planted oil palm and 55,000 of other crops like rubber, sugar cane, timber, cocoa and tea.\n\nIn Brazil, planted sugar cane area decreased by around 3,000 hectares to 50,000 hectares at end-March compared to three months ago, mainly due to third party replanting in progress.\n\nThe company said key strategies in 2016 include prioritising capital expenditure on immature plantings, and expanding milling facilities for organic growth.\n\nNet asset value per share was S$0.896 at end-March, up slightly from S$0.888 at end-2015, based on 9,830 rupiah per Singapore dollar.\n\nIndofood ended Friday trading 0.5 Singapore cent lower at S$0.535.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We believe over time, regionalisation beyond Asean would need to improve and a stronger traction in non-interest margin (NIM) away from loan-related activities would be needed to prompt a re-rating for the bank.\n\nUOB is more Singapore-centric compared to peers, with 53 per cent and 48 per cent of its loans and deposits being Sing dollar-based respectively. While this is not necessarily a weakness, it would remain a point of contention when peers are able to reap better contribution from overseas operations in the future.\n\nExpect loan momentum to stay soft and NIM to remain flattish from here. Total credit costs are still guided at 32 basis points. There is more than sufficient excess general allowances as a buffer to manage its credit costs.

Taxis may remain under pressure amid rising Uber/Grab competition.\n\nSMRT's rental business, which accounts for 70 per cent of operating profit, witnessed a quarter-on-quarter decline in profit despite registering a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter rise in revenue.\n\nRail reforms are still work in progress. Management stated that it is making progress on the transition to new rail financing framework. We think rail reforms could be implemented by 2019 and estimate that the sale of rail assets at a 10 per cent discount to book value could add S$0.50 to our fair-value estimate.\n\nSATS\n\nBuy\n\nCIMB | April 28\n\nTarget price:\n\nS$4.61\n\nApril 29 close:\n\nS$4.10\n\nWE left the 2016 Tourism Industry Conference \"Sharpening Our Strategies Towards Quality Tourism\" by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) feeling positive.

Though Standard Chartered has a \"fantastic\" ethical culture, \"there was a looseness\" to the way the bank was managed during the bank's years of outperformance and \"little mistakes got amplified,\" Mr Winters said in a April 26 interview with Bloomberg Television in London, speaking generally about the firm.\n\nA spokesman for Standard Chartered declined to comment. Standard Chartered entered into a deferred prosecution agreement as part of the 2012 US sanctions settlement and has been under the scrutiny of an independent monitor.\n\nIt said in 2014 that it \"accepts responsibility for and regrets\" deficiencies in its anti-money laundering surveillance.\n\nSeparately, Mr Winters, 54, is attempting to unwind the damage caused by predecessor Peter Sands' revenue-led expansion across emerging markets, which left the bank riddled with bad loans when the commodity market crashed and growth stalled from China to India.\n\nSince joining in June with a mandate to turn around the struggling lender, Mr Winters has picked a new management team, sold 19 businesses and identified US$100 billion of risky assets he wants to restructure or exit.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

As of Friday, the total market capitalisation of some 763 Singapore stocks was S$847.8 billion, only 0.05 per cent higher than a month ago.\n\nSingapore's key benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) closed 2.38 points lower from a month ago at 2,838.52 on Friday, the last trading day of April. It was traded at 12.14 times the 12-month forward earnings, based on Bloomberg data.\n\nMarket analysts are expecting further pullbacks in May, a traditionally quiet month after the lacklustre corporate earnings reporting season and as many stocks turn ex-dividend.\n\nDBS Group research head Janice Chua noted that first-quarter earnings reports have been largely disappointing, prompting a number of downgrades in ratings or target prices either based on valuation or financial performance. \"We don't think the market recovery in April was sustainable in terms of valuation. The current STI level is fair and without earnings upside, it is hard to justify a re-rating of the market beyond the 3,000-point level since macro indicators are weak if you look at GDP growth this year.\"\n\nThe direction of the US dollar against the Singapore dollar will be important in deciding where Singapore stocks may be heading next month, she added.\n\nJudging from the trading of Federal funds futures, the implied probability is 12 per cent for a Fed rate hike to take place at the June meeting and 26.1 per cent for the hike to take place in July, Bloomberg data shows.\n\nIn April, the biggest gainers in dollar terms were Wilmar International, Hongkong Land, Thai Beverage and Singtel, while the biggest losers included the Jardine group, Keppel Corp, Sembcorp Marine, UOB and OCBC.\n\nBy sector, companies in the hotels and restaurants category rose 3 per cent overall, followed by 2.8 per cent on average for services companies and 2.6 per cent for property counters. Recent debutants on the Catalist, China Star Food and Acromec, held up their gains since listing, closing 27.6 per cent and 75 per cent higher than their respective listing prices as at April 29.\n\nDuring the month, there were also rotational plays into stocks that looked like potential privatisation candidates, following the bid by OSIM International's chairman and chief executive officer Ron Sim to privatise the firm. Among them were PACC Offshore Services Holdings, up 4.2 per cent over a month to S$682.5 million; GuocoLand, up 2.8 per cent to S$2.19 billion; and Wing Tai, up 6.5 per cent to S$1.49 billion in market capitalisation.\n\nUOB KayHian dealing director Chan Tuck Sing felt that notwithstanding the looming Fed rate hikes, as long as absolute interest rates stay low in the US, Europe and Japan, a major market correction is unlikely when there remains a decent spread between borrowing costs on the one hand, and yields from corporate dividends and Reits' distributions on the other. \"There may be a bit of correction if the Fed hikes rates in June but overall, we may be ending the year higher,\" Mr Chan projected.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The French manufacturer's five-door hatchback is an entry-level model with attractive pricing and fuel economy.\n\nIntroduced in 2013, it has been refreshed with new head and tail lamps. There are some frills such as keyless entry and exit, a push button engine start, electric parking brake and a touchscreen. But that's it and the grey cabin borders on depressing.\n\nThere are three tube meters in the instrument binnacle with functional but dull monochrome digital displays for the speedometer, tachometer, and fuel level and range.\n\nThe touchscreen in the middle is full-colour but only when playing your own music. Otherwise, there is only a choice of blue or red highlights for the radio and trip computer displays.\n\nHowever, the lack of equipment will soon be forgotten because the drive may leave your jaw scraping the floor mat. The Citroen C4 used to have a 1.6-litre engine mated to the head-jerking six-speed automated manual gearbox that European urbanites are enamoured of. Thankfully, though, this robotised EGS gearbox has made way for a silkier six-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter in the Citroen C4 1.2L PureTech. The 1.2L refers to the mighty mouse that is the 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine from the PSA Peugeot Citroen group.\n\nIt may be small but it is punchy, with an eye-popping 230 Newton-metres of torque available early. This works well for the relatively light C4 at 1,240 kg. There is even a sport mode, with an S button beside the gear stick, which when depressed, delays upshifts for better progress. The steering wheel does not come with shift paddles though, but the gear lever does a good job of changing manually.\n\nZero to 100 kmh will take more than 10 seconds, but zero to 60 kmh is more than adequate, and the C4 is a brisk performer around town. But most impressive about this little Citroen is its ride quality. At just 4.3 metres long with a 2,608 mm wheelbase, it cruises with a smoothness and balance that even some mid-size sedans cannot match.\n\nAnd this is just a simple suspension set-up consisting of front MacPherson struts and a rear torsion beam. But it is so well-tuned that it not only produces excellent ride comfort but rather good body control in fast corners too, with a steering that provides nice feedback.\n\nInterior space is good for those in front but being a sub-compact hatch means rear legroom is only so-so.\n\nBut those who appreciate a good ride and drive will relish this cool Citroen.\n\nSPECS\n\nCitroen C4 1.2L PureTech\n\nEngine\n\n: 1,199 cc 3-cyl turbocharged\n\nGearbox\n\n: 6-speed automatic transmission\n\nMax power\n\n: 130 hp @ 5,500 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n: 230 Nm @ 1,750 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n: 11.5 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n: 197 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n: 113 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n: S$18,000\n\nPrice\n\n: S$106,988 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\n: Cycle & Carriage France\n\nTel\n\n: 6479-2792\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two days earlier, a report indicated economic growth slowed in the first quarter.\n\nInvestors' muted reaction to economic data this week may suggest the currency's direction is being driven more by their view on the outcome of the June 23 vote, as recent polls show pro-EU Britons have taken the lead, following the official start of the campaign on April 15.\n\nThe pound strengthened against most of its major peers this month, having dropped in February to its lowest level since 2009 versus the US dollar after the referendum was announced.\n\n\"The only thing right now being in focus for sterling is the probabilities for the different outcomes in the referendum,\" said Richard Falkenhall, a currency strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm.\n\n\"Last week we started to see signs again that the 'remain' side increased the lead over the 'leave' alternative.

Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often get because of its history of delivering outsize growth.\n\nFor the first quarter, which ended on March 31, Amazon reported net income of US$513 million, or US$1.07 a share, up from a loss of US$57 million, or 12 US cents a share, in the same period a year ago.\n\nRevenue rose to US$29.13 billion from US$22.72 billion a year ago.\n\nAmazon's share price jumped more than 12 per cent in after-hours trading after the results were released. Investors were happy to see the company show profits after the disappointing run of reports from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Intel.\n\nThe results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 US cents a share and revenue of US$27.98 billion.\n\nFor the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology firms. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to US$1.5 billion from a year earlier.\n\nThe biggest source of the company's profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than US$10 billion a year in revenue. AWS, as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for startups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity rather than run their own hardware and software.\n\nCloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for AWS more than tripled in the quarter to US$604 million.\n\nThe profits from AWS represented 56 per cent of Amazon's total operating income, even though the US$2.57 billion in revenue from AWS - up 64 per cent from a year earlier - amounted to less than 9 per cent of total revenue.\n\nOn a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service.\n\nIn a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment - hardware devices - though with the lack of detail that has often characterised Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock.\n\nLast year, Amazon reached US$100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales.\n\nOnline sales in 2016 are expected to reach about US$385 billion in the United States, or 8 per cent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm.\n\nAmazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company's retail sales in North America jumped 27 per cent to almost US$17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 per cent to US$9.57 billion.

For sure, it is an important transit point for imitation goods, but it is not on what the OECD calls the list of top 15 \"provenance economies in terms of their propensity to export counterfeit products\".\n\nIn other words, phony products do not make up a big chunk of Singapore's exports, unlike places such as Hong Kong, China, Turkey and Greece; the study suggests that Singapore's economy is geared more to the production of genuine goods of high value, rather than knockoffs.\n\nThe OECD estimates that the global market for fake goods is worth US$461 billion in 2013 - or 2.5 per cent of total world trade.\n\nThe agency also suggests that countries with strong intellectual property (IP) frameworks tend to be more successful in keeping the trade in bogus goods from flourishing.\n\nThe Republic's IP protection has been ranked by the World Economic Forum and the US Global Intellectual Property Center to be among the world's best.\n\nEconomic agencies here approached by The Business Times for comment either said they were not the appropriate spokesman for this issue, or did not respond.\n\nThe OECD study, drawn from raw data culled from more than 500,000 fake goods confiscated globally between 2011 and 2013 by the global customs community, says that while virtually all countries are culprits, China is overwhelmingly the world's largest producer of such products, which range from footwear, leather bags, luxury watches to toys, medicine, spare parts and foods such as strawberries and coconut oil.\n\nThe study notes that middle-income and emerging economies both tend to have sufficient infrastructure, productive and technological capabilities to enable large-scale trade. \"Yet, they may not have developed sound institutional frameworks, including IP-related legislation and enforcement practices.\"\n\nThe study declares that any product for which intellectual property adds economic value and creates a price differential is fair game for counterfeiters.\n\nAmong the faked goods confiscated, footwear made up the biggest seizure, followed by clothing and leather bags and wallets; luxury watches were just as exposed to copying.\n\nThe hardest hit brands include Rolex (watches), Nike (shoes), Ray Ban (eyewear) and Louis Vuitton (bags).\n\nThe industries most hit by the proliferation of fakes are mostly based in the well-off countries - the US, Italy, France, Switzerland, Japan and Germany.\n\nBut even emerging economies such as China are also victims. The study warns: \"All innovative companies that rely on intellectual property to support their global development strategy are at risk, whether they are in developed or emerging economies.\"\n\nCounterfeiting and piracy are a menace to innovation, which beats at the heart of any productive, forward-looking, knowledge-based economy, the study says.\n\nCounterfeiting, beyond causing leaks in sales revenue for the legitimate businesses, can have life-threatening consequences, evidenced by the knock-offs in pharmaceuticals, machine spare parts and toys of poor quality.\n\nThe threat is growing. The study says the revival of global trade after the 2009 recession, more market openings, globalisation of value chains and booming e-commerce have boosted the trade in spurious goods in recent years.\n\nAnd detecting the flow of faked goods has become trickier and more costly with the rise of the Internet and e-commerce, it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Maybe it's the radical fastback styling or perhaps a secret anti-ageing cream/wax. But the British carmaker's flagship limousine has remained surprisingly youthful, and a mild facelift has resulted in subtle differences only.\n\nIn front, there is a more upright grille and full LED headlamps that sport the \"Double J\" daytime running light design. The LED tail lights are updated too.\n\nInside, the changes are slightly more significant.\n\nThe 12.3-inch TFT virtual instrument panel has always had a choice of themes and colours but now it also offers a full-screen navigation display. This means a map instead of meters directly in front of the driver.\n\nThe infotainment system is new too, and the Jaguar touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard has a different look and feel with improved response speed.\n\nDynamically, electric power-assisted steering or Epas also changes the way the XJ steers.\n\nThe old hydraulic system has been replaced by a more efficient electric steering that is lighter but sufficiently reactive. Turn the rotary gear selector from D to S and the steering feels heavier and less \"loose\".\n\nBut it still does not have quite the same well-oiled consistency of the old set-up. Nevertheless, it allows the big cat to show off its agility. The XJ's all-aluminium body makes it one of the lightest cars in its class. With a 3.0-litre supercharged petrol engine driving the rear wheels, it is nimble despite being more than five metres long.\n\nIn Jaguar XJ 3.0 V6 LWB form, the big sedan has a long wheelbase - 3,157 mm or an additional 134 mm over the standard wheelbase car. This takes its overall length to 5,255 mm. Yet, it weighs in at about 1,765 kg, or similar to a mid-size European saloon.\n\nThe V6's 340 hp and 450 Nm is transmitted to the rear wheels through Jaguar's perfectly tuned eight-speed ZF automatic transmission.\n\nThe gearbox shifts more rapidly than most conventional cars with a torque converter. In manual mode, you can pull the left steering wheel-mounted shift paddle and it downshifts immediately without complaint.\n\nThe XJ's suspension system consists of steel coil springs in front with rear air suspension. This is paired with adaptive dampers not only for confident handling but excellent ride comfort, even when rolling on 19-inch wheels. The LWB XJ comes with a rear seat package as standard. A centre armrest houses the multimedia remote as well as the front and rear seat controls for the individual electric seats, which have been recontoured for enhanced comfort. To complete the comfy cocoon effect, there are three massage programmes and rear and side window blinds. Because its combination of comfort, handling and styling still remains relevant after all these years, this old girl is obviously a good old girl.\n\nSPECS\n\nJaguar XJ 3.0 V6 LWB\n\nEngine\n\n: 2,995cc V6 supercharged\n\nGearbox\n\n: 8-speed automatic transmission\n\nMax power\n\n: 340 hp @ 6,500 rpm\n\nMax torque\n\n: 450 Nm @ 3,500-5,000 rpm\n\n0-100 kmh\n\n: 5.9 secs\n\nTop speed\n\n: 250 kmh\n\nCO2 emissions\n\n: 211 g/km\n\nAverage OMV\n\n: S$105,000\n\nPrice from\n\n: S$430,000 (with COE)\n\nDistributor\n\n: Wearnes Automotive\n\nTel\n\n: 6378-2626\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That beat the 71-cent average analyst estimate.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings topped expectations by a wide margin and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance to US$3.65 billion to US$3.70 billion, from an earlier range of US$3.6 billion to $3.65 billion. \"It was a good quarter with demand picking back up with recruiters and advertisers,\" said James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness Crespi Hardt & Co.\n\nEarlier this year, LinkedIn said it miscalculated some strategic moves and that the company would grow more slowly than expected, forcing some analysts to reconsider their positive opinions on the stock. That cut its market value almost in half and the shares had not recovered much.\n\nThis quarter, the company said a redesign of its mobile apps encouraged people to spend more time on the service. First-quarter revenue from its Talent Solutions business, the company's main moneymaker, rose 41 per cent to US$558 million as the company sought out large corporate customers that pay to track down potential job candidates. The company said this recruiting service can generate billions more by wooing new clients in markets like healthcare and staffing.\n\nLinkedIn also saw a record number of job seekers on its service, up 50 per cent from the same period a year earlier.

Negative growth in China has sent shockwaves across the rest of Asia, casting doubts on the region's economic outlook in 2016.\n\nProductivity improvements are seen as one of the most important solutions to reverse slowing economic growth. Increases in productivity allow businesses to produce greater output for the same level of input, resulting in higher GDP while keeping costs low. However, many business leaders have mistakenly associated improvements to productivity with a reduction in costs.\n\nA recent report by real-estate investment firm CBRE found that many organisations across Asia are under pressure to drive down costs and are doing so by reducing the size of workspaces. In Hong Kong, India and China, workspaces have shrunk from 100 square feet per desk to 50-60 square feet per desk over the last decade. This is nearly half that in Europe and the US. While this reduction in workspaces has lowered the overhead costs, further reductions can lead to a dangerous drop in performance and retention.\n\nInstead of focusing on bottom lines, business leaders should look at improving productivity. A simple way is by optimising the office environment which impacts employees' productivity and well-being. Today, one of the main culprits for decreased productivity lay ominously overhead: lighting. Research has demonstrated a significant connection between light and circadian rhythms, the \"built-in clocks\" that govern our cycles of sleep and waking, stimulation and relaxation. When circadian cycles are disrupted due to too little or too much light at the wrong time of the day, the body releases melatonin which disrupts sleep cycles, affecting work performance and leading to health issues. The ability to balance and adjust the types and amount of light to be emitted throughout the day and for different durations can have positive effects on circadian cycles.\n\nPerfecting the balance\n\nLight goes beyond illumination. When used correctly, light brings better productivity and health benefits to employees. Very cool white light enhances productivity, while artificial light that emulates natural daylight rhythm aid in improving mood, energy and alertness. This is the reason why brainstorming rooms in offices should ideally be fitted with very cool white lights to invigorate employees, while conference rooms should use middle tones to exude an inviting ambience while keeping workers motivated.\n\nBut in today's increasingly urban Asia, land is scarce and real estate costs continue to spiral upwards. There is limited amount of space and resource to cater for purpose-built facilities within offices, ie brainstorming rooms with very cool white lights, creative spaces with warm white lights and conference rooms with middle-tone lights. However, lighting technologies have evolved over the years and it is now possible to use light to creatively switch between a variety of ambiences throughout the workday, making the office an ideal place to think, create and collaborate. Scene setting and timeline-based dimming schedules have also enabled offices to enjoy optimal lighting experiences with a press of a button or at pre-set timings. A brainstorming room can be turned into a conference room in a matter of seconds.\n\nDon't let the office become an occupational hazard\n\nAsia's workforce has changed. Young millennials are joining the workforce every day, and employees from the older generations are delaying their retirement. The office is now a diverse and multi-generational community. This new demographic has fuelled numerous discussions around resolving and managing generational differences, but little has been said about the suitability of work environments for older populations.\n\nAs people age, they experience neurodegeneration in their eyes. Less light gets to the retina to stimulate the nerves, which means that older employees will require about three to four times more illumination than their younger peers. This level of illumination, however, will be damaging to younger employees, resulting in eye strain and even headaches. Building authorities and business leaders must re-evaluate office and building lighting to cater for today's diverse workforce.\n\nEmployees today are already spending longer than usual hours at work but it is not necessarily paying off, and can have detrimental effects on employees' mental and physical health. According to the Morgan McKinley Working Hours Survey 2015, 82 per cent of professionals in Singapore feel they are working longer than their contractual hours but only 28 per cent believe they are more productive during these extra hours. Elsewhere in the region, only 39 per cent of employees in China, 37 per cent in Hong Kong and 36 per cent in Japan felt they were productive during the extra hours.\n\nWhile not ideal, the reality is that offices are becoming a second home to many. There is no doubt that reporting managers must help to balance their employees' worklife balance, but higher management must look at ways to improve productivity as a way to reduce long working hours. Most importantly, if employees are going to spend a better part of their day at work, then there is an impetus to create an ideal work environment for them.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Separately, 90 per cent is also a ownership threshold where a stock can be suspended from trading as public float has fallen below 10 per cent.\n\nCredit Suisse is acting on behalf of Mr Sim in his privatisation bid. It said that the offeror, a special purpose vehicle owned by Mr Sim called Vision Three, can exercise its legal right of compulsory acquisition once it receives acceptances of 90 per cent of shares that it did not own pre-offer, other than those already held by the offeror, its related corporations or their respective nominees. As Vision Three is a newly set-up vehicle, it did not own any shares prior to making the offer on March 7. Mr Sim's shares do not count as a \"related corporation\", said corporate lawyer Robson Lee, partner of Gibson Dunn.\n\nAs at 5pm on Thursday, the offeror has received valid acceptances of 13.54 per cent.

These assets will then be leased to SMRT.\n\nSo far, SBS Transit's Downtown Line is the only line under this framework. The government introduced the plan in 2010.\n\nAnalysts have noted that SMRT had revealed more details about the NRFF in its FY16 financial report that was issued on Thursday.\n\nDeutsche Bank, for example, in a note issued on Thursday, said that SMRT had finally clarified in the report that under the NRFF, \"SMRT will become asset light\", and that it \"will pay a licence charge to LTA for the right to operate these lines\".\n\n\"There seems to be good progress on the negotiations in transiting to the NRFF,\" wrote Deutsche Bank. It maintained a \"buy\" on SMRT's counter, with S$2.42 as the target price.\n\nThat Mr Kuek talked about the fare-revenue risk that the train operator shoulders under the NRFF on Friday was another sign of progress in negotiations, said analysts.\n\nThe significance of the comment eluded some, however.\n\n\"How does it make sense to have the government shoulder all costs of building and maintaining the infrastructure, and let the train operator earn margins at no cost?\" said RHB analyst Shekhar Jaiswal, who was at the briefing.\n\nRail operations are SMRT's biggest revenue source. This was S$681 million in FY16, a 4.1 per cent increase.\n\nYet it was also the only segment that posted a drop in profit. This was S$7.4 million, a 22.5 per cent fall. Excluding a tax refund, it would have been a loss of S$9.6 million.\n\nSMRT spent S$308 million in FY16 on rail maintenance, a 12.4 per cent increase. This sum is also a quarter of the group's FY16 total operational expenditure, which was S$1.2 billion, a 5.4 per cent increase.\n\nGroup total revenue was S$1.4 billion in FY16, a 6.2 per cent increase.\n\nExpenditure on rail maintenance will continue, said Mr Kuek.\n\nSMRT is upgrading its signalling system and third-rail system, while replacing sleepers and boosting power capacity for the North-South and East-West train systems. They will be completed by 2019. By then, the lines will be \"virtually new\" systems, Mr Kuek said.\n\nThe bottom line for rail operations should also improve then. \"Once we complete these projects, we will be able to extract some productivity savings, as well as bring repairs and maintenance to a more sustainable level,\" said the CEO.\n\nSMRT's share price rose 3.38 per cent, or S$0.05, to close at S$1.530 on Friday amid a broader Straits Times Index retreat.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A day spent reflecting on your workplace environment? Or a moment to commemorate those who campaigned for better working conditions and employee welfare?\n\nWhatever the case, Labour Day carries different connotations for each individual, but it is still an important moment for us to reflect on our work practices today.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Labour Day was a result of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, where trade unions and labour movements championed eight- hour workdays. While workers found increased opportunities for work in mills and factories powered by automation and machinery, many were under strict working conditions and pulling in long hours to keep up with the pace set by the machines. For many, this meant working 10-16 hours a day, six days a week.\n\nWelsh social reformer Robert Owen then developed the concept of the eight-hour day and coined the slogan \"Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest\" - a cause which resonated with many working-class individuals. This proclamation was without the consent of employers, yet demanded by many. It also formed the basis of Labour Day, which is also known as May Day in many countries, where labour movements across the globe continue to champion better workplace environments today.\n\nThe new Industrial Revolution enabled by technology\n\nIn many respects, today is no different from the late 1800s. While mechanisation led to the first Industrial Revolution, technology has evolved so rapidly that we are now in the age of Industrie 4.0, which promotes the computerisation of manufacturing.\n\nCloud and mobility are now the new norm in organisations, while newer technologies such as big data, advanced analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving disruption among organisations. Business leaders are now forced to evaluate and embrace digital transformation as a strategy to empower working professionals, as well as transform their talent, skills and productivity levels.\n\nThis also means the maturation of new technologies has made it possible for workers to be productive anytime, anywhere. Smaller form factors, enhanced mobile connectivity and cloud-based productivity tools mean workers no longer need to be deskbound to get work done.\n\nThis holds true for me as I do find myself dropping into conference calls with my colleagues while on the go, or getting presentations up and running in between spending time with my kids/family. In a digitised, perpetually connected world, we all seem to be in the grip of an unshakeable, always-on mentality. In fact, it makes me and many of my peers wonder: is Owen's eight-hour-day concept still relevant in today's day and age?\n\nEight-hour workdays, or work-life integration?\n\nThe eight-hour-day concept was instrumental in driving a new world order when it was first mooted. Increasing globalisation, technology proliferation and a connected workforce, however, have given rise to a new era of work which Microsoft dubs the New World of Work.\n\nIn a recent Microsoft survey with 5,000 employees across 13 markets in Asia, we found that:\n\nThe survey highlights that what is demanded of working professionals has changed; as a result, how people work has also evolved. Working professionals are now working at various times throughout the day and week, are expected to be more responsive, and are also increasingly moving away from being deskbound to working from anywhere and on any device. So my conclusion is: the eight-hour- day concept or a 9-to-5 job is less relevant in many businesses today. We need to promote work policies which adapt to current living needs, where the lines between work and personal life are indeed blurred. New technologies are enablers and empower the workforce of the future.\n\nChampioning the New World of Work\n\nHere at Microsoft, we believe in embracing the new ways in which people are working and empowering them to take control in the New World of Work. Our people are shedding the 9-to-5 mentality and gearing towards adopting work-life integration that they find more rewarding.\n\nTo do this successfully, we focus on three principles that facilitate success in a new era of work: People, Place, and Technology.\n\nFor us, People is about making sure our staff have the ability to work productively in a modern workplace. Our business leaders give them the support they need and lay the groundwork for a culture that promotes dynamic working environments. This is supported by policies that enable flexiwork styles for anyone who needs it - and we do mean anyone.\n\nIn terms of Place, our employees are no longer deskbound and can work anywhere at any time. Our offices are designed to support a collaborative working environment - for example, in Singapore we have incorporated wide open spaces, hot-desking, and collaboration areas with informal settings. Employees at all levels, including senior management, have no designated desks. Employees are encouraged to break down the walls between departments, work across teams, and spend time with people of all levels while also minimising storage and paper use.\n\nThe last piece, and something we do exceptionally well is, Technology. Our professionals are enabled by our cloud-based tools such as Office 365 which let them collaborate and communicate across teams, regardless of where they are and what devices they are using. I see this working especially well with staff who have families - they are able to spend precious moments with family at home, while also being able to dial into work, integrating work with personal life. This level of flexibility is complemented by strong policies and IT to ensure employees are accessing and exchanging important information securely.\n\nOur mandate as business leaders should be to empower our workforce to have more meaningful professional and personal lives. Fixed hours, fixed hierarchies and old technology tools should be discarded to empower our employees to enhance their productivity.\n\nThis Labour Day, as we continue to strive for progress and improved productivity, we must remain mindful of the fact that work is not a place we go to; it is a thing we do. And it is about time we made doing it easier.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The survey covered 1,500 firms across different industries.\n\nAs for manufacturing firms, a small net weighted balance of only one per cent here see better conditions in the period from April to September this year, when compared with the first quarter of 2016.\n\nThis stems from a weighted 15 per cent of them expecting improvement, and 14 per cent who see a deterioration.\n\nThis Economic Development Board (EDB) survey was conducted in March and April.

The ESM has a lending capacity of 500 billion euros (S$765 million).\n\nEurozone countries are also divided on setting up a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS), conceived as the third and last pillar of the banking union.\n\nNational deposit insurance schemes are already in place in EU states to underwrite savings of up to 100,000 euros if domestic lenders fail, as required by EU rules.\n\nBut national schemes may prove insufficient to deal with multiple failures. \"EDIS would make banks better protected if there were larger local shocks,\" Mr Hill said.\n\nDespite strong backing from all EU institutions and many states, the plan is not taking off because of German opposition, as Berlin fears that its wealthier deposit guarantee funds may be used to rescue savers in other countries.

Poet will add more activities for design and product development to be based in DenseLight's Singapore facilities, shared Mr Rodrigues.\n\nFounded in 2000 as a Nanyang Technological University spin-off, DenseLight has developed sensing and lasing technologies that have been deployed in telecommunications and network markets, structural health monitoring, and navigation - globally.\n\nMr Rodrigues said: \"It is highly gratifying to see these investments in human capital and technology now find significant application in the strategies for Singapore's Smart Nation initiatives as well as the world.\"\n\nPee Beng Kong, director of electronics at EDB, described compound semiconductor (used to make photonic chips) as a potential disruptor to the electronics industry, holding the potential to introduce new creative solutions for the consumer, automotive and industrial markets.\n\nHe said: \"(Poet's) local investment and partnership with our research institutes is also a testament to Singapore being a choice location to develop solutions and grow new businesses.\"\n\nSilicon Valley-based Poet, which has a current market capitalisation of about US$296.7 million, had previously announced a collaboration with the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, a unit of A*Star (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), to develop technologies for smart pixels.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed by May 10.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Anti-austerity Sinn Fein won 23 seats.\n\nTogether, the two centre-right parties would have more than enough seats to form a stable government but Fianna Fail has ruled out a formal coalition.\n\nInstead, it had offered to support Fine Gael if agreement could be reached on key policy issues.\n\nAlthough both parties are considered centre-right, their relationship is riven by mistrust and historical enmities dating back to the 1920s Irish civil war.\n\nThe issue of water charges had been a key point of contention in the negotiations amid tensions over the wording of legislation agreed to resolve the situation.\n\nActing transport minister Paschal Donohoe was quoted by the Irish Independent as saying there was agreement across a variety of areas.\n\n\"Intense work will now continue in relation to the text of the agreement between both parties. That will then be shared with the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna Fail and our respective parliamentary parties,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll call it a historic deal when and if it's concluded.\"\n\nThe BBC reported that the deal would last over a period of three budgets and that it would mean Fianna Fail abstaining in key votes, allowing the government to pass important pieces of legislation.\n\nFianna Fail, whose name means \"Warriors of Ireland\", was founded by Eamon de Valera, who was later president from 1959 to 1973.\n\nThe party has its roots in opposition to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which granted Ireland limited independence from Britain and provided for the partition of Northern Ireland, which is still part of the United Kingdom.\n\nFine Gael, meaning \"Tribe of the Irish\", grew out of the group that supported that treaty.\n\nUnder Mr de Valera's leadership, Fianna Fail became Ireland's dominant political force and remained so until 2011, when it suffered an election defeat of historic proportions after a brutal economic crisis and housing crash.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

While 97 per cent of tariff issues had been covered, three per cent - the most challenging, including for farm products, remained and could be some of the last things to deal with.\n\nOther key challenges are on the opening of the EU services sector and better European access to US government procurement projects.\n\n\"Quite substantial work is still ahead of us,\" said Garcia Bercero.\n\nAfter nearly three years of talks, he said progress on access to US government procurement lags other issues, suggesting that Washington needs to make more concessions on allowing European firms to compete equally in contracts from US public authorities.\n\nThe US meanwhile wants to see Europe's services sector opened wider to American companies.\n\nBoth sides said they need to open those doors wider rather than leaving the most politically difficult issues untouched.\n\n\"We shouldn't reserve significant amounts of space to discriminate against each other,\" said Mr Mullaney.\n\nThey also downplayed the affect on their negotiations of critics of free trade deals, including from the US politicians now battling to succeed President Barack Obama; and from the looming referendum in Britain on Brexit, withdrawal from the European Union by a key trading power.\n\n\"This is not an issue which is impacting our negotiations,\" Garcia Bercero said of Brexit.\n\n\"There is a lot of anxiety about globalisation both in Europe and in the United States, and one certainly needs to understand those concerns,\" he added.\n\n\"Trade agreements... are instruments to better manage globalization.\"\n\n\"TTIP gives the United States and European Union the opportunity to write the rules of trade in a way that reflects important values that we share: rules of law, transparency, standards for protecting the environment, workers and consumers,\" said Mr Mullaney.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Sebi hasn't decided on its response, the person said.\n\nWhile Sebi chairman U K Sinha met brokers in Mumbai on April 21, he didn't comment directly on the panel's findings, saying only that Sebi will ensure a \"level playing field\", according to Swatantra Kumar Rustagi, president of the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (Anmi), who attended the meeting. The rising share of algorithmic orders poses \"systemic risks\", the Reserve Bank of India said last year.\n\nSebi didn't reply to emailed questions. An NSE spokesman didn't respond to an email seeking comment. The bourse will submit a detailed report to Sebi in the coming weeks to counter claims that high-frequency traders gained unfair access, people with knowledge of the matter said this week.\n\nThe report by the Sebi's advisory panel, which hasn't been released, said that between 2012 and 2014, NSE handled orders to trade on a first-come, first-served basis a design that made it prone to abuse.\n\nThe panel, whose work was prompted by claims from an unidentified whistle-blower, said it didn't have enough information to determine whether NSE officials colluded with traders to give them preferential access, and called for Sebi to investigate further.\n\nSebi joins its global peers, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in facing criticism for being slow to address alleged abuses by HFT firms.\n\n\"The situation here is no different from the one prevailing in the developed markets, where HFT has come in for similar criticism,\" said Deven Choksey, managing director at brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt, a member of the NSE and the Bombay Stock Exchange, India's second-largest exchange.\n\nSebi has taken some steps to govern computerised trading. The regulator has guidelines that stipulate that brokers offering algorithmic trading facilities must get their systems audited every six months. The watchdog also fixed steep penalties on trading firms that place a large number of orders that don't result into actual transactions.\n\nYet market participants say some aspects of HFT are still too lightly regulated. The regulator doesn't have rules on how lines should connect high-speed traders to their colocation facilities and exchanges or how to distribute and process orders sent to exchange servers, critics say.\n\nAnmi and the Brokers Forum, two of the country's largest brokerage associations which together have 1,500 members, are calling for a formal investigation into the panel's findings. Sebi is planning to hire an external agency to advise it on ways to minimise risks in HFT, Mint newspaper reported on Thursday, citing two people it didn't identify.\n\n\"If unfair access has been granted to some brokers then clearly that is very concerning,\" said Derek McCole, head of dealing for Asia Pacific at Aberdeen Asset Management plc, which oversees about US$428 billion. \"We can live with HFT as long as there is a level playing field and no preferential treatment for faster data.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a20347c6352991d2db8fb271ae17db965b2cb5ba839f2a8cf577272dee80dac1?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "CALL FOR ACTION: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has been asked to take action after claims that there may have been collusion between the country's biggest bourse and a high-frequency trading company."}]}

Most of the new stores will be in the Cotai Strip, where Sands China Ltd will open its Parisian resort this year and Wynn Macau Ltd will debut the Wynn Palace.\n\n\"This year we're still going ahead with our major expansion plan,\" explained Mr Choi. \"That plan is in Macau.\"\n\nThe peninsula, home to the world's biggest gambling centre, is trying to diversify its image by welcoming luxury-brand shoppers. That effort is helping siphon big spenders from Hong Kong, where the number of visitors from China dropped for nine straight months and retail sales in February plunged the most in 17 years.\n\nThe outlook isn't any better for next week's Labor Day holiday, with the Hong Kong Travel Industry Council estimating the number of package-tour travellers will drop by 50 per cent.\n\nThe tour-group visitor count, which mostly consists of Chinese tourists from the mainland, plunged 60 per cent in the first quarter from a year before.\n\n\"We don't see any recovery signs in the upcoming Labor Day holiday,\" said Joseph Tung, the council's executive director.\n\nThe gloom engulfed even Apple Inc, with sales for Greater China plunging 26 per cent in the quarter ending March 30.\n\n\"The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong,\" chief executive officer Tim Cook said during an April 26 call with analysts. One reason he cited is the local currency's peg to the stronger US dollar. \"That has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago,\" Mr Cook added.\n\nLuxury handbag and fashion retailers also are taking hits in the city. Burberry Group plc sales in Hong Kong fell more than 20 per cent for a third straight quarter, and the company is seeking to reduce its local rent payments.\n\nPrada SpA, which held Hong Kong's biggest initial public offering in 2011, reported sales in Asia fell 16 per cent last year.\n\n\"The near-term outlook for retail sales will still be constrained by the weak inbound tourism performance and uncertain economic prospects,\" the Hong Kong government said after retail statistics were released in late March.\n\nMr Choi's father is billionaire Francis Choi, whose Early Light Industrial Co Ltd makes toys for more than 30 brands, including Mattel, Hasbro, Disney and Wow Wee.\n\nEarly Light also owns properties in Hong Kong and is moving into consumer electronics and medical products to help increase profit margins, the younger Choi, 30, said.\n\nHalewinner outlets sell watches from more than 40 brands, including a US$200,000 Jaeger-LeCoultre and a US$180,000 Blancpain. During an April 20 interview at a Halewinner outlet in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong's premier retail district, Mr Choi wore a steel Audemars Piguet Royal Oak timepiece priced at US$21,000.\n\nThe family acquired the watch retailer in 2010, when it had just seven stores. Now it has more than 30 outlets in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China. Sales at its Hong Kong stores dropped 30 per cent last year amid China's economic slowdown, a government anti-corruption campaign and protests by Hong Kong residents claiming the city caters to wealthy mainland visitors at their expense.\n\nSwiss watch exports to Hong Kong in March fell 38 per cent from a year ago, the most among major markets, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\n\nChow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd, the world's largest listed jewellery chain, and Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd reported slumping sales during the Chinese New Year holiday in February, when the number of mainland Chinese tourists to Hong Kong dropped by 26 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nChina's economic slowdown and anti-corruption efforts also affect Macau and its US$30 billion casino industry, yet there are signs the market has hit bottom. Visitor totals for the former Portuguese colony rose 4.2 per cent last month, and a flood of new projects like the Batman Ride targets tourists and families.\n\n\"Retailers are still willing to expand in Macau because Chinese visitors will continue to come and play in the gaming hub,\" said Michael Cheng, Asia Pacific & Hong Kong/China retail & consumer partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

This is in line with the S$4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme launched in this year's Budget to support enterprises and industries and help them create value, drive growth and integrate their efforts through innovation.\n\nThrough innovation, local companies can then produce new products that have more nutrition that are suited to the Asian consumer.\n\nSome of the ongoing research projects presented during the visit included how the consumption of gel oils, compared to liquid oils, could slow down changes in blood glucose levels. Another study presented was about developing ways to alter the tastes of nutritious foods, which may sometimes be avoided due to their taste, to suit the Asian palate.\n\nThis way, the methods of preparing foods could potentially be adopted by local companies to produce nutritious yet nice-tasting foods, which is important for healthcare promotion as well as creation of value in the food manufacturing industry, said Mr Heng.\n\nMr Heng concluded his visit by saying: \"Singapore has a reputation for food safety and food quality. So by adding this layer of nutrition and how nutrition affects human health, it will give our local food companies, especially our SMEs, an important competitive edge.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is also extending its embrace to small and medium enterprises.\n\nWhen it comes to \"partnership\" Mr Chan said the tripartite partners are working together upstream to create the jobs of tomorrow, develop the skills needed and make sure workers are fitted in the right jobs. Midstream, they are engaged in \"re-training, upskilling and second skilling\" - and placing displaced workers.\n\nDownstream, Mr Chan said the tripartite partners are pushing to extend the work life options of elderly workers.\n\nOn \"attitude\", the NTUC boss said Singapore has leaders who face reality. They don't believe in sugar coating of facts or unrealistic policies - and they never choose the easy way out.\n\n\"We have a leadership that care for, fair to and grow with workers,\" said Mr Chan. They have the right values - they put workers first and don't take privileges as entitlements. And they are good stewards of resources.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its portfolio comprises a total of 4,909 rooms.\n\nFor the quarter under review, gross revenue edged up 5.8 per cent to S$44.66 million while net property income (NPI) slid to S$33.71 million, down 2.3 per cent.\n\nContributions from its Singapore hotels and Maldives resorts fell due to the operating environment, while its Australian hotels saw lower rent contribution due to the stronger Singapore dollar and a smaller variable income for FY15.\n\nThe fall in NPI was offset by inorganic contribution from Hilton Cambridge City Centre and higher rent contribution from its hotel in New Zealand as it recognised a full-year variable income of S$0.5 million for the first time, on the back of a strong performance in FY15.\n\n\"The weak global economy has given rise to a challenging operating environment. Although there has been some improvement in visitor arrivals, corporate expenditure remains constrained which has affected our core Singapore portfolio performance,\" said Vincent Yeo, chief executive of CDLHT's managers.\n\nTotal income available for distribution (after deducting income retained for working capital) was S$21.94 million, down 8.5 per cent from a year ago. This excludes contribution from its Japan hotels, which is only available for distribution in the second quarter.\n\nMr Yeo added: \"The performance has also been affected by our ongoing asset enhancement initiatives at Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel and M Hotel which are slated for completion in 2016.\"\n\nHe went on to add that the asset enhancements would improve their competitiveness and allow them to capitalise on the positive mid-to-long term outlook for the local tourism sector.\n\nFor its Singapore hotels, revenue per available room dropped nearly 7 per cent to S$161 on the back of new rooms being added to the market and an uncertain global economy. Average occupancy rate slid 3.8 percentage points to 83.9 per cent while the average daily rate was 3 per cent lower at S$191.\n\nThe counter closed at S$1.395 on Friday, down six cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the 12 months through March the core PCE rose 1.6 per cent after advancing 1.7 per cent in February.\n\nThe core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below the central bank's 2 per cent target. The Fed said on Wednesday that its policy-setting committee was continuing to \"closely\" monitor inflation.\n\nIt left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further. It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nFed officials earlier this year forecast two more rate hikes for 2016. But market-based measures of Fed policy expectations are mostly leaning toward one rate increase this year.\n\nInflation is being restrained by a strong US dollar and cheaper energy. A tightening labour market also has failed to generate strong wage gains, contributing to moderate consumption growth.\n\nIn March, consumer spending ticked up 0.1 per cent after an upwardly revised 0.2 per cent gain in February. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, was previously reported to have risen 0.1 per cent in February.\n\nWhen adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged after increasing 0.3 per cent in February. The consumer spending figures were included in the first-quarter GDP report published on Thursday.\n\nThe economy grew at a 0.5 per cent annual rate in the January-March period, a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter's 1.4 per cent pace.\n\nConsumer spending is expected to regain momentum as wages steadily rise. Personal income rose 0.4 per cent in March after nudging up 0.1 per cent in February. Savings jumped to US$735.5 billion last month, the highest level since December 2012, from US$696.4 billion in February.

That's his personal choice. But work experience, or the lack of it, is a relevant fact when we consider the credentials of a candidate.\"\n\nShe was one of five speakers at the two-hour rally, including Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob, two Bukit Batok residents and Mr Murali himself.\n\nThe minister also suggested that voters seek references from people who have worked closely with the two candidates, such as their colleagues and supervisors.\n\n\"It will be very interesting to see if there will be a referral letter (for Dr Chee) from Mr Chiam (See Tong) and what he would write about him,\" said Ms Fu, noting that it was Mr Chiam who recruited Dr Chee into the SDP back in 1992.\n\nMr Chiam, the SDP's founder, resigned as secretary-general following a dispute with Dr Chee over the latter's hunger strike after his sacking from NUS. Mr Chiam subsequently resigned and was later replaced by Dr Chee.\n\nMs Fu praised Mr Murali's commitment in serving Bukit Batok for the last 16 years, and described him as a sincere, humble and committed man who was spoken highly of by many people.\n\nShe said Bukit Batok should be proud to have him, a person \"of a minority race who made good in life because of hard work\".\n\nShe urged caution against those who choose to play the race card, such as by asking Chinese residents to vote for a Chinese candidate, and called on the SDP to clarify its position on this issue \"loud and clear\".\n\n\"From the track record of the two candidates, we have to ask ourselves if they have the interests of Bukit Batok residents at heart, or are they vying for the position (of MP) to meet their personal political objectives?\" she said.\n\nMr Murali, meanwhile, stressed that he did not regard politics as a career, but rather as a \"cause and a sacred duty\".\n\nThe 48-year-old lawyer promised to bring to Bukit Batok a lifetime of experience and lessons, and pledged to work with all his heart, and to put the residents' needs and concerns before his own.\n\n\"I want to make a positive difference for you. The day I stop doing that, I will leave. When I leave, I leave with the shirt on my back and nothing else, except memories of my service with you,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Friday though, selling of the banks saw turnover increase from Thursday's S$1.06 billion to one billion units worth S$1.2 billion. Excluding warrants, there were 170 rises against 225 falls.\n\nAmong blue chips, banks were the prime plays as UOB and OCBC reported their first quarter figures on Thursday and Friday respectively - the former registering a 4.4 per cent drop in net profit to S$766 million for the three months ended March 31, and the latter a 14 per cent fall to S$856 million. All three banks ended weaker on Friday.\n\nRHB in a Friday report said it expects UOB's topline growth to be muted due to modest loan growth, a flattish net interest margin (NIM) and lower non-interest income. \"2016F P/BV (price/book value) of 0.9x is below -1SD (standard deviation), the historical mean but broadening weakness in the domestic economy would continue to weigh on investor sentiment,\" it said. RHB is \"neutral\" on the stock and has a S$19.10 target price.\n\nKGI, meanwhile, maintained its \"hold\" on UOB with an unchanged target of S$17.37 as it is cautious about the bank's longer-term performance.\n\n\"While UOB remains a defensive play among its local peers with its lower exposure to both China and the commodities sector (as of last year), we believe potential upside may be limited due to the weaker loan growth and expected flattish NIMs in 2016,\" said the broker.\n\nElsewhere, shares of rail operator SMRT on Friday rose S$0.05 to S$1.53 on volume of 3.9 million after the company reported a 27.6 per cent rise in fourth quarter net profit to S$26.6 million, which helped lift full-year profit for the year ended March 31 to S$109.3 million.\n\nSMRT's operating profit for the full year included a net property tax refund of S$17.1 million relating to over-assessment in prior years. Without this refund, rail operations would have suffered a S$9.6 million operating loss.\n\nOn the latest US GDP data, ABN Amro noted that the US economy has a recent history of weak first quarter data, but weather/other special factors were less important this year.\n\n\"The components of US GDP on the surface look just as bad as the headline. Some of the most cyclical parts of expenditure are contracting,\" said the bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/play-central", "site_title": "Play central", "publish_date": null, "content": "Play central\n\nThe June holidays might be a month away, but it's never too early to start planning for fun activities that kids love, with plenty of lessons embedded within.\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 29, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nNO parent likes spending the weekend trying to stream Beyonce's Lemonade \"visual album\" on their smartphone in the corridor of a dour mall while waiting for junior to finish a two hour-long enrichment class. Worse yet, try asking any child if he enjoys Saturday morning classes and you'd be met with a look sadder than Queen Bey's rant about infidelity.\n\nThe good news is, the deities of kiasu parenting have finally answered the prayers of Singaporean folks, presenting a host of educational venues that encourages learning through play. Feel guilty about going to Universal Studios instead of helping your tween discover her true profession through cram classes? Then check out KidZania, a theme park where children can role-play occupations such as being a pilot, doctor or even candy chef.\n\n\"KidZania appeals to families who are seeking a different theme park experience, veering away from traditional rides and towards an experience that balances the importance of learning with having fun,\" says Leong Yue Weng, general manager of KidZania Singapore.\n\n\"In KidZania, kids are empowered to take charge and make their own decisions, through role-play.\"\n\nThe brainchild of Mexican entrepreneur Xavier Lopez Ancona, who founded KidZania in 1999, the indoor edutainment centre on Sentosa allows children to experience the world of adults in a replica of a real city. Children aged four and above are empowered to live out their aspirations through activities, such as setting up a bank account and receiving a bank card at a Maybank-fronted outlet, to earning cash through various job experiences to help children build up their confidence, develop life skills as well as social skills, and also gain greater awareness about social values.\n\nThis writer was even approached by an earnest young gentleman trying to recommend an insurance policy. And no, mummy and daddy are not allowed to help the kids stand in line or carry out their tasks, but simply offer some support as the children independently try out a range of professions.\n\nAs for those exasperated because kiddo hates spending hours on a still life sketch of a bowl of fruit, try introducing the budding Georgette Chen to art through The Keppel Centre for Art Education at the National Gallery and Playeum, Children's Centre for Creativity at Gillman Barracks. The latter is Singapore's first children's centre for creativity. The non-profit organisation opened its first permanent space at Gillman Barracks in September last year and revolves around open-ended, exploratory learning and play.\n\nIn a study involving 300 children in Singapore conducted by Playeum eight years ago, it was revealed that local kids played for an average of nine hours a week less than their parents did when they were children. But rather than simply encouraging more hours on computer games or dressing up Sofia the First dolls, the centre works with artists on developing environments and activities to ignite the ideas and learning of children.\n\n\"The concept came about as the founders of Playeum, who are themselves parents, realised how children are often instructed and told what to do, even in a creative context,\" explains Anna Salaman, executive director of Playeum.\n\n\"And so they were driven to create initiatives whereby children's creative competencies were allowed to be revealed, and were heartened when they saw children responding very well to open-ended activities through their residency at the National Museum and also multiple exercises in the heartlands and in libraries around the country.\"\n\nIts current exhibition, titled Hideaways - Creating with Nature, is an immersive environment spearheaded by artist and creative director Jeremy Chu. The Singaporean-born artist, who has worked a lot with communities such as an art collaboration with Indonesian villages, started the process by working with Playeum's education researchers on a series of consultation sessions with children to discover what kids would love to explore. After which, a brief was sent out to artists who would then submit their proposals for works and activities.\n\n\"We try to inspire artists to work with children and view this work as a highly valuable process,\" explains Ms Salaman.\n\n\"Artists are always amazed as they realise that children have an incredibly divergent way of thinking, and are able to see their ideas expanded in such creative ways that they would never have imagined on their own.\"\n\nIndeed, the idea of art appreciation as a high-brow activity best left to learned grown-ups is fast disintegrating as artists and institutions alike turn to the backpack-carrying set as a key audience.\n\nMuseums around the world have been tailoring their exhibitions and programmes to be more inclusive of little tykes, and the National Gallery has even launched The Keppel Centre for Art Education, the first learning facility of its kind in the region that offers exciting and accessible art-related programmes for children, youth and families. Comprising four interactive activity zones - Art Corridor, Art Playscape, Project Gallery and the Children's Museum - these spaces are designed to stimulate the imagination of younger audiences and make the learning of art more inspiring and accessible, based on the belief that every person is born creative.\n\n\"The creative potential of learning through purposeful play is a powerful one,\" says Suenne Megan Tan, director of education and programmes at the National Gallery.\n\n\"Playing is an important form of putting what we learn into practice. While play is crucial for a child's development, it is also beneficial for people of all ages.\"\n\nRecognising that children respond to a multi-sensorial art experience, the Centre will feature specially commissioned artworks designed to engage younger audiences, children-centred spaces, studio workshops, as well as learning spaces for youth and young adults. And the interesting thing about these art-based spaces is that youngsters not only learn more about being creative, they are able to discover other subjects through art.\n\nPlayeum's current exhibition is inspired by the natural surroundings at its Gillman Barracks venue, and the installations encourage children to explore the outdoors and appreciate plants, animals and insects. Exhibits such as a station where children could magnify insect and plant specimens, and then create a drawing from what they see, are imbued with lessons on art as well as biology.\n\n\"In the past, the challenge has always been for parents to see the value and importance in art education,\" adds Ms Tan. \"There had traditionally also been little emphasis to leverage on the creative potential of art as a core foundation for child development.\"\n\nInstead of providing parents and children with a fixed set of instructions on how to carry out tasks and achieve learning milestones, Playeum encourages families to explore various themes and use the centre as a starting point for initiating more conversations about creativity and learning. \"Initially parents have to go on a bit of a journey because there isn't anything like Playeum in Singapore, and we had to sometimes explain why kids can't just be dropped off at the centre on their own,\" says Ms Salaman.\n\n\"But there are huge benefits from play that can be applied to formal education, such as developing a certain maturity when they discover that failure is part of a learning process and not an end.\"\n\nFor those after some downtime following months of gruelling homework and tuition classes, try the Robot Kitty theme park event next month. Although the popular Sanrio character Hello Kitty is perhaps better associated with its kawaii (cute) quotient then education, fans of the mouthless cat can take some comfort if they decide to take their kids to the upcoming event, held from June 11 to 21 at Suntec City Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\n\"The main aim of Hello Kitty events is and always has been to bring fun, play and enjoyment to the whole family,\" says Jacky Teo, chief executive officer and founder of Mighty-Eight, the company behind the themed event.\n\n\"That said, our events also have educational elements for children as Mighty-Eight enjoys helping children learn through play. At Robot Kitty Singapore 2016, children and their families will get to hone their cognitive and psychomotor skills at the five gaming stations.\"\n\nFollowing runs in the region, the event will see Hello Kitty take on a robot persona. Participants will then have to combine their cognitive logic and psychomotor skills to successfully complete games at various stations, set up to resemble a manufacturing production line. Its organisers predict 40 per cent of attendees will be children and youth.\n\nUltimately, any experience could be an opportunity for learning and fun, when children are provided with the proper guidance. So before being tempted to sign up for yet another class or tuition session, consider some quality bonding time instead for a real lesson to remember.\n\n\"Adults play a critical role in facilitating their child's learning journey when in KidZania Singapore, choosing to participate in selected role-play activities, such as a tourist on the tour bus to enhance the realistic experience and foster confidence for participating children,\" says Mr Leong.\n\n\"They are also able to observe, actively discuss, and follow up with their child as they make decisions in the city - from which activities to prioritise to tips on financial planning. Depending on the choices that each child makes, the takeaways are always different.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

No investigators from any regulators will be present, the company said in a statement.\n\nDaimler said last week it's cooperating fully with authorities following the request from the Justice Department for an internal investigation. The request follows a US class-action lawsuit alleging some of its cars violated emissions standards, which the company has said is \"baseless\".\n\nDaimler's diesel emissions have been in the spotlight since a Mercedes owner in Illinois filed suit two months ago. The suit, followed by similar ones, alleges Mercedes-Benz clean-diesel models contain a device that causes the vehicles to violate US emissions standards when run at cooler temperatures, making them less environmentally friendly than advertised.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The disposal will bring the total of its divestments to 4.2 billion euros, it added.\n\nThe shares rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early Paris trading.\n\nThe deal follows Casino's agreement earlier this year to sell control of Thai supermarket chain Big C Supercenter pcl to billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's TCC Holding Co for 3.1 billion euros. Casino is selling assets to cut borrowings amid an attack from short-seller Carson Block, who has said the retailer has a \"dangerously\" high debt burden - an assertion the company denies. Standard and Poor's cut Casino's credit rating to junk in March.\n\n\"This is another piece of good news for Casino,\" said Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. \"We expect the high valuation to act as a catalyst for the stock. This comes as welcome news after some were suggesting the sale wouldn't go through after Lotte had pulled out.\" South Korea's Lotte Group said on April 22 that it wouldn't pursue the asset, without giving a reason.\n\nCasino is selling assets in Asia and Latin America to cut debt, while focusing on price and convenience in its largest market, France, as it competes for growth amid weak consumer spending.\n\nRising retail sales and booming foreign investment are helping the Vietnamese economy expand. Achieving the government's growth forecast of about 6.7 per cent this year would make the South-east Asian nation one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.\n\nConsumer-product companies including Dutch brewer Heineken NV and Dove soap maker Unilever have experienced strong growth in the country over the past year.\n\n\"The retail market is booming here,\" said Ralf Matthaes, managing director of consultancy Infocus Mekong Research in Ho Chi Minh City. \"The bottom line is every Tom, Dick and Harry is trying to come in here.

A gauge of the dollar's strength extended its 1 per cent slide on Thursday, when the Bank of Japan's decision to unexpectedly keep monetary policy unchanged sent the yen surging.\n\nThe offshore yuan weakened 0.12 per cent to 6.4914 as of 5:35 pm in Hong Kong after gaining 0.3 per cent in the last session.\n\nWhile the change in the fixing is extreme relative to the small moves of recent years, analysts said it reflects increased volatility in the dollar against other major exchange rates rather than a policy shift by the People's Bank of China. The yuan weakened against a basket of peers on Friday.\n\n\"The offshore yuan's reaction is muted, so it seems the market was already expecting a much stronger fixing,\" said Ken Cheung, a currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd in Hong Kong.\n\n\"This is a reaction to the dollar weakness overnight, and there's not much in the way of policy intention to read into.\" The dollar headed for its the lowest close in almost a year on Friday as signs of slowing growth in the US dimmed prospects for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase.\n\nA Bloomberg replica of the CFETS RMB Index, which measures the yuan against 13 exchange rates, fell 0.2 per cent to a 17-month low. The onshore yuan weakened 0.2 per cent.\n\n\"The fixing is no surprise, the expectation for a stronger yuan fix was laid by the gains for the yen after the Bank of Japan announcement yesterday,\" said Patrick Bennett, a strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The trade-weighted basket continues to depreciate, albeit at a modest pace.

Yields should be higher than 2.10 per cent, based on the models the firm uses to analyze bonds, versus 1.84 per cent Friday.\n\nMorgan Stanley says US government securities are poised to gain and the odds of a rate increase in June are declining. Ten-year yields will drop to 1.45 per cent by Sept 30, based on the firm's \"base case\" forecast, according to a report Thursday by analysts including Matthew Hornbach, the head of global interest-rate strategy in New York.\n\nThe firms, which are among the 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed, are at odds as investors decipher the central bank's views on the economy in its statement this week. Morgan Stanley called the comment \"slightly dovish.\"\n\nGoldman forecasts rate increases in June, September and December. The US plans to report on consumer spending Friday, after data Thursday showed the economy growing at its slowest pace in two years.\n\nCentral bankers used their statement to indicate growing confidence in the world economy while suggestingthey're still looking for the signs of growth, inflation and global stability to justify a move.\n\nTreasuries were little changed Friday as of 10:42 am in London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.625 per cent security due in February 2026 was 98 1/8.\n\nThe Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index has fallen 0.3 per cent in April, heading for its first monthly decline this year. It has returned 2.9 per cent in 2016, with the 10-year yield falling from 2.27 per cent at the close of 2015.\n\nTreasuries were closed in Japan Friday for a holiday. They're scheduled to trade as usual in the UK and the US, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. US government securities trading will be shut in the UK May 2 and in Japan for three days starting May 3, based on the association's website.\n\nGoldman Sachs has been calling for yields to rise, though it reduced its year-end forecast in February to 2.75 per cent from 3 per cent.\n\nMorgan Stanley cut its own outlook in March and said 2016 may be known as the \"Year of the Bull\" for bonds. The firm's March report also included the 1.45 per cent prediction for the end of September.\n\nEarly in 2015, with the 10-year benchmark at about 1.9 per cent, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both predicted it would jump to 2.85 per cent by the close of the year - more than half a per centage point higher than the final level.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

With this renewed volatility, a focus on risk in investing and a desire for safety has naturally come. But what is volatility? What drives it? Why does it come in cycles? Where are we now? And is it the same thing as risk?\n\nVolatility in investing refers to the degree to which an asset's value fluctuates. The most common way to measure it is with a statistical concept called standard deviation which shows how tightly clustered past changes in the value of an asset or returns have been around their average in a certain period.\n\nThe higher the standard deviation the greater the volatility. The standard deviation of monthly returns based on very long-term data for major asset classes is around 0.5 per cent for Australian cash, 3.5 per cent for Australian government bonds, 12 per cent for Australian real estate investment trusts, 16.5 per cent for Australian shares and 15.5 per cent for global shares.

My priority is to make sure the estate is taken care of with maximum efficiency and minimum wastage,\" he said, speaking at the rally which took place at a field along Bukit Batok Industrial Park A.\n\nRunning the town council would allow the SDP to demonstrate its competence, Dr Chee added.\n\nDr Chee revealed that the SDP has already formed a transition team for the smooth handover of duties from the People's Action Party (PAP) if the SDP wins so that the town council works seamlessly from the very onset. The team comprises four accountants, three estate managers and six lawyers.\n\nThe secretary-general of the SDP also highlighted that no managing agent would be hired, as this would add to expenses.\n\nBy dedicating himself to the proper management of town-council operations, conservancy charges would be kept to a minimum, he asserted.\n\nIn addition, Dr Chee also highlighted that PAP candidate Murali Pillai had described his plans for a S$1.9 million Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) for 10 blocks of flats as \"a funding-neutral project\" which means it was not dependent on whether the PAP wins or loses.\n\nOther speakers at the rally from the SDP included Paul Tambyah, Wong Souk Yee and Sadasivan Veriyah.\n\nIn his speech, Dr Tambyah sought to assure Bukit Batok residents that both the HDB and NRP programmes will continue, regardless of who is voted in on May 7.\n\nAhead of last year's general election, Bukit Batok's former MP David Ong had proposed S$24 million in upgrading works and new facilities such as eldercare centres.\n\n\"This constituency will not be left behind,\" said Dr Tambyah, adding that while the PAP has put forward these proposals, the SDP will implement them if that's what the people want.\n\nMeanwhile, in her speech, Ms Wong stressed that more opposition voices are needed to avoid a \"lop-sided\" Parliament where laws are passed without meaningful debate.\n\nThere will be no rallies on Saturday as neither the PAP nor SDP applied for one.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Similar electricity problems had already taken place during diving competitions in February.\n\nAn overheated generator was blamed.\n\n\"The risk of this happening again during the Games is zero, because we will have a dual power feed system, Mr Garcia said, adding that there has only been one generator so far to reduce costs.\n\nWith Brazil in the grips of a deep economic recession, about 20 per cent of Rio 2016's operational budget was cut.\n\nIt was also very hot on the lower levels of the aquatics stadium, which became a sauna of sorts.\n\n\"Temperatures during the Games will be completely different, since it will be (the Southern Hemisphere's) winter.\"\n\nTemperatures average 25 degrees Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) in August in Rio, down from 30 in this unusually warm month of April.\n\n\"The stadium is completely covered, and it's important to have artificial ventilation on the lower levels,\" FINA swimming federation executive Cornel Marculescu told AFP.\n\n\"We spoke with Rio's Mayor Eduardo Paes, who told us he would work on it.

It left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further.\n\nThe central bank hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade and Fed policymakers earlier this year forecast two more rate hikes for 2016. But market-based measures of Fed policy expectations mostly lean to one hike this year.\n\nThe US dollar fell to an eight-month low against a basket of currencies on the data. US stocks tumbled and prices for US government bonds weakened marginally.\n\nMODEST WAGE INFLATION\n\nIn a separate report, the Labor Department said its employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 per cent in the first quarter after gaining 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nLabor costs rose 1.9 per cent in the 12 months through March, well below the 3 per cent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's inflation target. The ECI increased 2 per cent in the year to December.\n\nThe ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.\n\nA strong US dollar and lower energy prices are constraining inflation. Wage growth has been frustratingly slow and could remain moderate as the fairly robust labor market attracts people who had given up looking for work.\n\nThough employment gains have been broad, they have tended to be concentrated in the services industries, especially restaurants and the retail sector, which typically pay less compared to manufacturing and construction jobs.\n\nLack of strong wage growth has contributed to moderate consumption growth.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, ticked up 0.1 per cent in March after a 0.2 per cent gain in February.\n\nThe consumer spending figures were included in Thursday's gross domestic product report, which showed the economy growing at a 0.5 per cent annual rate in the first quarter, a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter's 1.4 per cent pace.\n\nWith income rising 0.4 per cent in March and savings jumping to a more than three-year high last month, consumer spending is expected to regain momentum.\n\nBut households are likely to remain hesitant to loosen their purse strings in the near term, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dipped to 89.0 in April from a reading of 91.0 in March.\n\n\"There is scope for households to draw down their savings in the second quarter,\" said Steve Murphy, a US economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.\n\n\"When combined with healthy employment gains, healthy balance sheets, we think the conditions are ripe for a rebound in consumption growth in the second quarter.\"\n\nIn a fourth report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its Chicago business barometer declined 3.2 points to a reading of 50.4 in April as new orders fell and factory employment contracted. The report pointed to further downside risks to the troubled manufacturing sector.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/smart-invisible-kitchen", "site_title": "From smart to the invisible kitchen", "publish_date": null, "content": "From smart to the invisible kitchen\n\nThe recent Eurocucina 2016 provided a peek into what the future of cooking will look like.\n\nJaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 29, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nCHEFS, beware. Going by what was on show at last week's Eurocucina 2016, people will be eating what their kitchens cook for them.\n\nCrammed into two pavilions as part of the mammoth Salon del Mobile Milano - the annual furniture fair which makes our Food&Hotel Asia look like a pop-up flea market - kitchen brands big, small and super-exclusive were on hand to extol the virtues of the latest cooking range, dishwasher, coffee machine and ovens with near artificial intelligence.\n\nThere were cooker hoods that you could use to suck cooking fumes out of your stir-fry, but shaped like cool lamps that you can also use to light up your living room. There's even a thoughtful slot for you to stick your cellphone in. There were cooking stoves that come with recipes you can download into an iPad. Take a photo of any ingredient you want to cook and the iPad automatically comes up with recipes you can choose.\n\nThere are stove tops that can sense how big your pot is and calculate the time needed for simmering your stew. And those that control the temperature too - so if the doorbell rings while you're frying eggs or pancakes, you can just leave them there without worrying about burning your breakfast.\n\nHow does one bring together the mind-boggling variety of existing and future technology, distil it and make it useful and accessible to both IT-savvy millennials and their less adventurous parents?\n\nIf you can do all that, you will have the kitchen of the future, says Andreas Enslin, head of design at German appliance maker Miele, at the brand's mega-booth at Eurocucina in Milan earlier this month. Together with its range of new and upgraded appliances, Miele also hosted a secondary event at Zona Tortona to showcase its futuristic concept, The Invisible Kitchen. There, a cooking demonstration took place in a futuristic setting that was equal parts \"Beam me up Scotty\" Star Trek and Tom Cruise cooking a three-course meal in The Minority Report.\n\nIt wasn't so much about showcasing groundbreaking new products but about Miele's vision of what a kitchen in the future would look like. Literally a virtual assistant, The Invisible Kitchen suggests recipes, tells you how to make use of leftovers and if you're bad at measuring ingredients and tend to leave pots boiling over, the software swoops in to correct the situation. And instead of having to go through repetitive instructions such as the phone messaging service of banks and government offices, the system will remember what you know and adapt to your level of experience. \"It's not so much about new technology or products, they are already here,\" says Mr Enslin. \"It's about how you interact with them. We have the products now with all the automatic programmes but it's the missing links in between which we don't have.\n\n\"In the future, we will have an assistance system that will guide you - on different levels - through the cooking cycle. If you're a newbie who has only ordered pizza before, the system will make recommendations, help you to buy the ingredients and guide you through the cooking process. It will even know your health status, your allergies and who is dining with you, whether family or friends.\"\n\nWhile much of The Invisible Kitchen is about appealing to the younger customer demographic who fancy the idea of cooking via Bluetooth, it's also about cooking as a life process, adapting as the user ages.\n\n\"We are all getting older, and an ageing society means people will need help to stay independent for as long as they can. It's not about dementia, it's about being able to cook for yourself and not having your children worry about whether you're eating properly,\" says Mr Enslin. \"One of the advantages of the smart home is that we can take everything - cameras, recognition software, etc - and connect it to the kitchen so that, say, if grandma forgets to turn off the milk she's heating, the stove automatically cuts off and it can alert you to the situation.\"\n\nThe physical form of The Invisible Kitchen has yet to emerge, and having been in gestation for some eight years, it's been one of the longest ongoing development projects that Mr Enslin has taken on in the 10 years he has worked at Miele.\n\nIt helps that Miele isn't a listed company but independently owned by the families of its founding partners Carl Miele and Reinhard Zinkann, whose philosophy of Immer Besser (Forever Better) began in 1899 when they invented butter churning machines.\n\n\"My great-grandfather was living on a farm and saw how difficult it was to churn butter,\" explains great-grandson Marcus Miele, who now runs the company with co-proprietor Reinhard Zinkann Jr. \"He said: 'If you have better quality, it makes life better for the farmers, and that's what we strive for. Technology has to be there because you have to create the possibilities, but that's just one part. The other is, do you really like to use it, and is it beneficial?\"\n\nGiven its premium status and cool gadgets, and its reputed 20-year life span of the products it creates, obviously many people agree and have contributed to the company's healthy bottomline. At Eurocucina, there was plenty to drool over, be it its expanded range of steam-cum-microwave ovens, handle-less appliances, temperature controlled induction cookers or ultra-large free standing cooking ranges.\n\nIf you're thinking of redoing or just adding on to your kitchen, check out the ArtLine series of appliances that won't spoil the uninterrupted smooth flow of your handle-less cabinets. Ovens, combination steam-microwave ovens, warming drawers and vacuum sealers all come with flush, protrusion-free surfaces, opened by a simple touch.\n\nThe vacuum sealer is a level above your home version which can even seal meats in liquid, thanks to its vacuum chamber. Pop the packages into the steam oven and you're ready to cook sous vide.\n\nSeven years in the making, the XXL range cooker is a giant, free-standing appliance that's up to 48 inches wide with an oven big enough to cook two turkeys at a time or even a small pig, topped with heavy duty gas burners that could well provide all the wok hei you need.\n\nThere's also the aforementioned temperature-controlled induction stove where you can leave your egg frying as you answer the phone or deal with the delivery man without coming back to a charred mess. And try to resist the blackboard covered fridge - a whimsical nod to school and fridge magnets. The entire front of the fridge is covered in blackboard material complete with a white 'chalk' pen that you can use to write reminders or shopping lists then and there.\n\n\"In spite of all the smart home innovations, we still have a lot of analogue innovations,\" says Dr Miele. A lot of emphasis goes into studying how people use their appliances and how they tweak the technology to make life easier and more fun. \"It's not a huge investment but it's of great benefit to the user.\"\n\nSo forget about technology taking over our lives, at least where Miele is concerned. As chief designer Mr Enslin puts it, it's about \"taking technology and making it work for humans.\"\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Navy is scrapping the ban - and going further still - to adopt the most lenient rules on body art of any US military service.\n\nFrom next month, sailors will also be allowed a tattoo on their neck - up to one-inch across - and restrictions will be lifted on ink below the knee or elbow, including on the hands.\n\nAdditionally, sailors with visible tattoos will be allowed to work as Navy recruiters, a gig that was off-limits to them before.\n\n\"Everyone's really thrilled,\" said Navy Corpsman Everette Abney, 28, as he perused tattoo designs to add to the colorful selection already on his forearm.\n\nNews of the rule change was up on \"Facebook for maybe an hour, and it had been shared about 40,000 times,\" Mr Abney said.\n\nHis friend, Navy Corpsman Taylor Hoyte, 20, is getting a tattoo of a pair of interlocking hands as part of a design that will eventually be a sleeve.\n\n\"I want to keep going until I run out of room, from the neck down,\" she said.\n\nTattoos are a longstanding tradition among sailors the world over - think Popeye and his anchor - reaching back to the 18th century.\n\nBut in recent decades, as the military sought for troops to project a more uniform and professional image, even the Navy restricted what kind of tattoo sailors can wear.\n\nWith the practice more popular than ever among millennials and hipsters, the Navy's latest easing of the policy is aimed at reaching a wider array of potential sailors. According to a Harris poll, nearly half (47 per cent) of Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s have at least one tattoo.\n\n\"This policy has increased the pool of candidates we recruit from. Will we get new recruits that wouldn't have previously applied to the Navy? I think absolutely, yes,\" Navy spokesman Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen said in a phone interview.\n\n\"The Navy strives to reflect the nation we serve, to attract, recruit and retain the nation's best talent,\" he added.\n\nOffensive, overly vulgar or racist tattoos remain off-limits.\n\nMilitary tattoo restrictions have long stoked ire among rank-and-file troops. Many grumble that if they can die for their country, they should be able to express themselves on their skin.\n\n\"Today's military needs to understand... that letting service members have tattoos with less restrictions adds to their own esprit de corps. It boosts morale. It allows them to tap into an ancient warrior spirit,\" said Butch Johnson, owner of the popular Washington tattoo parlor, which is located next to a hip eatery.\n\n\"It is the one personal item that can be taken into a battlefield and give a service member that extra edge, a feeling of power, a reminder of family, patriotism, pride - and a tattoo can't be taken away.\" Mr Johnson says Marine Corps restrictions on tattoo sleeves - when they were implemented locally in 2012 - had hurt his bottom line.\n\nThe bearded artist traced his buzzing tattoo gun over the skin of Tyler McManus, 24, a former Marine who says he wasn't allowed to re-enlist in part because of his extensive tattoos.\n\n\"A lot of people that had tattoos were 'volun-told' to get out,\" said Mr McManus, who is getting a huge Polynesian tribal design inked across his back.\n\nThe popular military phrase: \"Si vis pacem, para bellum\" - If you want peace, prepare for war - stretches across his chest.\n\nSince leaving the Marines in 2014, he has had a full sleeve depicting a carp and a dragon in Japanese style etched onto his left arm.\n\nNow he is considering enlisting with the Navy because of the service's new rules.\n\n\"With the lax tattoo policy and the way that I read it, I would be much more obliged to go back into the Navy to serve with them,\" Mr McManus said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

The entire terminal will have a total capacity of up to 65 million TEUs.\n\nThe terminal will be developed in four phases over a span of some 30 years, with the Phase 1 reclamation works scheduled to be completed by early 2020s.\n\nA major component of Singapore's Next Generation Port (NGP) vision, Tuas Terminal will incorporate new features such as optimising land use by utilising both above and underground spaces for complementary purposes such as storage facilities; enhancing the safety and security of the port waters via a next-generation traffic management system; and increasing productivity and reducing labour costs through the use of technology such as automated yard cranes and port equipment.\n\nCoordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan marked the initiation ceremony on Friday by launching the first caisson. In total, 222 such caissons will form the permanent wharf structure.\n\nWith each caisson 28 metres tall and equivalent to the height of a 10-storey HDB block, the caissons designed for Tuas Terminal Phase 1 are among the largest in the world.\n\n\"The Tuas Terminal is a centrepiece of Singapore's NGP vision and demonstrates our strong commitment to strengthening and sustaining our leadership position as a global hub port and International Maritime Centre. Additionally, we hope that complex projects of this scale can inspire the next generation of engineers to join the profession and help shape our future,\" said Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore's chief executive, Andrew Tan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Entrenching the UK in an island would be a big mistake.\"\n\nWith only weeks to go before the June 23 referendum, Britain's Conservative cabinet has split over whether Britain should stay in the EU and polls show swathes of the electorate remain undecided. Mr Cameron, who is campaigning to stay in, has staked his career on the vote and focused his arguments on the economic dangers posed by an exit.\n\nGroups campaigning for the UK to leave have accused the government of scaremongering, with a group of eight pro-brexit economists on Thursday attacking a Treasury analysis of the risks of exit published earlier this month as a \"misleading piece of propaganda.\"\n\nThe campaign to quit the bloc has been on the back foot in recent weeks, with US President Barack Obama joining in the chorus of warnings about the potential fallout from an exit.\n\n\"The alternative to being in the European Union is not being in the European Union, Mr Lawson said. \"It may surprise you that most of the rest of the world is not in the European Union. And most of the rest of the world is doing better than the European Union.\"\n\nThe Number Cruncher Politics Referendum Forecast, generated by political blogger Matt Singh, showed the probability of Britain voting to leave the EU up 1 percentage point Thursday at 21 per cent.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Unlike other such morgues-in-disguise, which try to blend in by looking like hotels, Sousou doesn't refrigerate corpses, relying on air-conditioned rooms instead.\n\nAs Japan ages its people are dying off at a faster pace. About 20,000 more people per year are expiring with the death rate expected to peak at about 1.7 million a year by around 2040, according government estimates.\n\nBy then, barring any major influx of immigrants, Japan will have 20 million fewer people.\n\nResidents of Kawasaki are unhappy about living next to Sousou's hidden corpse refugees, with placards and flags dotting the neighbourhood expressing outrage at the presence of the morgue.\n\nYoko Masuzawa, 50, who, lives behind Sousou, demanded it put air ventilation grills above ground level, a request that she says it ignored.\n\n\"It was built so close, less than a metre away in some places,\" she added.\n\nSousou's customers, however, are grateful for a place to keep their deceased relatives. \"I think it's great that families and acquaintances can come and visit before she heads off to the crematorium,\" said 69-year-old Hirokazu Hosaka, as his mother's body lay in a decorated coffin in Sousou.\n\nMr Takegishi, who used to help organise weddings, is looking to tap growing demand, with plans to bring corpse hotels to other cities.

Itau, which reports first-quarter results on Tuesday, tapped a guarantee fund in February after Sete Brasil was unable to pay back loans from the Sao Paulo-based bank.\n\nState-owned Banco do Brasil has 4 billion reais in exposure to Sete Brasil and hasn't yet booked all the related losses, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"Bradesco's provisions increase expectations about what may come from Itau next week,\" said Max Bohm, an analyst at Empiricus Independent Research in Sao Paulo. \"The higher provisions raise concern about what we might see in upcoming quarters, especially if you look at the rate of debt overdue for 60 days.\"\n\nLate payments in Brazil have been increasing as borrowers grapple with the nation's worst recession in a century. The country's delinquency rate for loans more than 90 days overdue held at a three-year high of 3.5 per cent in March, according to central bank data.\n\nBradesco's figure climbed to 4.2 per cent in the first quarter from 3.6 per cent a year earlier. The bank's 60-day rate rose 0.8 per centage point to 5.3 per cent.\n\nBrazilian corporations are struggling to pay back their loans as a two-year economic downturn, high interest rates, falling commodity prices and a weaker currency combine to savage profit and revenue.\n\nA worsening political crisis in which President Dilma Rousseff is fighting off an impeachment effort has paralyzed reforms intended to jump-start the economy.\n\nSete Brasil has 18 billion reais in total debt, mostly with local banks. Its finances were torpedoed when state-owned oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA slashed a lease order for rigs to 10 from an original 28 after oil prices collapsed and Petrobras became entangled in a nationwide corruption scandal. Sete Brasil shareholders decided on April 20 to seek bankruptcy protection, a company official said at the time, without giving details on creditors or the expected timing.\n\nCaixa Economica Federal, another government-owned bank, has a 1.7 billion reais exposure to Sete Brasil, and Bradesco's total is about US$450 million.\n\nRather than setting aside provisions, many Brazilian banks have been restructuring loans, which could mask rising asset risks, Moody's Investors Service said in an April 11 report. Such restructurings rose 37 per cent at the end of 2015 from a year earlier, which may be understating loan delinquencies and overstating reserve coverage, the rating company said.\n\nOfficials at Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Caixa and Itau declined to comment on Sete Brasil.\n\nBradesco shares fell 2.1 per cent at 5:14 pm Thursday in Sao Paulo, while Itau dropped 0.7 per cent and Banco do Brasil lost 2.5 per cent. The Ibovespa index of the most-traded stocks declined 0.3 per cent.\n\nOne of the nation's highest-level bankers called the corporate credit crisis the worst in the nation's history as bankruptcy filings almost doubled to a record this year. Companies seeking protection from their creditors surged to 155 in February after rising 55 per cent last year, according to data provider Serasa Experian.\n\nThe government-owned pension funds for workers at Petrobras, Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica own about 38 per cent of Sete Brasil, and their losses would depend on previous provisions, one of the people said. Banco Santander Brasil SA is also a shareholder.\n\nThe FGTS retirement fund invested 2.5 billion reais in Sete Brasil's debt and capital, guaranteed by Caixa Economica. If that doesn't get repaid, the government will have to inject funds into Caixa Economica to support the company, according to Mansueto Almeida, an economic consultant who specializes in public finance.\n\n\"If you take 100 market analysts, 99 are betting that a capital injection for Caixa Economica will be necessary,\" Mr Almeida said. \"The only one who isn't making that bet is on vacation.\"\n\nProvisions for souring loans at Bradesco surged to 5.44 billion reais from 3.58 billion reais a year earlier, the bank said in a statement Thursday, and more provisions may be needed, executive managing director Luiz Carlos Angelotti said on a conference call.\n\nBradesco's return on equity, a measure of profitability, dropped to 17.5 per cent in the first quarter from 20.6 per cent a year earlier.\n\nAdjusted net income, which excludes one-time items, declined to 4.11 billion reais from 4.27 billion reais. That compares with the 4.35 billion-real estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

In March, Crowdo launched debt crowdfunding in Indonesia, to a pipeline of over 10,000 loans.\n\nMr Shimada said: \"Singapore is our home market, where we focus on both debt and equity solutions. Malaysia is our showcase market for equity crowdfunding, where we are now applying for a debt crowdfunding licence. Indonesia is our growth engine, driven by our dynamic debt crowdfunding business.\"\n\nAsked if Crowdo will pursue equity crowdfunding in Indonesia, Mr Shimada would only say that the platform's CMS licence allows it to serve startups from \"anywhere in the world\". He added that Thailand, Hong Kong and the Philippines are markets that Crowdo is likely to enter next.\n\nMeanwhile, Crowdo's peers Capbridge and FundedHere have received fully operational licences to run debt and equity crowdfunding platforms in Singapore.\n\nCapbridge, set up by Clearbridge Accelerator and the Singapore Exchange, offers only equity crowdfunding for now. The deal size of each of its 50 companies in the pipeline is between S$15 million and S$50 million, said Capbridge chief Steven Fang.\n\nFundedHere, which recently bagged S$1.74 million in seed funding, offers debt and equity crowdfunding. Chief Michael Tee said that it has since April received over 200 funding applications - an even mix of debt and equity-based funding - and is exploring regional expansion.\n\nCrowdo expects to receive full licensing by mid-year, and is currently fundraising for growth capital.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Whether it can continue operating will have a bearing on parent Hotel Lotte Co Ltd's planned summer stock listing, analysts said.\n\nLast November, the government did not renew licences held by Lotte and SK Networks Co Ltd that expire in June and May respectively, instead giving them to relative newcomers Shinsegae Co Ltd and Doosan Co Ltd.\n\nThe decision to add four more will take the number of downtown Seoul duty free stores to 13 by the end of 2016 from six a year earlier.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

He's resigning from the board's integrity committee with immediate effect, the bank said.\n\nMr Thoma, a Shearman & Sterling LLP lawyer, was left isolated after pushing to investigate Chairman Paul Achleitner and mounting intensive inquiries into Deutsche Bank executives, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nFriction arose as Mr Thoma sought to examine potential links between individual board members and legal cases starting in 2014, one of the people said.\n\nThat conflict burst into the open this week when at least two board members spoke out against him in public.\n\nDeputy Chairman Alfred Herling criticized him for being \"overzealous\" and spending too much in probing potential wrongdoing.

The additional capacity has taxed the grid's ability to transmit the influx of clean power.\n\nSome of China's renewable plants are idle as operators are unable to sell their output. The idle rate was 15 per cent for wind turbines last year and about 31 per cent for photovoltaics in the northwestern province of Gansu, according to data from the National Energy Administration.\n\nState Grid Corp of China, which manages the electricity grid in the world's most populous nation, in March blamed a lack of planning for congestion in its network that forced authorities to limit the amount of power renewable energy generators can sell. Neither the technology the grid uses nor the availability of investment funds were problems, Chairman Liu Zhenya said.\n\nThe WRI concurs that technical hurdles aren't the main roadblock.\n\nDespite a renewable energy law that prohibits curtailment, fossil fuel power plants in practice \"have priority over renewables, leaving less room for solar and wind power in a country with a large overcapacity of coal-fired power,\" according to WRI.\n\n\"There is also a lack of clarity on how the renewable energy integration mandate should be enforced.\" Besides restrictions on new coal power plants, the nation is seeking to design more policies to utilize idle renewable capacity. In March, it issued management rules to set an annual minimum purchase guarantee for wind and utility-scale solar generation to ensure reasonable profit for those projects.\n\n\"For the first time, the management rules stipulate that renewable energy power plants be compensated by fossil fuel plants that squeeze out their share of guaranteed purchase, making it costly for fossil fuel plants to generate electricity that should have come from renewable sources,\" said WRI.\n\nThe NEA in March published guidelines calling for power producers to tap renewable sources for at least 9 per cent of their output by 2020. The guidelines, which break down targets for 31 regions, exclude hydroelectric power as a renewable source and don't cover power producers with a specific focus on non-fossil fuels.\n\nThese latest actions \"are a significant step to see that less renewable energy is wasted in China,\" said WRI. \"They also reflect the government's attempt to tap into the power of the market to address the challenge.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

So many people are shouting, cheering for me. I'm glad with the warm welcome in every rally. I really didn't expect that,\" Pacquiao told AFP on Thursday during a break from the festivities.\n\nWith constant speculation that another mega-bucks bout against American rival Floyd Mayweather might lure him out of retirement, Pacquiao insisted he was enjoying \"retired life\" and that he was not thinking about boxing at all.\n\n\"I'm now a full-time politician. I remember when I dedicated myself to be a boxer and become a champion. It's my feeling right now,\" he said.\n\nPacquiao, who has served two terms as a congressman, is running for a seat in the 24-member Senate as part of a long-term strategy to become president, a not unrealistic ambition given his wild popularity.\n\nPacquiao's international reputation took a huge hit in February when the devout evangelical Christian described homosexuals as \"worse than animals\".\n\nMajor sponsor Nike immediately cancelled its partnership with him and a host of US celebrities voiced outrage.\n\nBut the comments had far less impact in the Philippines, with surveys showing his popularity slumping only slightly afterwards then quickly recovering.\n\nBoosted by his success against Bradley this month, Pacquiao is now in third place in the Senate race and a near certainty to take one of the 12 seats available, according to the latest survey from a major pollster.\n\nCampaigning in the bustling city of San Pablo Thursday, there was no sign of rancour. Vendors and tricycle drivers mobbed Pacquiao as he got off a flatbed truck, eager to touch their hero and pose for selfies.\n\nA high school drop-out, Pacquiao entered boxing to feed his family, and he says his political ambitions are anchored in his desire to help the poor.\n\nHe is promising to increase the salaries of teachers, offer scholarships to poor students and give subsidies to farmers, selling himself as a beacon of hope for millions of poor who have not felt the benefits of stellar economic growth under President Benigno Aquino.\n\n\"I tell them not to be discouraged because our life was worse than theirs. We did not have our own house, our own land and sometimes even food,\" Pacquiao said.\n\n\"I experienced what it was like to sleep on the streets. I want to serve so they will be proud that Manny is for the poor.\" Many in San Pablo said they were drawn to Pacquiao's message, as they talked about their own hardships.\n\n\"I hope he gives projects for non-college graduates,\" said housewife Jessica Bautista, 29, who only finished grade school.\n\n\"I hope we get training because the government and companies only prioritise graduates but we have no diploma.\" Bautista's husband, Julius, a tricycle driver, said he also supported Pacquiao.\n\n\"He is already rich so he will not be corrupt. I hope he just gives his salary to the poor,\" he said.\n\nAnswering his critics, who say he is not fit to be a senator because he has little education or track record as an effective lawmaker, Pacquiao insisted his rags-to-riches story was enough to qualify him for the job.\n\n\"God raised me from nothing into something. I think I am the right person, the best person to answer the poor,\" he said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

It has touted its plans for moon exploration and in late 2013 completed the first lunar \"soft landing\" since 1976 with the Chang'e-3 craft and its Jade Rabbit rover.\n\nThe country also plans to land the first probe ever on the dark side of the moon in 2018, another milestone.\n\nChina must \"raise its abilities and use the next 15 to 20 years to realise manned lunar exploration goals, and take a firm step for the Chinese people in breaking ground in the utilization of space\", Lieutenant General Zhang Yulin, deputy commander of the China Manned Space Program, said.\n\nLt-Gen Zhang made the comments in statement posted to the programme's website on Thursday.\n\nThe official China Daily newspaper said the announcement marked \"the country's first confirmation of a manned lunar exploration programme\".\n\nThe paper cited experts saying China needed first to develop a powerful enough rocket to lift a payload of at least 100 metric tons into low Earth orbit. It also needs more advanced technology, including new space suits, for a lunar mission.\n\nAdvancing China's space programme is a priority for Beijing, with President Xi Jinping calling for the country to establish itself as a space power.\n\nChina insists its programme is for peaceful purposes, but the US Defense Department has highlighted China's increasing space capabilities, saying it is pursuing activities aimed to prevent adversaries from using space-based assets in a crisis.\n\nApart from its civilian ambitions, Beijing has tested anti-satellite missiles, and the US Congress has banned NASA from engaging in cooperation with its Chinese counterpart due to security concerns.\n\nChina's space budget is still only about one-tenth of the United States' outlays, officials have said. According to Chinese state media, China spends about US$2 billion a year on its space programme, though details are vague.\n\nChina said this month that it would launch a \"core module\"for its first space station sometime around 2018, part of a plan to have a permanent manned space station in service around 2022.\n\nChina is also preparing to launch a Mars probe in 2020, which would reach the planet in 2021, the official Xinhua news agency has said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f62666859aed8d63a1d2a095ed6cff06820dc57a94a07d22ea4418ae23a9d559?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "China wants to put astronauts on the moon by 2036, a senior space official said, the latest goal in China's ambitious lunar exploration programme."}]}

Supply in April has held steady to slightly lower at about 10.15 million bpd, said three industry sources who monitor Saudi output.\n\nThe predictions may help ease market fears that Saudi Arabia could steeply add to a global glut after production-freeze talks in Qatar this month collapsed following Riyadh's refusal to sign the deal without participation by Iran.\n\nDays before the meeting, Saudi Arabia's top oil official, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said the kingdom could boost output immediately to 11.5 million bpd and go to 12.5 million in six to nine months \"if we wanted to\".\n\nSome analysts said the comments signalled a new phase in a battle for market share with Iran, which is ramping up its own exports after the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nBut Saudi-based industry sources told Reuters that Riyadh does not plan to dump more oil into the market if there is no demand.\n\nThey said the comments by Prince Mohammed were made to highlight the theoretical ability of the kingdom to raise output rather than its immediate plans. \"Eleven million bpd? No, I don't see it,\" one source said.\n\nThe sources said production would likely stay at 10.2-10.3 million bpd and could rise by some 200,000-300,000 bpd in the hot summer months to around 10.5 million.\n\nProduction often rises briefly in summer, when the kingdom burns more than 800,000 bpd to generate power as demand for air conditioning surges.\n\nState oil giant Saudi Aramco has a stated production capacity of 12 million bpd and maintains 1.5-2.0 million bpd as a cushion in case of any global supply disruption.\n\nBut production has never reached 11 million bpd. The kingdom pumped 10.56 million bpd, a record, in June last year. It kept output in March steady at 10.22 million bpd and has yet to disclose figures for April.\n\nEarlier this month, Aramco sold 730,000 barrels for June loading to Chinese refinery Shandong Chambroad Petrochemicals, one of about 20 independent refineries nicknamed\"teapots\".\n\nThis was Aramco's first spot sale to a teapot plant, but Saudi-based industry sources said such a deal should not be viewed as an escalation of any battle for market share. \"It's not unusual to sell spot,\" one of the industry sources said. \"It's basically pure demand-driven.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

The gold-silver ratio had been over 80 only a month ago, which is typically a sign silver is about to head higher.\"\n\nAn ounce of gold bought about 84 ounces of silver at the end of February, more than any time since the financial crisis of 2008. While the ratio has now dropped to the low 70s, in line with the 2015 average, it is still well above the long-term average of mid 60s, Suki Cooper and Nicholas Snowdon, analysts at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote in a report dated April 28.\n\nThe effect of the dollar weakness is far-reaching. The Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 raw materials, is heading for the biggest monthly gain since 2010. Other precious metals have rallied in April. Palladium has climbed 11 per cent and platinum is enjoying the best month since October.\n\nInvestors have piled into silver, increasing their holdings in exchange-traded funds for a third straight month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\"Silver is finally showing signs of life,\" Gavin Wendt, founding director & senior resource analyst at MineLife, said by e-mail. \"Silver usually follows gold's lead once momentum is established. It was quite simply a matter of time.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

Probably, yes. Are they making the slide into tedium worthwhile for shareholders? Maybe not.\n\nBefore the onset of the subprime crisis in the US, the three homegrown Singapore lenders - DBS, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank - used to earn a humdrum 13 per cent return on equity, compared with of 25 per cent for large banks in Hong Kong, 20 per cent in Australia and 19 per cent in the UK.\n\nThen the tables turned. While global banks had to load up on capital and drive down shareholder returns to bolster their balance sheets, strongly capitalized lenders in the Asian city-state found a great opportunity to finance China's credit bubble, as well as a red-hot property market at home.\n\nReturns on equity of the trio last year were almost double HSBC's, and approaching six times the level for UK banks as a group.\n\nThe exciting times couldn't have lasted forever, and a strong indication that they are finally over came Friday morning when OCBC disclosed that its core ROE slid from 13.2 per cent at the end of first quarter of 2015 to just 10.1 per cent.\n\nA day earlier, UOB, the smallest of the three, announced a return on equity of 10.2 per cent. DBS, the largest, will report its earnings next week, and at least one analyst is expecting a measly 10.07 per cent ROE.\n\nEven that 10 per cent floor might not hold for long. Trade financing is in the doldrums. Singapore's rig builders are starved of new orders, while the city's property market is slip-sliding away because of a glut of homes and offices in a weak economy.\n\nMeanwhile, credit costs on loans to Chinese borrowers can only increase. And amid all the chatter about how China's ICBC managed to avoid a drop in quarterly profit only by thinning down provisions for bad debt, don't forget the Singaporeans: OCBC says its total allowances are 113 per cent of nonperforming loans, down from 166 per cent in March last year.\n\nThe city-state's banks boast strong capital positions, meaning they can ride out bad times without dizzying investors with anxiety. But a single-digit ROE is too great a sacrifice to achieve a fortress-like balance sheet. The onus is on the lenders to show that they're prepared to take a hatchet to operating expenses - especially wage bills - to juice up returns. Otherwise, for shareholders, the price of boredom may not be worth paying.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM", "images": []}

Don't test our determination,\" an angry Mr Chang told reporters.\n\nThe remarks come more than three years after coastguard vessels from Taiwan and Japan converged and duelled with water cannons in a stand-off over a chain of islands in the East China Sea, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.\n\nThe islands are controlled by Japan but are claimed by both China and Taiwan.\n\nBut later that year, 2013, Japan and Taiwan set aside their sovereignty disputes and forged an agreement under which Taiwanese trawlers are permitted to fish in waters off the East China Sea island chain.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

One reason he cited is the local currency's peg to the stronger US dollar.\n\n\"That has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago,\" Mr Cook said.\n\nLuxury handbag and fashion retailers also are taking hits in the city. Burberry Group PLC sales in Hong Kong fell more than 20 per cent for a third straight quarter, and the company is seeking to reduce its local rent payments.\n\nPrada SpA, which held Hong Kong's biggest initial public offering in 2011, reported sales in Asia fell 16 per cent last year.\n\n\"The near-term outlook for retail sales will still be constrained by the weak inbound tourism performance and uncertain economic prospects,\" the Hong Kong government said after retail statistics were released in late March.\n\nLuxury Watches Choi's father is billionaire Francis Choi, whose Early Light Industrial Co Ltd makes toys for more than 30 brands, including Mattel, Hasbro, Disney and Wow Wee.\n\nEarly Light also owns properties in Hong Kong and is moving into consumer electronics and medical products to help increase profit margins, the younger Mr Choi, 30, said.\n\nHalewinner outlets sell watches from more than 40 brands, including a US$200,000 Jaeger-LeCoultre and a US$180,000 Blancpain. During an April 20 interview at a Halewinner outlet in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong's premier retail district, Mr Choi wore a steel Audemars Piguet Royal Oak timepiece priced at US$21,000.\n\nThe family acquired the watch retailer in 2010, when it had just seven stores. Now it has more than 30 outlets in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\n\nSales at its Hong Kong stores dropped 30 per cent last year amid China's economic slowdown, a government anti-corruption campaign and protests by Hong Kong residents claiming the city caters to wealthy mainland visitors at their expense.\n\nZhou Guoliang, 54, a general manager in the electronics industry from Shanghai, and his wife rarely visit Hong Kong nowadays partly because of social tensions.\n\n\"I heard Hong Kong people insult Chinese,\" said Mr Zhou. \"We come to bring consumption, and you should be nice and guide visitors.\" So he's taking his money to Macau, where he vacations three to four times a year.\n\nMr Zhou once bought a US$7,000 Omega watch and a US$6,000 necklace from Chow Sang Sang Holdings International with his winnings in Macau, although he observed the watches are slightly pricier in the Portuguese city.\n\n\"People who gamble in Macau go there particularly for amusement and fun,\" said Mr Zhou. \"I wouldn't save the money to bring it back home.\"\n\nSwiss watch exports to Hong Kong in March fell 38 per cent from a year ago, the most among major markets, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\n\nChow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd, the world's largest listed jewelry chain, and Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd reported slumping sales during the Lunar New Year holiday in February, when the number of mainland Chinese tourists to Hong Kong dropped by 26 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nShares of Chow Tai Fook Jewellery have dropped 44 per cent from a year ago, while competitor Chow Sang Sang Holdings International has declined 30 per cent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index is down 26 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nChina's economic slowdown and anti-corruption efforts also affect Macau and its US$30 billion casino industry, yet there are signs the market has hit bottom. Visitor totals for the former Portuguese colony rose 4.2 per cent last month, and a flood of new projects like the Batman Ride targets tourists and families.\n\n\"Retailers are still willing to expand in Macau because Chinese visitors will continue to come and play in the gaming hub,\" said Michael Cheng, Asia Pacific & Hong Kong/China retail & consumer partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\n\nHalewinner's 15 shops in Macau experienced a downturn last year, though Mr Choi remains bullish because \"the situation improved\" by the fourth quarter and the city is the only one in China with gambling.

Record-low interest rates have fuelled household borrowing with South Koreans actively buying and selling property.\n\nThe base policy rate is currently at 1.50 per cent.\n\nAlthough expected to remain low for a while, inflation will gradually approach the central bank's target of 2 per cent in the second half of the year, the report said, reiterating comments made by BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol earlier this month after rates were kept steady for a 10th month.\n\nLow global commodity prices have kept South Korean inflation weak, with a third cut to city gas rates this year from May 1 expected to keep the trend going.\n\nThe central bank report said that exports, which have been falling since January last year, are unlikely to recover in the near term.\n\nThe latest data for exports and inflation will be published on May 1 and 3, respectively.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

It had more than 88 million members in 2013 according to the ruling party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily, making it around the same size as the party itself.\n\nChinese elite politics are notoriously opaque, with experts and analysts picking over the smallest details of the leadership's activities - from minute variations in public language to seating arrangements at official ceremonies - for hints to the future.\n\nThe CYL's tea leaves, by contrast, have been unusually clear, with the group suffering a seemingly constant stream of attacks in recent months.\n\nMr Xi himself criticised it last July, blasting its leaders for being too \"aristocratic\", despite his own descent from so-called \"red nobility\" - his father Xi Zhongcun was a Communist military leader and later senior official.\n\nIn February, the CCDI, according to the official Xinhua news service, slammed the CYL for falling out of step with the party leadership, saying it had \"not studied the spirit of the CPC's conference on improving mass organisations\".\n\nIn the CYL's statement Monday, its leaders pledged to \"deeply study and grasp the spirit of Party Secretary Xi Jinping's major speeches\", noting that the group could only hope to achieve reform by improving its understanding of the president's teachings.\n\nEven so there is no sign of a let-up in the assault.\n\nThe Global Times reported on Thursday that following the CCDI report the CYL plans to issue a \"detailed plan\" for its own reform.\n\nMr Xi's position is clear, said He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University.\n\n\"His view on what function the CYL should play is definitely not the same as previous leaders,\" he told AFP. \"There is a conflict.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

The company sold 300 aircraft worth a record US$38 billion during President Xi Jinping's visit to the US in 2015.\n\nThe China Eastern orders come one day after Boeing reported an 8.8 per cent drop in first quarter earnings to US$1.2 billion, partly due to sluggish aircraft deliveries into a slowing global economy.\n\nChina Eastern's announcement late Thursday came alongside its first-quarter results, in which it said net profits rose 66.4 per cent year-on-year to 2.6 billion yuan (S$540 million).\n\nDai Yaxiong, an analyst at Sinolink Securities, told AFP: \"China Eastern bought the wide-body aircraft mainly to invest in its international routes as outbound travel is quite hot and the gross profit margins for international flights are much higher than domestic ones.\"\n\nFalling fuel prices were the main driver of the rise in profits, he said, adding: \"The demand for civil aviation was also quite stable.\"\n\nChina Eastern Airlines shares were down 0.81 per cent to 6.10 yuan in morning trading in Shanghai on Friday.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Asian stocks fell and crude oil traded near US$46 a barrel.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index sank to an 11-month low, while the yen was headed for its biggest weekly jump since 2008 after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly refrained from adding to record stimulus on Thursday.\n\nJapanese financial markets are shut for a holiday and an MSCI gauge of shares in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region slid for the third day in a row.\n\nThe greenback's decline is proving a plus for commodities, which are poised for their best monthly gain since 2010. Crude has jumped 20 per cent since the end of March, while gold and silver are at 15-month highs.\n\nThe BOJ's surprise decision capped a week of fence-sitting for central banks, with the Fed keeping interest rates steady for a third straight meeting and policy makers from New Zealand to Brazil also holding the line.\n\nThe slowest pace of American economic expansion in two years reignited some concern over the global outlook, and pushed out bets on the potential timeline for tighter Fed policy.\n\n\"Central banks look like they have run out of bullets to a degree,\" said Mark Lister, head of private wealth research at Craigs Investment Partners in Wellington, which manages about US$7.2 billion.\n\n\"We're getting to that point where there are limits to the results they can get from anything more they do. This points to a fragile outlook with still a lot of risks out there.\"\n\nSouth Korea's industrial output unexpectedly declined in March, while Taiwan's economy shrank more than analysts forecast in the first quarter, data showed Friday.\n\nThe euro area will release figures for gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment, while US updates on consumer confidence and household spending are also due. Russia's central bank has a policy meeting and six out of 41 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict the benchmark interest rate will be cut. The remainder forecast no change.\n\nCURRENCIES\n\nBloomberg's dollar gauge, which tracks the greenback against 10 major peers, slipped 0.3 per cent as of 12.48pm in Hong Kong and was set for a 1.7 per cent weekly loss.\n\nFunds futures show odds of the central bank boosting borrowing costs in June fell to 12 per cent following Thursday's GDP update, having held at around 21 per cent when the Fed concluded its policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe yen strengthened against all 16 major peers for the second day in a row, climbing as much as 1 per cent to 107.08 a dollar, the highest level since October 2014.\n\nIt surged 4.2 per cent this week as the BOJ defied economists' expectations that stimulus would be stepped up.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters after the review that he wants to wait and see how the introduction of negative rates in January affects the economy.\n\n\"The BOJ seems to have descended into a haze of confusion,\" said Richard Jerram, the chief economist at Bank of Singapore.\n\n\"They mismanaged expectations running up to the meeting - and that is clear from the market reaction.\"\n\nThe yuan rose less than 0.1 per cent versus the greenback after China's central bank boosted its daily reference rate by 0.6 per cent, the most since a dollar peg ended in July 2005. The steep increase in the fixing reflects the dollar's slide rather than any policy intentions, according to Ken Cheung, a currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong.\n\nSTOCKS\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index fell 0.5 per cent, headed for a 1.7 per cent weekly decline.\n\nWith the exception of Australia, benchmark shares gauges retreated across the region.\n\nFutures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average tumbled 2.6 per cent in Singapore, while contracts on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index were down 0.2 per cent.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 1.4 per cent, led by slides in energy stocks. PetroChina Co slumped 3.4 per cent after posting its first loss since it listed in 2000, while Cnooc Ltd dropped 3.1 per cent following a decrease in first- quarter revenue. Exxon Mobil Corp, the largest US energy company, and Chevron Corp are due to release their results on Friday.\n\n\"We advise clients to reduce their investments in equities and other risky assets in both developed and emerging markets,\" said Komsorn Prakobphol, a senior investment strategist in Bangkok at Tisco Financial Group Pcl.\n\n\"We expect the equities to begin some correction in the second quarter after a strong rally so far this year. Oil prices are at a level that will probably see some correction.\"\n\nCOMMODITIES\n\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Index, a measure of returns on 22 raw materials, rose 0.1 per cent, extending this month's gain to 7.7 per cent. Oil is set for its best month in a year in New York, buoyed by data this week that showed US output is at the lowest level since October 2014.\n\nGold and silver both rallied for the fifth day in a row and were headed for their highest closes since January 2015. Copper advanced 0.7 per cent in London on Friday, while zinc and lead gained at least 1 per cent.\n\nSoybean futures in Chicago are set for an 12 per cent increase this month, the most since October 2014, after heavy rains and flooding destroyed crops in South America.\n\nIron-ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange have surged 20 per cent this month, the most since the contract started in 2013, and that's prompted the authorities to clamp down on excessive speculation.\n\nBONDS\n\nThe Bloomberg US Treasury Index declined 0.3 per cent in April, set for the first monthly loss of 2016. The 10-year yield closed on Thursday at 1.82 per cent, five basis points higher than at the start of the month. Similar-maturity bonds in Japan yielded minus 0.085 per cent at the end of their final trading session in April.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/b37cbead944d05dbdb26226d86ea6f8f259977698fb603933ce8196f9f52a714?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The US dollar dropped against all of its G-10 peers after weaker-than-expected US economic growth dimmed prospects for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase at a time when monetary easing is being put on hold elsewhere."}]}

The New Zealand dollar fell to 74.82 yen, having dropped 3 yen this month.\n\nBut the Aussie managed to recoup some ground against its kiwi neighbour at NZ$1.0961, from a two-month trough of NZ$1.0914 touched twice this week.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar was trading higher after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept rates on hold on Thursday and sounded slightly less dovish than some had expected.\n\nThe Kiwi rose to US$0.6970, driven up by a number of factors to again test the US$0.70 level, ANZ Bank said in a note.\n\n\"Firstly, the USD is on the back foot and the market has concluded the Fed remains cautious. The second is that the RBNZ message was also interpreted as less dovish than before,\" ANZ said.\n\nThe kiwi was on track for a monthly increase of nearly 1 per cent in the third consecutive month of gains.\n\nDomestically news that business confidence inched higher in April added to support for the Kiwi. ANZ expected the kiwi to trade in a range of US$0.6920 to US$0.7020 in the short term.\n\nNew Zealand government bonds gained slightly with yields down 1 to 2 basis points in the middle of the curve.\n\nAustralian government bond futures were firm, with the three-year bond contract up 2 ticks at 98.160.

Separately, 90 per cent is also an ownership threshold where a stock can be suspended from trading as public float has fallen below 10 per cent.\n\nCredit Suisse is acting on behalf of Mr Sim in his privatisation bid. It said that the offeror, a special purpose vehicle owned by Mr Sim called Vision Three, can exercise its legal right of compulsory acquisition once it receives acceptances of 90 per cent of shares that it did not own pre-offer, other than those already held by the offeror, its related corporations or their respective nominees.\n\nAs Vision Three is a newly set up vehicle, it did not own any shares prior to making the offer on March 7. Mr Sim's shares do not count as a \"related corporation\", said corporate lawyer Robson Lee, partner of Gibson Dunn.\n\nAs at 5pm on Thursday, the offeror has received valid acceptances of 13.54 per cent. The offeror has acquired another 7.85 per cent, while Mr Sim and family is due to tender the 69.25 per cent of shares that they own.\n\nThis adds up to 90.64 per cent, a level at which the offeror can and will exercise his right of compulsory acquisition under section 215(1) of the Companies Act, Credit Suisse said.\n\nMr Sim's offer is due to close at 5.30pm today.\n\nAmendment note: BT had earlier reported that 97 per cent was the threshold where Mr Sim can compulsorily acquire minorities' shares.

A grimy toilet and kitchen are often shared by multiple tenants. Even these units can cost around HK$2,000.\n\nFor Ah-po, the park is a more pleasant environment and removes financial pressure - he fears his arthritis may stop him working, leaving him unable to pay the bills.\n\n\"I've got familiar with people who come here for morning exercise and we will greet each other,\" he says. \"I have a sense of belonging.\"\n\nResearch by Hong Kong universities and NGOs shows the number of homeless rose to more than 1,600 in 2015, up 14 per cent since their last survey in 2013.\n\nMore than a third have jobs.\n\n\"If they pay rent, (the accommodation) is small, it's hot, it's humid, there are many insects...If they go into the park or under the flyover it's noisy, but they can sleep,\" says Professor Wong Hung at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's department of social work.\n\nThe problem has got worse in the last two to three years as salaries have not kept up with rent hikes, Prof Wong adds.\n\nThere are long waiting lists for public housing and temporary accommodation is often on the outskirts of the city, meaning extra cost to travel to work, Wong says.\n\nNow the average age of the homeless is rising as they now tend to stay on the streets long-term.\n\nThe government says it is trying to \"reintegrate\" the homeless, with a range of services from emergency shelters to social security payments.\n\nBut campaigners argue it is not enough.\n\nAuthorities should focus on building low-cost dorms in urban areas where homeless people could settle for two or three years, says Ng Wai-tung, of the Society For Community Organisation (SOCO), a Hong Kong NGO helping the poor.\n\n\"It's very sad that people can't afford to rent a place even though they have work,\" says Mr Ng.\n\nIn a sign of increasing desperation, some of the city's poor are now turning to 24-hour fast-food restaurants for shelter.\n\nThe plight of these \"McRefugees\" was highlighted when a homeless woman was discovered slumped dead over a table in a McDonald's restaurant last year.\n\nOne former McDonald's sleeper, Angelina Sun, 56, says she stayed there overnight for several weeks when she split from her husband, jobless and afraid of being a burden on friends and family.\n\nShe now earns around HK$8,000 each month in a factory and is in temporary accommodation in a Christian-run female dormitory.\n\n\"The rental outside the dormitory is very high, even for a small studio,\" says Angelina.\n\nShe is resigned to paying half her salary for a tiny unit when her dormitory place expires.\n\n\"There will be no money left for entertainment, clothes, but I can make ends meet. I can survive,\" she said.\n\nFor others, McDonald's has become home - retired factory worker Ko Wing-kam, 62, regularly sleeps there to avoid the bedsit he shares with nine strangers.\n\n\"I'm not happy with the situation, but there's nothing I can do,\" he says.\n\nAt the football stands, Ah-po is laying out his bed.\n\nHe has not told his family he is homeless. It is only after dark that he contemplates his fate.\n\n\"When I work, I'm ok. But when I come back after dinner, I will think about my ex-wife, daughter and family members,\" he says, staring across the dimly lit park.\n\n\"I feel hopeless.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

It has also said it will scale down tax exemptions and promised to simplify revenue collection.\n\nThe IMF said the Sri Lankan government will seek to raise its tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 per cent by 2020 from the current level of 11 per cent.\n\nSchneider said the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Sri Lanka was expected to \"catalyse an additional US$650 million in other multilateral and bilateral loans, bringing total support to about US$2.2 billion\".\n\nAn EFF is designed to help countries resolve serious balance of payment problems brought on by structural weaknesses in the economy.\n\nSri Lanka enjoyed a blistering economic growth rate averaging more than 8.0 per cent for two years after a prolonged civil war ended in 2009.\n\nBut the pace of expansion has since slowed, falling to 4.8 per cent in 2015, down from 4.9 in the previous year, according to official data.\n\nThe new government in Colombo sought an IMF bailout immediately after taking power in January last year, but the fund turned down the request, saying the country's reserves were at a comfortable level then.\n\nHowever, the government faced a balance of payments crisis after the government went on a huge spending spree to implement its election pledges of higher public sector salaries and lower prices.\n\nIn 2009, Sri Lanka received US$2.6 billion from the IMF to boost its financial reserves, which dropped below US$1 billion at the height of fighting between Tamil Tiger rebels and troops.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

By then, the North-South and East-West rail systems will be \"virtually new\" after all upgrading works have been completed, said SMRT chairman and group chief executive officer Desmond Kuek.\n\n\"By the time we have completed all these multi-year projects, we'll see a virtually new North-South and East-West lines, and we expect this to take two to three years before we can complete all our renewal projects,\" he said.\n\nMr Kuek detailed the timelines of upgrading projects at a briefing on Friday morning, as SMRT reported that earnings from rail operations swung into the red for financial year 2016. The loss was at S$9.6 million, while there was a profit of S$9.6 million in FY15.\n\nThe last to be completed of all these upgrading projects is expected to be the upgrading of the power system.\n\nMr Kuek on Friday said that SMRT has been working on \"power expansion programmes\" from last year, and the project is expected to complete by 2019.\n\nBut \"recent events\" have prompted the operator to work with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to see how they can expedite the process, said Mr Kuek.\n\nOn Monday evening at rush hour, a power fault crippled four SMRT lines. The North-South and East-West lines were disrupted for about half an hour, and the Circle Line for about an hour during rush hour, while the Bukit Panjang LRT only functioned after a two-hour delay.\n\nAside from upgrading its power system, SMRT is also expecting signalling works to be completed for the North-South line by early next year, and in 2018 for the East-West line, said Mr Kuek.\n\nReplacing of sleepers on the tracks for the North-South line have been completed, with those on the East-West line to be replaced by early next year.\n\nUpgrading of the power-supplying third rail system, to be distinguished from the power expansion upgrade, is ongoing, added Mr Kuek.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We've been adding risk in the last few months and coming into the summer, we will take it away and wait for opportunities to add again. We are not yet ready for China's structural story because earnings haven't come through.\"\n\nInvestor interest in the world's second-largest equity market is waning, with turnover on the Shanghai Stock Exchange falling to levels last seen regularly in 2014 and a gauge of volatility dropping to a 12-month low.\n\nInvestments in stock-market funds fell by 89 billion yuan (S$18.47 billion) in April, according to data from Shanghai-based research firm Z-Ben Advisors.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings aren't proving much of a draw. Of the 171 Shanghai-listed companies that have reported three-month figures and are tracked by Bloomberg, 57 per cent have missed analyst expectations. PetroChina Co, the biggest weighting on the benchmark gauge, posted its first quarterly loss since the company listed in 2000, while China Life Insurance Co reported a 57 per cent drop in net income.\n\nThe bond market is also looking shakier than at the start of the month. The five-year government yield has increased from a six-year low of 2.47 per cent on April 1, while the Bank of America Merrill Lynch China Broad Market Index of total returns on yuan-denominated debt has declined 1 per cent from a record high on April 4.\n\nGovernment bonds are coming under pressure as inflation increased to the highest since mid-2014, while corporate notes are slumping amid a spate of defaults and a surprise move by state-owned China Railway Materials Co to halt its bond trading this month because of what the company called \"repayment issues.\"\n\n\"We will definitely see more defaults and difficulties for corporates in issuing new bonds,\" said David Gaud, who helps oversee US$61 billion as a fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Credit costs will go up and credit spreads will widen. Your return is too low for your risk in China.\"\n\nAt least 103 Chinese firms postponed or scrapped 117.4 billion yuan of planned note sales this month through April 25. The yield premium on three-year AA-rated local bonds, considered junk in China, over government debt widened 43 basis points in April, the most since 2014.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Mr Taylor forecasts China's economy will grow 6 per cent this year, below the government's target range of 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent, and targets the yuan to fall to 6.9 a dollar by the end of the year - implying a 6.1 per cent drop from Thursday's level.\n\nThe onshore currency was 0.1 per cent higher at 6.4740 per dollar on Thursday, after a plunge in the dollar late Thursday prompted the central bank to strengthen the fixing by the most since a peg was dismantled in 2005.\n\nA Bloomberg replica of the CFETS RMB Index, which measures the yuan against 13 exchange rates, dropped 0.2 per cent to a 17-month low, defying government pledges of \"stability\" against the basket.\n\n\"All markets are looking a little tired\" after a good run in March, said Andrew Clarke, Hong Kong-based director of trading at Mirabaud Asia Ltd. \"People are taking money off the table at all asset classes. We don't need to speculate for now.\"\n\nOne area where speculation has been evident is the commodities market, where trading spikes prompted exchanges in Shanghai, Dalian and Zhengzhou to boost fees or issue warnings to investors.\n\nThe equivalent of 41 million bales of cotton traded in a single day on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange last week, the most in more than five years, while daily volumes of iron ore futures exceeded annual imports, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nSpeculators now appear to be retreating. The value of futures traded across the nation's three biggest commodity exchanges has shrunk 42 per cent since investors spent 1.7 trillion yuan last Thursday on everything from steel bars to eggs.\n\n\"They just got out of hand,\" said Mr Clarke. \"People are looking for different markets to play at the expense of the equity market. If people start to lose on margins, the same as when they lost money in the stock market, the impact will be on the property, equity or bond markets where they have to liquidate to make up for losses in commodities.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Who is looking after them?\" the New Zealander told AFP.\n\nAn avalanche that ripped through Everest in 2014, killing 16 Nepalis, underscored the risks borne by sherpas who ascend icy slopes, weighed down by tents, ropes and food for clients.\n\nAfter the first summit in 1953 by sherpa Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, Everest was dominated for decades by Western expedition companies.\n\nWestern operators offered mostly foreign climbers a chance to fullfil their dream of scaling the 8,848-metre (29,029-foot) high peak for US$45,000 to US$79,000.\n\nAs the industry grew, sherpas, an ethnic group thought to be of Tibetan origin and known for their climbing skills, became indispensable as guides and porters.\n\nBut over the last five years, local climbing companies, many run by former guides and porters, have shaken up Nepal's mountaineering market, offering cheaper, no-frills expeditions.\n\nLeading Western companies secured only 119 climbing permits this season - which is resuming after a deadly avalanche hit base camp last year and which usually runs until end-May - less than half the total number allocated.\n\nNepali firms don't hire foreign guides and therefore avoid paying the US$11,000 government fee for climbing permits, a cost that has traditionally been passed onto clients.\n\nMany have also scaled back on luxuries like WiFi and expensive batteries to power clients' smartphones and laptops.\n\nBut according to some, operators are also lowering costs through using cheap labour - by emptying remote Himalayan villages of young men who see a job on Everest as their way out of poverty.\n\nNepal's tourism department chief Sudarshan Prasad Dhakal said the government was not aware of such concerns, while some locals say the Westerners have sour grapes after years of earning large sums on Everest.\n\nMingma Sherpa is one guide who uses inexperienced villagers on his expeditions to Everest, taking on up to 25 fresh faces every season.\n\nMr Sherpa, owner of local company, Seven Summit Treks, rejects the safety claims, saying his youngsters start at the bottom and meticulously learn from their peers, rather than undertaking formal training courses.\n\n\"I am offering these young men a chance to learn... there is no safety issue because they are not going to guide clients, they are carrying loads,\" Mr Sherpa said.\n\n\"They will learn on the job from other sherpas like I did... all this technical training about safety and danger is of no use to us,\" he told AFP.\n\nMr Sherpa himself started carrying loads on trekking routes as a teenager before moving on to high-altitude work that saw him become the first Nepali to summit all 14 of the world's peaks above 8,000 metres.\n\nMr Sherpa is taking 45 clients to Everest this season and none are required to have high-altitude experience. Anyone \"in good physical shape\" can climb Everest because plenty of skilled sherpas are on hand to help, he said.\n\n\"The only difference between climbing a small mountain and Everest is the need for oxygen, which we provide. Anyone can do this,\" he said.\n\nBut Dawa Steven Sherpa, managing director of another local firm, Asian Trekking, among the oldest operators in the Himalayas, said he is increasingly worried.\n\n\"The combination of untrained sherpas and inexperienced climbers is a lethal cocktail but luckily there are better-equipped companies to rally around in case of accidents,\" he told AFP.\n\nFor Mr Benegas, who has led many rescue efforts on Everest over the years, the situation is grim.\n\n\"This is their country, their mountain - they have a right to do what they want but we need to be honest about the cost,\" he said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

They are trying to lay the groundwork to have all but the thorniest problems solved by the autumn.\n\nAmong the deepest divides concern Europe's food safety rules that exclude American beef raised with hormones, genetically modified foods and Europe's many local food naming rules, such as for asiago and feta cheeses.\n\nUS negotiators have complained those rules have fueled a US$12 billion annual food trade deficit with the EU, US$1 billion in cheese alone.\n\nTeamsters union legislative representative Michael Dolan told a forum for industry, labour and other trade stakeholders on Tuesday that he believed the two sides were too entrenched on some key issues and that those should be excluded. He recommended leaving out the food safety standards and naming rules, known as \"geographical indications.\"\n\nSimilarly, he said a deal should exclude European demands for greater access to US federal, state and local government procurement, which often carries \"buy American\" or local content standards. \"Agree to disagree on government procurement,\" Dolan said.\"Geographic indications? Not on the menu.\"\n\nAn EU official told reporters that European negotiators were disappointed in the latest US procurement offer but were determined to keep working toward a deal.\n\n\"We are obviously working hard to see where we can try to conclude these negotiations before the change of administration, without in any way compromising the substance of this agreement,\" the official said. \"We don't believe in a 'TTIP light.'\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/4fc212e99e8c616ca99ef691d6fb62a53e8e90e20dee7b3cbed3a555a3e24f81?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "US and European Union trade officials said on Thursday they would not settle for a limited trans-Atlantic free trade deal that ignores deep divisions on agricultural products, services, public procurement and dispute resolution."}]}

Support to the police,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nParis police chief Michel Cadot said highly organised \"groups of hooligans\" were behind the \"inexcusable acts of violence\".\n\nThe clashes came as at least 170,000 workers and students took to streets nationwide Thursday in a new push for the withdrawal of the proposed labour law.\n\nThe demonstrations as well as work stoppages, notably in the aviation and public transport sectors, were the latest actions in a protest wave that began two months ago and has proved a major headache for the French government.\n\nOpponents of the labour reform, billed as an effort to reduce chronic unemployment - which stands at 10 per cent overall - say it will threaten cherished workers' rights and deepen job insecurity for young people.\n\n\"Be Young and Shut Up!\" read one banner at a protest in southwestern Toulouse, highlighting the frustration of youths facing an unemployment rate of 25 per cent.\n\n\"Over the past 10 years or so things have deteriorated horribly for young people,\" said retiree Gilles Cavaliere at the Lyon protest.\n\nAlso Thursday, striking aviation workers caused one in five flights to be cancelled at Paris's Orly airport, while delays were reported at Charles de Gaulle airport.\n\nAnd newsstands were devoid of national dailies after printers downed tools.\n\nThe unions and student organisations plan to pile on the pressure with further protests on Sunday to mark the May Day labour holiday, as well as next Tuesday, when parliament begins debating the bill.\n\nChristophe Sirugue, the Socialist lawmaker who is presenting the bill to parliament after it was reviewed in committee, said Thursday that several points still needed \"clarification\" but that he expected the bill to pass.\n\nAmong the remaining issues are measures to make it easier to lay off workers in lean times, and whether employers should still be allowed to shed workers if conditions are depressed in their overseas operations and not just in France.\n\nAnother is a proposed surtax on short-term contracts aimed at getting employers to hire more people on permanent contracts, Mr Sirugue told reporters.\n\nYoung people have been at the forefront of the protest movement, with many young workers stuck on short-term contracts or internships while hoping to secure a permanent job.\n\nProtests against the reform kicked off on March 9, culminating in massive demonstrations on March 31 that brought 390,000 people on to the streets, according to an official count. Organisers put the number at 1.2 million.\n\nThe CGT union said Thursday's marches and rallies drew half a million people.\n\nThe protests spawned a new youth-led movement called \"Nuit Debout\" (Up All Night), which has seen advocates of a broad spectrum of causes gather in city squares at night for the past four weeks to demand change, though attendance has been dwindling in recent days.\n\nWith little more than a year left in his mandate, France's deeply unpopular President Francois Hollande has been banking on the labour reform as a standout initiative with which to defend his record.\n\nBut in the face of the protests his Socialist government has watered down the labour reforms - only to anger bosses while failing to assuage workers.\n\n\"The current bill, which is totally unacceptable, spells insecurity and social setbacks for workers and youths,\" a joint union statement said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/9bbf30415d897f3abdfa2915dd61bbc15dbc55cf3e13e876a9404cf6a1e29cd1?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Two dozen police officers were wounded on Thursday, three of them seriously, as violence flared in protests across France against a hotly contested labour reforms bill."}]}

It owns 15 hotels, two resorts and a retail mall comprising a total of 4,909 rooms.\n\nIt said that net property income (NPI) stood at S$33.7 million for Q1, a decline of 2.3 per cent from a year ago.\n\nContributions from Singapore hotels and Maldives resorts declined due to the soft trading environment, while Australia hotels recorded lower rent contribution due to local currency weakness against the Singapore dollar and a smaller variable income for FY 2015.\n\nThe decline in NPI was mitigated by inorganic contribution from Hilton Cambridge City Centre and higher rent contribution from the New Zealand hotel due to the recognition of a full year variable income of S$0.5 million for the first time, triggered by strong revenue performance in FY 2015.\n\nTotal income available for distribution (after deducting income retained for working capital) was S$21.9 million, down S$2 million, or 8.5 per cent from a year ago. This excludes contribution from the Japan hotels, which is only available for distribution in the second quarter once the financial results of the group's Japanese subsidiary for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2016 are audited.\n\nVincent Yeo, chief executive officer of CDLHT's managers, said that the weak global economy has given rise to a challenging operating environment.\n\n\"Although there has been some improvement in visitor arrivals, corporate expenditure remains constrained which has affected our core Singapore portfolio performance.\"\n\nHe noted that the performance has also been affected by the group's ongoing asset enhancement initiatives at Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel and M Hotel which are slated for completion in 2016.\n\n\"However, we believe that by augmenting our assets at this opportune time, it will enhance their competitive position and allow them to capitalise on the positive mid-to-long term outlook of Singapore tourism sector,\" Mr Yeo said.\n\nRevenue per available room (RevPAR) for its Singapore hotels fell by 6.9 per cent from a year ago to S$161 mainly due to the competitive trading environment induced by new hotel room supply and an uncertain economic outlook. The renovation at M Hotel and Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, coupled with weak corporate demand experienced by the group, had affected the performance of the Singapore hotels. The Easter holiday in March this year compared with April last year also affected trading performance as corporate activity is generally more subdued during the holiday periods.\n\nThe outlook for the hospitality sector in Singapore remains uncertain.

The latest hotspot is Sarawak, where a RM28.9 billion, 1,796-kilometre toll-free highway linking the state and Sabah is being built as a crucial state election looms in May.\n\n\"The construction industry will be very exciting as these jobs are expected to be awarded in the next two years. There could be as much as RM200 billion ringgit of jobs out there,\" said Mr Wong, CEO of Areca Capital Sdn, who correctly predicted this year's slump in tech shares and a rebound in energy companies.\n\n\"We can't ignore them. Sarawak stocks are in focus because of the Pan Borneo highway and also the election, where there are bound to be goodies.\"\n\nConstruction firms are trading at the highest level relative to the Malaysian equity benchmark in four years as a building boom takes hold. With an estimated RM136 billion of jobs in the pipeline in 2016, a CIMB Group Holdings Bhd report predicts more gains as share prices haven't fully priced in the earnings potential.\n\nThe awards bonanza from rail to roads also comes amid an \"election play\" on some contractors as Prime Minister Najib Razak's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition bids to retain Sarawak - a state held since 1963 - in polls on May 7.\n\nThe Bursa Malaysia Construction Index has risen 21 per cent from an August 2015 low and is priced at 1.2 times net assets - near the most expensive level in almost a year. It's up 3.2 per cent in 2016, beating the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index that's fallen 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe biggest gainers in the building gauge this year are Ekovest Bhd and Kimlun Corp which have jumped at least 28 per cent. The building gauge rose 0.1 per cent on Thursday, its second day of increases.\n\nHock Seng Lee, Sarawak's largest builder, has surged 15 per cent from its August low, while Zecon Bhd has rallied 33 per cent from the lowest level last September.

The recommendation to cut holdings comes after Citigroup Inc singled out the zloty as among the hardest hit from a potential loss of subsidies, while Societe Generale SA cautioned against Hungarian local bonds and the forint in the run-up to the UK's June 23 referendum.\n\n\"Before June 23, markets are likely to trade cautiously in my view, which is why I made the adjustments.\" said Simon Quijano-Evans, Commerzbank's chief emerging-market strategist in London. \"I expect them to underperform versus others.\"\n\nStrategists have grown more wary toward eastern Europe as Britain's departure threatens billions of euros in EU funding that poorer countries use to build highways and other infrastructure, as well as potentially limiting the funds sent home by workers in the UK as migration becomes restricted. Bonds from Poland, Hungary and Romania have underperformed most of their emerging peers this month amid warnings from central bankers that the vote may spur market turbulence.\n\nEU RELIANCE\n\nMr Quijano-Evans cut his recommendation Poland's local currency bonds to underweight to match its stance on the country's Eurobonds. He lowered Hungary's foreign-currency and forint notes, as well as Croatian Eurobonds, to market weight, according to an April 27 report.\n\nThe brokerage raised Brazilian and Thai domestic debt to market weight.\n\nBrexit poses risks because of the \"negative implications this could have for flows from the EU budget and also net remittances\" Mr Quijano-Evans said April 28.\n\nPoland, Hungary, Romania and Czech Republic rely on EU subsidies to underpin growth. With its US$545 billion economy and 38 million people, Poland is scheduled to receive 114.7 billion euros (S$154.3 billion) of funds between 2014 and 2020, the most of all 28 states in the bloc, the EU website shows.\n\nThe UK was the third-largest net contributor in 2014, adding 7.1 billion euros to the budget, according data from the Treasury in London.\n\nHAVEN STATUS\n\nWhile Britain's exit from the EU is a \"marginal consideration,\" local assets in central and eastern Europe are vulnerable to Brexit, which can temporarily weaken their haven perception compared with emerging-market peers, Societe Generale said in a March report.\n\n\"Trading will be choppy ahead of the event in line with the roller coaster reflected by the polls,\" Roxana Hulea, an emerging-market strategist at Societe Generale in London, said on April 28. \"Hungarian government bonds and forint rates tended to trade disconnected to peers and outperforming the region, and we think they are most likely to sell off.\"\n\nCitigroup's Luis Costa said Brexit risks add another \"layer of complexity\" to Poland, where fixed-income instruments don't trade well anymore and \"economic policy is still flirting with market-unfriendly measures.\" Poland's currency has been the worst-performer among major emerging markets this month, sliding 3.6 per cent against the euro.\n\nZloty-denominated sovereign bonds handed investors losses of 4.7 per cent in dollar terms in April, the most among 31 nations in the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Sovereign Index. Romanian and Hungarian notes have also declined, compared with gains for Turkey and Russia.\n\n\"For now, I think it's sentiment-related, the fear of the unknown,\" said Richard Segal, a London-based emerging-market analyst at Manulife Asset Management, who prefers Serbian and Croatian assets and is less optimistic about Poland.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

This also comes as Singapore ramps up its fintech (financial technology) and smart nation drive, with a view to using technology and big data to boost efficiencies in the city-state.\n\nSingapore can be the \"lighthouse\" in attempts to commercialise a new form of innovation, before such solutions are scaled globally, said EDB chairman Beh Swan Gin at the opening ceremony. \"Singapore, under the leadership of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has embarked on a journey to build a smart financial centre, where technology will be used pervasively to increase efficiency, create new opportunities and better manage risks,\" said Dr Beh. \"We are working closely with MAS to develop an ecosystem for innovation.\"\n\nVisa's new innovation centre, built for an undisclosed sum, takes up an additional 7,000 square feet, or another floor of office space. It is a space to allow clients, partners and startups to work with Visa to build e-commerce applications.\n\n\"It is, in some ways, existential for Visa,\" said Jim McCarthy, global head of innovation and strategic partnerships for Visa, in Singapore, noting that the company wants to be plug itself into the various forms of payment platforms that have emerged.\n\nDigital payment ideas are particularly relevant in this part of the world, as many small businesses remain underserved by financial institutions.\n\nIn the future, tuk-tuk drivers in South-east Asia may be able to accept payment from tourists through their phones - another idea Visa is testing.\n\nThe traditional setup for businesses is to be backed by a merchant bank connecting them to the payments network. Today, mobile phone proliferation has allowed small-time retailers to direct payments via stored-value accounts. In emerging markets, mobile networks can also link prepaid mobile plans to payment services, essentially turning prepaid minutes into currency, said Mr McCarthy. When such stored-value accounts are linked to open networks such as that of Visa, small-time businesses can access global, and established, channels to process payment.\n\nRegulations are also supporting such a cashless movement in Asia, which should be more efficient, and safer, said TS Anil, Visa's head of products for the Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe biggest lessons for digital payments come from China, where mobile payment is ubiquitous. Facebook is working to create the WeChat of the West in embedding payment options into the chat function, said Matt Dill, head of Singapore's Visa innovation centre. Visa, which does not have a licence to operate domestically in China yet, is keeping tabs on the \"fascinating\" market, Mr Dill said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Spending on structures fell for a third straight quarter.\n\nConsumer spending, which typically accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity, rose only 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, the weakest growth since a year ago.\n\nConsumer spending on goods was flat, up a bare 0.1 per cent. Purchases of durable goods fell 1.6 percent, dragged down in part by slowing auto purchases.\n\nExports fell under pressure from a strong dollar and weak demand in the cooling global economy. Federal government spending also fell, including a hefty drop in defence spending.\n\nThe housing market remained a bright spot in the economy. Spending on home purchases jumped nearly 15 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest advance since late 2102.\n\nInflation, based on the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of core consumer prices excluding food and energy, jumped to an annual rate of 1.9 per cent, near its 2.0 per cent target.\n\nAnalysts said the data reinforces the Fed's cautious approach to raising interest rates. The Fed kept key interest rates unchanged Wednesday, citing slower growth.\n\nBut the Fed, noting the strong jobs market, also forecast that economic activity \"will expand at a moderate pace\" over the rest of the year.\n\nChris Low of FTN Financial said the Fed \"is right to be cautious.\" \"So far, companies are still investing in human capital, but ongoing employment growth cannot be a sure thing given the extent of the weakness in business investment,\" he said.\n\n\"There is not yet anything in the data to suggest the rebound will be anywhere near as strong as last spring's.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Their ultimate success, however, will depend on avoiding some of the pitfalls that still dog the German power market including high retail prices, weakened former state utilities, and high use of coal.\n\nSparked by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami which highlighted problems in transferring electricity across regions and led to the shutdown of nuclear reactors, the reforms are part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plans to boost an economy in the doldrums.\n\nFrom April 1, the government ended regional monopolies that were formed after World War Two, opening up retail gas and electricity markets to competition. It hopes the changes will help create a thriving wholesale market, driving down prices for industrial and retail customers alike.\n\nIn the first month of the new marketplace, more than 740,000 Japanese retail electricity users switched to new suppliers, according to the national grid monitor OCCTO, and wholesale trading volumes on the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) surged, albeit from a tiny base.\n\n\"The number of customers switching is encouraging and the pick-up in JEPX activity levels is also welcome news as building capacity in the wholesale market will be key to ensuring success in liberalised markets,\" said Tom O'Sullivan of energy consultancy Mathyos Japan.\n\nHowever, Japan needs to avoid the problems that beset Germany's liberalisation, particularly a collapse in wholesale power prices due to a flood of subsidised green energy that gutted its big utilities.\n\n\"They are very cognizant of what has happened in Germany. They have been in there, they met government officials and industry practitioners,\" Mr O'Sullivan said. \"I think the chances of success are 50/50 at this stage.\"\n\nGERMANY: MODEL OR WARNING?\n\nJapan and Germany's power markets share many similarities - declining demand, subsidies for renewable energy, a dormant or declining nuclear sector, and energy-intensive industries.\n\nGermany's experience, however, has reaped mixed results.\n\nHuge subsidies mean renewable energy sources account for nearly a third of the power mix, but the capacity glut has cut wholesale prices by 70 per cent since 2008. This drove down costs for the country's chemical, automobile and other industries, but slashed revenues for major utilities.\n\nSmaller businesses and households, however, have been hit with steep retail costs in order to finance renewable subsidies, while industry enjoys a raft of exemptions.\n\nJapan, too, has posted explosive growth in subsidised renewable energy, particularly solar, since preferential rates were introduced in 2012. Solar now meets as much as 10 per cent of power demand.\n\nCritics say subsidies must be rolled back fast to avoid the creation of a renewables capacity glut that erodes wholesale power prices and, with it, revenues for conventional power plant operators.\n\n\"When renewables are 3 per cent of the power mix, they need support payments, but when they reach 20 per cent, you have to make the change towards supporting capacity only by competitive means,\" Peter Reitz, chief executive of Germany's EEX , told Reuters.\n\nIn Germany, renewable subsidies, taxes and other government levies accounted for 54 per cent of retail power prices last year, and within that supporting feed-in tariffs was the biggest single item totalling 24 billion euros ($27 billion).\n\nIn Japan, government sanctioned preferential rates for renewable energy supplies added about 1.3 trillion yen (S$15.7 billion) to electricity bills in the year through March, double the year earlier, according to the industry ministry.\n\nWith their revenues eroded, German utilities have switched to using the cheapest form of generation, meaning that a country that is proud of its green energy revolution still relies on the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal, to meet about 40 percent of demand.\n\nIn Japan, coal use has also hit records as utilities similarly switched to the cheapest substitute for nuclear, with thermal coal imports rsing for a fourth straight year in 2015.\n\nThe country has, however, moved to cut the price of its subsidies for renewables to reflect lower input prices, with some tarriffs down by more than a quarter since 2012.\n\nThe public is broadly seen as behind the reforms to build a greener economy and a decentralised power system.\n\nTokyo Electric Power (Tepco), meanwhile, has so far lost about 2 per cent of its customers.

Facebook has yet to try to generate sales from newer chat applications like WhatsApp, which has one billion users, and Messenger, which has 900 million. Instagram, the photo-sharing app that opened up to advertising globally last year, is still early in its financial potential, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zuckerberg is investing in other, more ambitious bets, including virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. With the new stock structure, \"I'll be able to keep founder control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term.\"\n\nProfit excluding some items was 77 cents per share, the company said on Wednesday in a statement, compared with the 63-cent average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Facebook is benefiting by owning some of the more popular mobile applications, with the average user spending 50 minutes a day on its properties, excluding WhatsApp, the company said.\n\nWith Instagram and video, \"they've got these two huge tailwinds to their business\", Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said before the results. \"But if you own Facebook stock you're not buying it now because of what they can do with video ads or Instagram, you're buying it because of the potential with their long-term bets like virtual reality.\"\n\nThe new stock structure, if approved, will encourage Mr Zuckerberg to remain involved in a leadership role at Facebook, even after pledging to give away most of his stock, the company said in a regulatory filing.\n\nFacebook's main competitor, Alphabet Inc, issued a special share class in 2014 that gives founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin a similar mix of company control and freedom to back risky new technologies. While some of Alphabet's new bets have stumbled, Facebook must keep up to attract talented engineers capable of inventing new products and businesses.\n\nInvestors seemed initially supportive of the new share class idea. Facebook stock jumped 10 per cent to US$118.60 in after-hours trading, putting it on course for a record when regular trading opens on Thursday.\n\n\"A large part of Facebook's success is due to Mark's leadership and this proposal will allow us to maintain that founder-led approach that has served our shareholders well,\" chief financial officer David Wehner said.\n\nThe strong performance of Facebook's existing and emerging businesses is keeping most investors happy for now. Adding ads to Instagram is expected to drive US$1.53 billion in revenue this year, or 15 per cent of the company's ad sales, according to eMarketer. Facebook is expected to take about 18 per cent of the US$102.5 billion mobile advertising market this year, eMarketer said. The company has also been investing in live video streaming and media content, aiming to make Facebook more of a place to find out what's going on right now.\n\nThe company reported US$1.51 billion in first-quarter net income, or 52 cents a share, almost triple what it made in the same period a year earlier.\n\nCFO Mr Wehner said the main drivers of Facebook's first-quarter results were video and mobile ads on the company's main Facebook app. He described Instagram as \"still early\". Much of Zuckerberg's attention these days is focused on longer-term initiatives. At a developer conference earlier this month, he laid out a 10-year vision. In the next couple years, he said, Facebook's messaging products are going to usher in an age of talking to businesses through artificially intelligent bots, replacing the need to call them or download their app. Meanwhile, Facebook will work towards a future where virtual reality is at the centre of social interactions, allowing people to hang out with anyone in the world via an Oculus headset and feel a sense of presence. Longer term, Facebook is working on connecting the rest of the world to the Internet using a mix of radio technology, lasers and drones, expanding the number of people who can use Facebook's services.\n\nNot all the company's newer initiatives are going smoothly. Those who pre-ordered Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets this year complained of shipping delays. Attempts to spread the Internet through a \"free basics\" application in India were blocked by the government, which said the app violated net neutrality rules.

In 2014, the last year for which information was available, 32,675 people died in car accidents.\n\nMr Rosekind said that more than 90 per cent of vehicle accidents every year were the result of decisions made by drivers at the wheel - and self-driving technology had the potential to prevent at least some of those accidents.\n\n\"We are focused on promoting safety innovation that can do the most to save lives,\" he said.\n\nCarmakers are already putting some self-driving features, like automatic braking and steering, in current models. But the coalition led by Ford and Google is urging swift passage of regulations that allow for totally autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn addition to Ford and Google, the coalition includes Swedish carmaker Volvo and ride-sharing firms Lyft and Uber.\n\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford's involvement with Google was not an indication that the two companies were working together on a driverless car. Other carmakers, including General Motors and Toyota, testified separately at the hearing. A Toyota official, in particular, suggested that regulators hold off on setting requirements for self-driving technology until it's introduced in the market.\n\nOthers that expressed support for self-driving cars included those speaking for disabled persons who cannot operate a vehicle, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which noted that driverless cars could reduce the number of accidents that involve alcohol consumption.

This year, the focus was on the firm's growing consumer products business.\n\nWilmar's oilseeds and grains segment, where most non-sugar consumer businesses are parked, recorded profit before tax of almost US$700 million in 2015, almost double from 2014. The results were due to higher consumer products sales volumes and better soybean crushing margins.\n\nChina is Wilmar's largest consumer market. There, the company has a market share of around 45 per cent for consumer pack edible oils, in part due to its flagship Arawana brand of blended oils. The company also sells flour, noodles, grains, soy milk powder drinks and condiments through more than 1,200 distributors, he said.\n\nIn India, Wilmar's second biggest market, it has an over 20 per cent market share in consumer pack edible oils, through its flagship Fortune brand.\n\nIn Indonesia, Wilmar has expanded into the flour, bar soap and margarine business in the last two years, he said.\n\nIn Vietnam, where Wilmar is the top producer of consumer pack edible oils, its flour business introduced last year is \"doing well\".\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Wilmar started marketing sauces last year. In Russia, Wilmar is the \"number one for table margarine and mayonnaise\".\n\nMr Kuok said the African continent is one of Wilmar's fastest-growing markets. Apart from oil, margarine and shortening, the firm has started marketing rice and sugar there.\n\nLast March, the company also completed its joint acquisition of Australian food company Goodman Fielder. Goodman is profitable but not in a significant way yet, Mr Kuok said.\n\nWilmar has major cultivation, processing and trading businesses, but the consumer products line has the highest potential because of its income stability, Mr Kuok said.\n\n\"If we want to become a much bigger company, we have to become a major consumer products company.\"\n\nWilmar is currently trading at a market capitalisation of around S$23 billion. Mr Kuok noted how major global consumer products companies like Nestle and Unilever are worth S$200 billion to S$300 billion. \"Maybe we cannot aspire to that kind of market cap, but maybe 50 to 60 billion in the next 10 years,\" he said.\n\nHis strategy to grow is to keep distribution and marketing costs low through an extensive distribution network and high sales volumes.\n\nHe also said he plans to list part or all of its China operations in the future \"when we get really big\".\n\nAt the company's AGM earlier in the morning, chief financial officer Ho Kiam Kong noted that an accounting amendment that comes into effect this year will mean its biological assets being revalued downwards by almost US$1 billion, from US$1.8 billion to just over US$800 million.\n\nPalm tree trunks are now fixed assets to be valued at cost instead of fair value, while fruits can be still revalued at fair value.\n\nThus on about 240,000 hectares of planted area, Wilmar's palm oil plantations are now valued on its books at roughly US$3,300 a hectare, close to their original costs, he said. This is conservative given how some deals have been done at US$10,000 a hectare, Mr Ho said.\n\nMr Kuok also addressed shareholder queries on a range of issues. He said prominent public intellectual Kishore Mahbubani joined the board this year as an independent director to help advise on the political situation in various countries that Wilmar operates or plans to operate in.\n\nOn why there is no need to rotate external auditor Ernst and Young after 10 years, he said they can do a good job because they are familiar with the business. He also quipped: \"They are cheap and good.\"\n\nWilmar closed at S$3.66, up two cents or 0.5 per cent, on Thursday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Short-term stays here are allowed for serviced apartments, which are under residential zoning, and hotels with its own designated land use zoning.\n\n\"CEA and URA have been investigating the cases cited by The Business Times,\" said CEA acting deputy director (licensing) Chua Geck Siang in response to a BT query.\n\nBT had flagged earlier this month that some accommodation service providers could have got around URA's minimum-stay requirement for residential properties by clever wording of their tenancy agreements.\n\nStandard contracts seen by BT, such as those issued by Uncharted Homes on behalf of BS Shenton Pte Ltd, contain a minimum lease of six months but with a diplomatic clause allowing for early termination without penalty. Another accommodation service provider, LMB Housing Services, issues an open-ended contract that states a minimum lease of six months without indicating the last date of stay, and allows the tenant to terminate the lease without penalty by submitting a termination letter 30 days before departure date.\n\nBut URA has clarified that there is a breach as long as residential units are rented out for under six months.\n\nOther accommodation service providers cited in the BT articles include International Service Apartments and Atas Residence, formerly known as OSPC (Overseas Students Placement Centre) Pte Ltd. Besides these, there are many other service providers that offer rental for less than six months in private residential units.\n\nSince estate agency work includes introducing property owner or landlord to a tenant, assisting in the negotiation of a transaction between both parties, as well as subsequent work relating to the transaction, the operations of these managing agents raise the question of why they are not licensed by or regulated under the CEA since they provide some form of property leasing services.\n\nIn response to BT's query, the CEA said that under the Estate Agents Act, entities and individuals conducting estate agency work in Singapore must be licensed and registered with the CEA.\n\nBut entities managing serviced apartments, which are intended for short-term stays in a way similar to hotels, need not be licensed under the Estate Agents Act, said Ms Chua. \"The key issue is that serviced apartments must have the requisite planning approval from URA to be used as such.\"\n\nAtas Residence was managing short-term stays for entire developments Oxley Thanksgiving Residence, St Thomas Lodge and Devonshire Apartments near Somerset - projects that did not have planning permission to be run as serviced apartments as at April 9, the date when the BT articles were published.\n\nSince then, Atas Residence has moved St Thomas Lodge and Devonshire Apartments - two strata-titled developments - to its long-term stay catalogue but kept Oxley Thanksgiving Residence under the short-term stay category.\n\nBT understands that URA on Wednesday granted written permission for the proposed change of use of Oxley Thanksgiving Residence - a single strata development owned by Chinese temple Poh Ern Shih - to serviced apartments this week. The five-storey block at 328 River Valley Road has a total of 88 units with two levels of basement carparks, swimming pool and a roof terrace.\n\nThe Chinese temple had submitted a formal application on April 14 to URA for the conversion of use to serviced apartments.\n\nUnder URA's guidelines for serviced apartments, they have to be non-strata subdivided, self-contained apartments with provision for kitchenettes or kitchens and have support services such as concierge, housekeeping and/or laundry provided for the residents. They are rented out for lodging for a minimum of seven days or other longer periods.\n\nLocations where serviced apartment use can be considered for approval are sites fronting major and arterial roads within predominantly residential areas, or sites located in mixed use areas, such as commercial centres and business parks; or abutting medical hubs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Recall that the group incurred capex of S$905 million in FY15 and S$772 million in FY14, mostly due to the new yards in Singapore and Brazil. Given such, the group's net gearing only inched up slightly from 1.0x in Q4 2015 to 1.1x in Q1 2016. Meanwhile, there were net operating cash outflows of S$72.9 million in Q1 2016, mostly due to working capital needs.\n\nIt expects its working capital needs to be lower this year, and that the deliveries of the Hercules jack-up, Noble CJ70 jack-up, offshore platform for Ivar Aasen, as well as the Libra FPSO project to result in cash inflow of S$1.5-2.0 billion by the end of the year.

Ilham's public art gallery is driven by veteran gallerist Valentine Willie, backed by former Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin and housed in the Norman Foster-designed 275-metre-tall Ilham Tower.\n\nLove Me in My Batik is only the gallery's second exhibition after it opened last August, and showcases modern batik art from the 1960s and beyond.\n\nPioneered by Penang artist Chuah Thean Teng in the 1950s, it is a modern art form that's unique to Malaysia even though the craft of batik itself is more synonymous with Indonesia today.\n\n\"It came about at a time when Malaya as a young nation was trying to engineer a sense of common Malayan culture and identity,\" says Rahel Joseph, Ilham's gallery director.\n\nThe exhibition focuses on how Chuah and other artists painted in batik style on cloth, as defined by the dye-resist method rather than by batik motifs. \"It was embraced by the country's new government because here was a Chinese artist who used Western techniques on a traditional Malay medium, so it symbolised the new Malaya,\" Ms Joseph points out.\n\nThe artform's popularity waned in the 1980s, but the exhibition does show how two contemporary artists, Yee I-Lann and Liew Kung Yu, have used it in their artmaking.\n\nThe use of batik in contemporary art also didn't take off in Indonesia, but there are some works by acclaimed Indonesian artist Eko Negroho and Bali-based Singapore artist Samantha Mintio in the small selection of Indonesian contemporary art to provide a point of comparison.\n\nOver at Galeri Petronas, Kuala Lumpur's foremost public gallery for contemporary art, a group show of 40 Young Malaysian Artists (YMA) defying the conventional and predictable idea of art is an enlightening survey of how the young generation responds to the constant change in trends and ideas.\n\nAmong the highlights of YMA: New Object(ion) III are Mohd Faizal Suhif's Potret Diri (Self Portrait), an installation of print and soil; Nur Hasyimah Ramli's Freedom installation where she's cleverly used cylindrical anamorphic art to portray breakdancing in a kinetic way; and Anniketyni Madian's My Adidas, which is a carving of the Adidas logo with the use of Dayak handwoven ikat cloth style.\n\nOthers include Yau Sir Meng's Education - Melting, which shows a sugar cube construct of a school, and a video of the school melting in the rain; while Lee Mok Yee has used Chinese praying wooden divination sticks to form a \"Malaysia map\" to represent his point of view on the country's politics.\n\nThe works in these galleries give a good sample of Malaysian contemporary art that's in the public eye and although not always as pointed in terms of political commentary, current events are still captured in the artists' works. Just take a closer look at Chang Fee Ming's Just Another Year, hanging at the Bank Negara Museum, for example, and you might see the gist of Malaysia's financial woes.\n\nLove Me in My Batik: Modern Batik Art from Malaysia and Beyond is on until June 15 at Ilham Gallery, 8 Jalan Binjai, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nwww.ilhamgallery.com\n\nYMA: New Object(ions) III will show at Galeri Petronas, KLCC, until May 22.\n\nwww.galeripetronas.com.my\n\nIn Singapore, One East Asia and Larasati Auctioneers will hold an exhibition of Chang Fee Ming's paintings and sketches from his travels throughout South-east Asia from\n\nMay 9-31 at the gallery's space (#09-03, Thong Teck Building, Scotts Road). The works originate from a single private collection and a book, A Traveller's Diary, will be launched at the opening on May 9.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

S'pore goes it her own way.\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 28, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nFollow\n\nTHE British newspaper, The Guardian, recently ran an article on Singapore in its \"The story of cities\" section. The article acknowledged the extraordinary growth of Singapore's gross national product per capita, the jump in its external trade, the increase in life expectancy and its success with public housing.\n\nBut then there is the obligatory indictment of Singapore for being a flawed democracy. \"The degree of state power that has enabled such extensive and rapidly executed feats of urban planning has also led to policies that appear to the rest of the world as draconian,\" the article intoned.\n\nNot really. Singapore's policies do not appear draconian to \"the rest of the world\". They might annoy or enrage liberal opinion in the West and its intellectual suburbs, but that is not \"the rest of the world\". The rest of the world does not have a uniform opinion of Singapore.\n\nInstead, there is a clear disconnect between the monochromatic lenses generally used by Western commentators and the nuanced view taken by observers in the developing world.\n\nIn Zimbabwe and South Africa, which I visited recently, there is a palpable sense of people looking to Singapore as a model for developing countries. Members of the political and business elite in these two countries and from other African states enquired about the particular mix of good governance, fiscal prudence, social discipline and political authoritarianism that has produced contemporary Singapore.\n\nAdmittedly, few were enthusiastic about authoritarianism per se. For a continent that has had more than its fair share of despots and dictators, particularly military strongmen, democracy is a tangible good. In South Africa, where the movement for democracy was an intrinsic part of the struggle against apartheid, democracy means nothing less than freedom - and \"freedom\" is a beautiful word.\n\nHowever, even in African countries, citizens are aware of the need for trade-offs between personal liberty and the collective good. These compromises cannot be made by a leader - no matter how great he or she is - permanently on the behalf of citizens. They have to be made by a parliament or some other representative system that is accountable to the wishes of the people.\n\nHence my African friends were curious about how Singapore's democracy has evolved with its economics. What kind of system do Singaporeans want? What do the young in particular think? Is Singapore moving towards gender equality? How are the minorities faring politically and economically? How is life for the poor? Does social equity feature prominently on the national agenda? Does Singapore have inclusive growth?\n\nThese are questions that have empirical answers. Undoubtedly, any answer can be contested, but there are at least real parameters and yardsticks that can be used.\n\nThe questions are very different in the essentialist agenda pursued by Western liberals. Their fundamental, teleological and arrogant assumption is that there is but a single historical trajectory for all nations - the one created by Western experience and practice, and that countries should be judged by where they stand on that trajectory.\n\nThe truth is that there is no such trajectory. There are different historical and cultural trajectories that globalisation is bringing together. These are jostling for global space; they are making competing claims on the future. No one ideology has a monopoly on that future.\n\nA recent indication of Singapore's refusal to go along with the shifting currents of liberal opinion was the no-nonsense style in which Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam told the United Nations that the city-state would not soften its drug policies. He said: \"I am prepared to compare our experiences with any city that you choose. Show us a model that works better, that delivers a better outcome for citizens, and we will consider changing. If that cannot be done, then don't ask us to change.\"\n\nThis ability to stick to what works for Singapore is a hallmark that others respect. Reflective Malaysians and Indonesians, for example, pay Singapore grudging but genuine respect for having achieved a quality of life that attracts many in Asean and elsewhere.\n\nSingaporeans would shortchange themselves if they took for granted the peace and order that they enjoy. It is ordinary humans who suffer when those in power put their private interests ahead of the national good, leading to civil war or outright invasion.\n\nGoing beyond bottomline issues such as drugs and murder and touching on political and social structures, others might see Singapore as a model, but thoughtful Singaporeans do not. They know only that a certain policy and cultural mix has worked for their country. It might be irrelevant elsewhere. If anything, the so-called Singapore model is a sui generis one - of its own kind.\n\nThe problem is that while Singapore does not impose its way of life on others, others incessantly seek to do so for it. This is seen clearly in the way the functioning of its media is viewed by their Western counterparts and observers.\n\nThis year's World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders, places Singapore's media in the 154th position on a list of 180 countries. Finland tops the list; Eritrea comes in last. According to the Paris-based non-governmental organisation, the index, unveiled earlier this month, \"reflects the intensity of the attacks on journalistic freedom and independence by governments, ideologies and private-sector interests during the past year\".\n\nWhat go missing in such surveys are the rigorous standards of credibility by which Singaporean readers judge their media. \"Independence\" is not credibility, because there are many independent news sources and platforms around the world which are not trusted.\n\nThe Singapore media - no matter how they are rated by Western or West-oriented organisations - follow stringent rules of factuality and balance. Day after day, they also own up to mistakes instead of trying to brush them under the carpet. Of course, those who are hostile to the way in which Singapore as a whole functions cannot possibly like the way its media operates. However, it is quite possible to disagree with parts of the Singapore system and yet appreciate the professional effort that goes into producing quality newspapers.\n\nAll in all, the attention that Singapore receives, whether in the West or elsewhere, reflects the premises of those societies as much as Singapore's specific realities.\n\nThis is a fact of life that Singapore has to live with.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Shares fell as much as 9 per cent in Tokyo trading.\n\nNintendo, known for popularising consoles more than three decades ago, is starting to embrace the age of mobile gaming. So far, the signs are encouraging: Miitomo, a new free-to-play messaging app, has attracted more than 10 million users since its debut last month. Still, the company hasn't committed the most popular characters from its Mario or Zelda franchises to the smartphone effort, and its new NX gaming device won't debut until 2017. This means that there won't be a new product for this year's holiday shopping season, and that has people worried.\n\n\"Investors are not going to like that,\" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. \"With the titles coming later in the year, earnings for the first half don't look so good. And people who expected NX to launch this year will also be disappointed.\"\n\nSeparately, Nintendo said it's planning to sell its majority stake in the Seattle Mariners baseball team and a regional sports network to the team's other owners, including mobile-phone mogul John Stanton. The deal may value the entire business at US$1.4 billion. Nintendo said it plans to keep a 10 per cent stake.\n\nNet income will probably climb to 35 billion yen (S$435 million) on revenue of 500 billion yen in the year ending March 2017, the Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a statement on Wednesday. While that's more than double the previous period, the forecast is below analysts' projection for 44.1 billion yen, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNintendo predicted that Wii U sales will fall to 800,000 units from 3.26 million, while those of 3DS will decline to 5 million from 6.79 million. The company said NX will launch in March 2017 and didn't give a unit forecast.\n\nPresident Tatsumi Kimishima said the two new smartphone titles will help bolster profit when they launch in the Japanese fall season. The company didn't disclose how much mobile games will contribute to profit this fiscal year.\n\n\"These two smartphone games will appeal to different user demographics,\" he said at a briefing in Osaka. \"We chose two different genres to appeal to as many Nintendo fans as possible.\"\n\nAnimal Crossing is a community simulation game series where players earn currency by trading and mastering skills such as fishing. The franchise sold more than 20 million units on the 3DS and its predecessor, according to Nintendo. Fire Emblem is a role-playing game, also available on the handheld.\n\nNintendo shares jumped 33 per cent in 2015 after the company said it planned to develop titles for iPhones and other mobile devices. Miitomo lets users automatically generate a cartoon-like avatar using a photo taken on the smartphone, and tweak minute facial features, set personality parameters and choose the character's voice.\n\nNintendo teamed with DeNA Co, operator of the Mobage network, to create mobile games and operate new membership services that will eventually - though not immediately - include applications based on Nintendo's character line-up of plumbers, gorillas and princesses. The company has said it plans to release five smartphone titles by March 2017.\n\n\"If Mario is available on smartphones, then why buy into the closed world of Nintendo handheld gaming?\" said Pelham Smithers, whose London-based firm offers equity research on Asian technology companies. \"Nintendo is going to delay releasing a Mario smartphone game until proven that it's the only way to monetise its key intellectual properties on mobile.\"\n\nMr Kimishima declined to give details on the NX device, saying only that it shouldn't be considered a replacement for the Wii U or 3DS. Still, the company may end production of Wii U hardware in the year to March 2018, to focus on NX output, he said.

Near 1700 GMT, the dollar was at 108.13 yen from 111.47 yen Wednesday.\n\nThe move by the Japanese central bank suggests \"the BOJ itself may be confused about what the right next step should be,\" said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.\n\n\"That's not a good position and it is apt to make life more difficult for other central banks as they contemplate their next moves and how to avoid counter-productive decision making.\" Traders had widely expected the BoJ to unveil fresh measures to shore up the world's number three economy after this month's deadly earthquakes in southern Japan and a string of weak data.\n\n\"It's a total shock,\" said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors.\n\n\"From currencies to equities to everything - you can see the reaction in the markets. I can't believe this. It's very disappointing.\" The drag from the BoJ move was partly countered by merger news.\n\nDreamWorks Animation, the studio known for its Shrek and Madagascar films, surged 24.1 per cent as it agreed to be acquired by Comcast for $3.8 billion. Comcast fell 0.2 per cent Medical device maker St. Jude Medical soared 25.6 percent on news it reached a deal to be acquired by Abbott for US$25 billion in cash and shares. Abbott lost 7.8 per cent.\n\nA second big healthcare deal also looked possible as drugmaker Sanofi went public with a an all-cash US$9.3 billion offer for Medivation, saying the US company repeatedly refused to engage in talks.\n\nMedivation climbed 7.9 per cent, while US shares of Sanofi lost 1.8 per cent.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Capital Markets & Currencies\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust\u2019s proposed privatisation by sponsor gets SGX in-principle approval\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 AM\n\nStocks to watch: OCBC, SGX, Centurion, Sats, Frasers Property, Frasers Hospitality Trust\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:39 AM\n\nAims Financial Group raises stake in Aims Apac Reit to 18.7%\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:35 AM\n\nUS dollar has best week since February on tariff inflation risks\n\nJul 12, 2025 11:52 AM\n\nEurope: Stocks down with bank and healthcare drag, US-EU tariffs in focus\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:56 AM\n\nUS: Stocks edge down from records amid tariff threats\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:45 AM\n\nSingapore stocks notch 5-day rally ahead of GDP data\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:06 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM", "images": []}

And I, as a leader, was too aggressive.\"\n\n\"While raising the prices of these drugs increased the profits of Valeant, it destroyed enormous shareholder value,\" said Bill Ackman, who sits on the company's board and whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP was one of its biggest holders.\n\nThe stock's plunge - down 87 per cent since its August 2015 peak - has cost Mr Ackman's fund billions, and cost Mr Pearson his job. In a half-empty hearing room in Washington on Wednesday, it became apparent that it has also forced a major reassessment of Valeant's strategy of sharp price increases, often on older medicines that the company acquired through deals.\n\n\"By all accounts, Valeant is the company that perfected the strategy of strategic acquisitions and price hikes that made it Wall Street's dream come true,\" said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee.\n\nAt the hearing, Ms McCaskill and her Republican counterpart, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, honed in on four drugs. Isuprel and Nitropress are heart treatments that Valeant acquired and then quickly raised their prices by 525 per cent and 212 per cent respectively. Two others, Syprine and Cuprimine, are used to treat a genetic disorder called Wilson's disease. Valeant raised Cuprimine's price for 100 capsules to US$26,189 from US$888, and Syprine's increased by more than 30-fold, Ms Collins said.\n\nAsked if there was any drug that the company sold in the US that Valeant hadn't raised the price on after acquiring it through a deal, Mr Pearson said he couldn't name any.\n\nValeant's stock fell 3.6 per cent to US$34.92 at the close in New York. Valeant is also planning to shake up its board, replacing five directors, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. One of those likely departing is Mason Morfit, president at ValueAct Capital Management LLC, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The person asked not to be identified because the matter is private. One of the seats will be taken by Joe Papa, former CEO of Perrigo Co, who will become CEO and chairman of Valeant, replacing Mr Pearson.\n\nThe drugmaker's tactics eventually brought the focus of health insurers and politicians who pushed back on covering products and hauled it up to Capitol Hill for hearings.\n\nOne patient, Berna Heyman, told the committee that she suffers from Wilson's disease and used to take Syprine. The disorder, sometimes fatal, causes copper to accumulate in the brain, liver and other organs. After Valeant acquired the drug, her co-payments for it went from less than US$700 a year to more than US$10,000.\n\nShe wrote to Valeant about the cost, she said, and the company told her it needed to charge that much to make investments in its drugs. After a story about her appeared in the Financial Times, she said the company telephoned and offered to help. She refused, she said, not wanting special treatment others didn't get. Then a florist called, saying that Valeant had sent her flowers.\n\n\"I refused the flowers and asked that the sender be informed of my refusal,\" Ms Heyman told the committee.

At Tamashii Robataya, you can get a sake steamboat instead.\n\nChef/owner Patrick Tan recently introduced Sake Shabu Shabu on his menu. What you get is about 1.2 litres of dry sake cooked in a pot with some clams for added sweetness.\n\nThe sake is warmed up to about 80 degress C before the meat is added in. For two persons, you get 400g of Kurobuta pork belly and pork loin. The thinly sliced pork is lightly cooked shabu shabu style. The sweetness of the sake is evident especially in the pork loin. The meat is tasty enough to eat on its own, or it can be dipped into the ponzu sauce.\n\nAfter the meat is cooked, the vegetables are added, and these are dipped in a sesame sauce. At the end of the meal, a bowl of Japanese rice is added to the sake, and slowly cooked until it becomes risotto-like.\n\nBy this time, most of the alcohol would have evaporated, but the porridge is intensely flavoured by the sake; a comforting way to end the meal.\n\nThe set meal also comes with two appetisers and dessert. Additional items are also available, such as wagyu or Japanese crab at an extra charge.\n\nBy Tay Suan Chiang\n\nDINING\n\nSen of Japan's new menu and Chef's Table menu\n\nCATCH Sen of Japan's executive chef Nakano Hiromi in action over the next two weeks, as he steps into the kitchen of his casual modern Japanese restaurant at Marina Bay Sands.

This lifted net profit for the full year ended March 31 by 20.1 per cent to S$109.3 million, even as rail operations dragged on group earnings.\n\nRevenue for the three months rose 2.8 per cent to S$320 million while other operating income increased 18.3 per cent to S$22.8 million. For the full year, revenue climbed 4.9 per cent to S$1.3 billion while other operating income gained 33.4 per cent at S$77.3 million.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the full year were 7.17 Singapore cents, up from 5.98 Singapore cents in FY2015. EPS for the quarter was 1.74 Singapore cents, up from 1.37 Singapore cents in Q4 FY2015.\n\nThe board has proposed a final dividend per ordinary share (DPS) of 2.50 cents, up from 1.75 Singapore cents last year.\n\nRail revenue for the year rose 4.1 per cent to S$681 million. Full-year operating profit from rail was S$7.4 million, down 22.5 per cent. The operating profit for FY2016 included a net property tax refund of S$17.1 million relating to prior year's over-assessment, said SMRT. Without this boost, rail operations would have suffered an operating loss of S$9.6 million.\n\nHigher staff costs, and repairs and maintenance-related expenditure affected rail profits, said SMRT. \"As fare adjustments have not kept pace with rising operating costs over the years, the current rail operating landscape continues to be challenging,\" it said.\n\nThere is still no light at the end of the tunnel in the coming months for rail profits. \"The group is expected to incur higher operating expenses attributable to the intensive maintenance and renewal programmes of the ageing network,\" said SMRT.\n\nIt also noted that with an enlarged train fleet, and with the Tuas West Extension starting operations in FY17, operating expenses will rise further.\n\nOverall operating profit from the group's non-rail business increased 22.6 per cent to S$133.3 million in FY2016, due largely to improved profitability in the bus, rental and taxi segments. Among them, operating profit from taxi operations increased 24 per cent to S$17 million for the full year, as taxi rental contribution rose due to a newer and larger hired-out fleet.\n\nProfits from buses swung back into the black for FY16, hitting S$5.9 million from a loss of S$6.5 million last year. This was due to grants and incentives it received, with lower diesel costs and higher revenue that lifted earnings, said SMRT.\n\nSMRT shares closed trading on Thursday at S$1.48, down 0.5 cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Pick a country bent on being competitive", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFancy starting a business? Pick a country bent on being competitive\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 28, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nBRICS\n\nFollow\n\nIMAGINE that you could open a business anywhere in the world. Where would you choose? Before you decide, consider these facts: The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) have not lived up to their potential - the Shanghai stock market alone has lost 30 per cent of its value since June 2015.\n\nMost of the world's 36 advanced economies grew less last year than they did in 2007, with the exception being the United States, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Currently, around 25 per cent of all government bonds outstanding in the world have negative interest rates. And, at the same time, central banks everywhere are manipulating currency markets, which is unsustainable in the long term. So where, then, should wise entrepreneurs set up shop? The answer is in competitive economies.\n\nWhether or not a country is competitive is not determined by short-term growth, countries' own assessment of prosperity or even competition. Rather, it is about the ability to generate sustainable long-term value. From an entrepreneur's point of view, another key factor identified by the IMD World Competitiveness Center (WCC) is that a country that improves its competitiveness will see a subsequent improvement in gross domestic product and stockmarket growth. This indicates that competitiveness is a key economic driver in a way that simple economic growth is not; past economic growth does not automatically lead to future stockmarket returns.\n\nCompetitiveness at the country level is about managing resources and competencies - the value drivers - to create an environment in which companies can maintain sustainable value creation. Doing this effectively requires the country to have the right value drivers in its economy and to manage them, as opposed to managing key performance indicators.\n\nFor example, Mexico is focusing on value drivers to increase its competitiveness by improving its healthcare and educational systems and reducing its public sector; Chile's massive educational reform aimed at ensuring everyone has access to education means the country has fewer resources to develop its infrastructure, but education is an important tool to reduce income inequality, and therefore a driver of competitiveness.\n\nThe IMD WCC's typical competitiveness model starts with the government. Good government entails good regulation, transparency (no corruption) and a focus on people. Although jobs are created by the private sector, governments need to develop a favourable environment for companies to be able to generate jobs. Singapore and the UAE are good examples of government models that have fostered such an environment.\n\nCountries that fail to provide this are less likely to attract business investments. Many developing countries, including most of the BRICS, have poor infrastructure (among other things), which prevents many organisations from running their business there. Good regulation and infrastructure are essential elements for business creation.\n\nCountry competitiveness also requires development of the private sector to boost business and job creation. In this context, good regulation, such as that seen in Switzerland, is essential to promote entrepreneurship and allow companies to attract capital.\n\nPOLITICAL LEADERS WITH VISION\n\nAnother important characteristic of competitive countries is leadership. One promising example of this can be seen in Mongolia, which recently discovered the largest copper reserves in the world - an amazing find for such a poor country. When the news was revealed, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the country's president, said that it was extremely important to ensure that the wealth generated helped the population of this historically poor country to improve their lives. This is a leader with a vision.\n\nA clear strategy is also an important aspect of competitive countries. Think about the strategies countries have been implementing to emerge from the crisis in Europe. Spain is working its way out of the crisis, but what exactly is its economic strategy? It is frequently difficult to explain a country's economic policy, but one example of a country that has a clear strategy is Mexico. Its president, Enrique Pena Nieto, said: \"Mexico urgently needs a series of structural reforms that will generate more public welfare.\"\n\nStrategy should not only provide answers to short-term problems but also focus on long-term issues, since one of the main drivers of competitiveness is a long-term orientation. However, the difficulty here is that most political systems hamper long-term vision because leaders tend to focus on quick wins in an effort to win the next election.\n\nEach country should develop a framework and strategy that is relevant to its own specific context. Learning from good practice is one thing but copying another country's competitiveness model is not a good idea because no two countries have the same context. As Stephane Garelli, former director of the IMD WCC, said: \"It doesn't matter which country you go to, the salad is going to be different. It doesn't mean it is going to be better; it is just going to be different.\"\n\nFinally, countries should focus on institutional reform rather than economic growth, since institutions - that is, an organisation of people who share a clear goal - are a key driver of competitiveness.\n\nSo, back to our original question: Where should you set up your new business? Our research suggests that you should choose a country that is determined to be competitive. Look for one with leadership; a long-term view; a clear, focused, and unique strategy; and development that supports both private enterprise and institutions.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

But when asked, Olivia Newton-John remains modest about her longevity.\n\nThe Cambridge-born singer and actress says, in an email interview: \"I'm just thankful I'm still singing and people are still turning up to see me! Even though I've been doing this for over 50 years, I'm having even more fun than when I was younger. I think one of the main things that kept me here so long is that I've been blessed to have wonderful songs by amazing songwriters and producers.\"\n\nThough Newton-John has had success with movies like Xanadu and songs like Physical, it was the role of Sandy Olsson in Grease that really elevated her career. She says: \"I'm so happy that this film brings so much joy to so many people for so many years. I was nervous about doing it because I had done a film that wasn't very good early in my career and I didn't want to jinx my recording career which was doing well.\"\n\nBut after a screen test with John Travolta, she was all in, \"though I don't think any of us expected it to become the classic it is\".\n\nHer Summer Nights tour, named after one of the musical's best known songs, will come to Singapore for one night only next week. The 67-year-old says: \"The show's a musical journey through my life and career so you can expect early country hits like Let Me Be There, songs from Grease and Xanadu, as well as some surprises and songs that were big influences in my career.\"\n\nWhile Newton-John loves both acting and singing, she's very passionate about performing live, with singing at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics being one of her favourite moments of her career. She says: \"Performing live gives you something different every night, and the energy you get from the audience can be very energising. It also gives me a chance to interact with my fans.\"\n\nWhen she's not performing, Newton-John spends her time with her husband, daughter, and pets. And after surviving breast cancer in 1992, she also set up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, her hometown.\n\nThe mother of one has no regrets because \"it's not healthy\" but does look back at a missed opportunity. \"I almost toured with Frank Sinatra, but I'd just given birth to my daughter, Chloe, and she was a baby. I wanted to be at home with her, but had the timing been different, that would have been a great experience.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Duty-free shops at Changi Airport have run out of stock, but if you're lucky, you might find a handful of blends. And the few retail stores here that have them are charging an arm and a kidney for it.\n\nThis can all be traced to November 2014, when influential British whisky writer Jim Murray dubbed Suntory's Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2013 single malt \"World Whisky of the Year\" in the 2015 edition of his Whisky Bible. It was awarded 97.5 points out of 100 - a first for a Japanese whisky.\n\nYamazaki Sherry Cask 2013 stock everywhere evaporated - which was unsurprising since only 18,000 bottles were made. But every other Yamazaki whisky also got snapped up. And then any Japanese single malt became inexplicably associated with what Murray called the \"near indescribable genius\" of Sherry Cask 2013.\n\nThis year, this legendary whisky that single-handedly elevated Japanese single malts has gained a successor. Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016 was released globally in February.\n\nSuntory chief blender Shinji Fukuyo used the same lot of whiskies for Sherry Cask 2016 that produced the 2013 edition, except they had an additional two years to mature. Some of these whiskies are more than 25 years old and, as the whisky's name suggests, all of them have been aged only in Spanish oak casks that previously held Oloroso Sherry.\n\nThe result is dark brown liquid, a nose of raisins and dark chocolate, spices and restrained sweetness in the mouth, and an incredibly long finish that keeps evolving and refuses to fade.\n\nIts exquisite taste makes this a must-try - that is, if you can get your hands on it. That's the tricky bit, because only 5,000 bottles are available internationally.\n\nSo, what we have here is a whisky with production roughly a quarter that of the Sherry Cask 2013, released into a market amid hype and pent-up demand.\n\nThat's why even though Quaich Bar at Waterfront Plaza has just managed to acquire two bottles of Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016 (each costs S$2,800), it may have already been sold by the time you read this. Quaich Bar also has a bottle of Sherry Cask 2013, for the curious and deep-pocketed - priced at a cool S$4,000.\n\nDon't blame Beam Suntory for the mark-up; the recommended US retail price was only US$300.\n\nIf you must try some, the Auld Alliance at Rendezvous Hotel is currently offering the 2011 and 2012 editions of the Yamazaki Sherry Cask by the glass, at S$50 (half) or S$100 (full). And when those are finished, there is a bottle of Sherry Cask 2016 waiting to be opened, which will likely be priced at S$65 for half a glass or S$130 for a full glass.\n\nThat lowers the entry price for enthusiasts, but will frustrate collectors and investors. Auld Alliance co-owner Emmanuel Dron steadfastly refuses to sell his Yamazaki Sherry Cask stock by the bottle despite repeated offers. He wants as many whisky lovers as possible to try it.\n\nThe good news is Suntory will continue to produce its classic range of whiskies that state a specific age: Yamazaki 12 Years Old, 18 Years Old, and 25 Years Old.

We might all know why Sang Nila Utama named it the Lion City, or how it started off as just a modest shipping port, but what about the little things that weren't in our school history text books?\n\nDid you know, for example, that the front lawn of the National Museum of Singapore used to play host to a row of street vendors peddling hawker fare in the 1960s? Have you ever been inside a Chinese clan association on Bukit Pasoh Road?\n\nIn its 13th edition this year, the Singapore HeritageFest is back and bigger than ever, and it promises to let you see a side of Singapore you haven't before.\n\nWong Hong Suen, senior assistant director at the National Heritage Board, says: \"Through HeritageFest, We want Singaporeans to be able to reconnect to our past while also building new memories of the place we call home.\"\n\nThe festival will take place over three weekends this year instead of the usual five \"to keep the momentum and excitement strong\" and will incorporate more than 130 programmes this year. Because the length of HeritageFest has been cut short, organisers expect a turnout of 1.55 million people, down from last year's figure of 1.6 million.\n\nBut Ms Wong believes the steady growth of community partners, around 120 this year, is a better indicator of how well the festival is received. She says: \"We had about 80 partners last year, so it's a 50 per cent increase. There's nothing more representative in terms of growth and success than the desire of the community to be a part of the programme.\"\n\nTo better accommodate these community partners, as with the past edition, HeritageFest has done away with a general theme, choosing instead to retain the essence of what it's all about. Namely, the concept of local heritage.\n\nMs Wong says: \"We don't want to turn away people because their ideas don't fit in with a theme. We're a festival for the people by the people, so it's all about finding ways to be more inclusive so everyone can contribute in a fashion they're comfortable with. It's really this dynamism that keeps us alive and unique.\"\n\nThe opening programme will be A Taste of Heritage, where second-, third-, and even fourth-generation hawkers will line the front lawn of the National Museum offering local dishes like Indian rojak, wanton noodles and satay.\n\n\"Food is an integral part of our Singaporean identity and nothing gets us talking more animatedly and around-the-clock quite like it,\" she says. \"So we'll kick things off with young 'hawkerpreneurs' who'll share not just their cooking, but also their family recipes with the public.\"\n\nKeeping true to the festival's stance on inclusion, the 130 programmes will run the whole gamut from arts to nature, so there's something on offer for everyone. Another highlight from the first weekend will be the closure of Bukit Pasoh Road, where activities and performances will take to the street for the first time.\n\nMs Wong shares: \"The Bukit Pasoh precinct is so rich in history and its row of conserved shophouses is of great interest to people. What's really exciting is that more than 10 Chinese clans including the Ee Hoe Hean Club and Gan Clan Singapore will be opening up their spaces and offering calligraphy and opera workshops to the public.\"\n\nAnother new programme will be held at the former Command House on the second weekend. Along with a classical music performance, festival-goers can enjoy guided tours of the very centre which served as the headquarters for the British-Malayan Army during World War II.\n\nOn the finale weekend, HeritageFest will take to Pulau Ubin, or \"what people may know as Singapore's last-living kampong\", for the first time, where members of the public can indulge in musical performances, trail walks, and a specially commissioned film screening, where local director Royston Tan will be premiering his newest film Homecoming.\n\nMs Wong says: \"As early as 1951, there used to be a community centre at Pulau Ubin where people would have regular get-togethers. We chose the venue of the film screening to be a former basketball court where residents would watch television in a communal fashion. Since that closed, we wanted to give back to the community and bring back something that was lost to those still living on the island.\"\n\nAnd don't expect the festival to stop growing anytime soon. She says: \"HeritageFest is a platform for community collaboration so it's about looking for fresh ways to include people from all walks of life to celebrate our shared memories. Going forward, you can certainly expect a larger variety of programmes, and we look forward to uncovering many more national stories from our rich past.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With markets still unstable due to uncertainty over emerging market economies, such positive changes will take a while to appear.\n\n\"That is why we have decided to scrutinise the effect of our policy steps for the time being. Having said that, strong risks exist on the outlook for the economy and prices. We will scrutinise risks to the economy and prices and won't hesitate taking additional monetary easing steps.\"\n\nThe BOJ's inaction was also seen to have been influenced by the relative inaction of the US Federal Reserve. After a two-day policy meeting this week, the Fed said global economic headwinds remained on its radar, indicating a possibly cautious attitude toward further interest rate hikes in the near future.\n\nAnother factor thought to have played a part in the BOJ taking a wait-and-see attitude is the upcoming Group of Seven (G7) summit meeting, which Japan is hosting next month. The meeting, which could come out in favour of stepped-up fiscal stimulus in advanced economies, will take place before the BOJ's next meeting.\n\nA new emphasis on fiscal stimulus could relieve some of the pressure that has built up around monetary policy to restore growth - in Japan and the euro area especially - and also relieve central banks of the need to adhere to inflation targets that appear to be receding ever into the future.\n\nVeteran Japan analyst Jesper Koll told The Business Times on Thursday: \"Today's decision is more conservative than many market participants had wished for, but it runs in line with our thinking that the next move will come coordinated with (Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's) new fiscal spending initiative, due around May 20 to 25.\"\n\nMr Koll, the chief executive officer at investment group Wisdom Tree Japan, added: \"We expect a supplementary Budget of around 10 trillion yen (S$124.1 billion) and expect that the BOJ will basically finance it by raising its bond-buying targets.\"\n\nThe BOJ has already been forced to delay the timing of its inflation target or \"price goal\" several times since 2013; Thursday's decision pushes it further back from the latter half of fiscal 2016 to some time in fiscal 2017. Rising oil prices are not expected to push up prices until then.\n\nIn downwardly revised projections for inflation, the Policy Board said that consumer prices will remain flat in fiscal 2015; they may rise by up to 0.8 per cent in fiscal 2016 and by between 0.8 per cent and 2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (excluding the impact of a sales tax hike due to be implemented that year).\n\nThe Board also revised down its forecast for Japan's real gross domestic product growth to 0.7 per cent in fiscal 2015. The earlier forecast was between 1 and 1.3 per cent. Projections for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 have also been tamped down.\n\nThe sluggish wage growth in Japan is one factor behind the downward revisions.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bad loans stayed concentrated in the oil-related segment.\n\nThe smallest of the trio, UOB said net profit stood at S$766 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, down from S$801 million in the same period a year ago. This was largely in line with analysts' expectations. A Bloomberg poll of five analysts showed up a S$767 million average forecast; a similar survey of five analysts by Reuters yielded a forecast of S$764 million.\n\nAnnualised earnings per share came to S$1.84, against S$1.93 a year ago. Shares of UOB lost three cents to end at S$18.85 on Thursday.\n\nGains from stronger interest margins were mostly offset by weaker performance in wealth management, as well as trading and investment, reflecting volatility that gripped markets in most of the first three months.\n\nNet interest income rose 6.1 per cent to S$1.28 billion, driven by improved net interest margin (NIM). The NIM was up by two basis points to 1.78 per cent.\n\nGross loans were also up.\n\nBut non-interest income fell 8 per cent to S$695 million in the first quarter from the same period a year ago.\n\nTotal income inched higher to S$1.97 billion. But this came up against creeping expenses, with higher staff costs, revenue and IT-related expenses pushing total expenses up by 4.9 per cent to S$894 million.\n\nTax expense also rose 19 per cent to S$158 million on lower write-back of prior years' tax provisions.\n\nSpecific allowances on loans more than doubled to S$133 million, with the largest allowances for credit risks out of Singapore, and Indonesia - reflecting ongoing pressure from lower oil prices. This is a portion of earnings set aside for specific loans that are under stress. It was also higher than a quarter ago. But this surge was more than offset by a writeback of general allowances on debts - an overall cushion against loans. With this, total allowances fell 30.7 per cent from a year ago to S$117 million.\n\nNon-performing loan (NPL) ratio rose to 1.4 per cent, from 1.2 per cent a year ago. It was unchanged from a quarter ago. The largest pool of NPLs remains captured under the transport, storage, and communication industry, which analysts have said would include offshore support firms.\n\n\"While revenue has moderated in line with the slower growth environment, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet, with stable asset quality and strong core capitalisation,\" said Wee Ee Cheong, UOB's chief executive officer, in a press statement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's the most recent stop in an around-the-world trip that began in Abu Dhabi last spring and is intended to raise awareness about the importance of reducing carbon emissions through the use of clean energy.\n\nThe plane itself, Solar Impulse 2, is a true zero-fuel aircraft, powered by more than 17,000 solar cells. It's designed to carry just one pilot - Mr Piccard and his colleague Andre Borschberg have been tag-teaming the journey around the world - and has the wingspan of a jumbo jet, although it weighs only two tonnes.\n\nThe daring trans-Pacific flight has drawn global interest to the concept of electric planes, which have existed in various forms for several decades now. Some designs rely on solar cells, while others use various types of batteries, but the overall goal is the same: to achieve flight with minimal or no fuel burning.\n\nElectric aircraft are among the more ambitious technologies being researched around the world in an effort to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. It's a cause that's rapidly gaining international attention.\n\nAviation is currently responsible for about one per cent of all the world's carbon emissions - and as air traffic is expected to experience rapid growth in the coming decades, that proportion could quickly climb if no steps are taken to improve the fuel efficiency of aircraft. Some estimates have suggested that by 2020, emissions from aviation could be 70 per cent higher than they were in 2005.\n\nTo that end, the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization proposed the world's first carbon dioxide emissions standards for aircraft back in February. And while some environmentalists have argued that the proposal did not go far enough, the action has placed aircraft emissions on the international radar - and scientists around the world are researching ways to reduce them.\n\nElectric flight, however, may be among the technologies that are furthest from becoming practical. So far, most of the electric planes that have achieved flight have been able to accommodate only one or two people, and it will likely be at least a decade or two before the technology will progress to the point that it's commercially viable.\n\n\"The big challenge is the batteries,\" said David Zingg, director of the University of Toronto's Institute for Aerospace Studies. For electric planes to become competitive, their power sources need to be able to store more energy per unit mass - otherwise, their speed and weight capacities will remain impractically low. \"You can imagine in 20 years you can have an aircraft the size of a 737 that's electric - but you can't be sure,\" he said. \"That all depends on battery technology.\"\n\nFor smaller aircraft, the technology may even be able to work its way into the market within the next 10 years, said Sean Clarke, co-principal investigator on a Nasa project called Sceptor, which is working on an experimental electric propulsion-powered aircraft. But in the meantime, there are plenty of other alternatives being explored that could start cutting emissions far sooner.\n\nIn March, United Airlines became the first American carrier to use renewable fuel for commercial operations when it began using biofuel in flights between Los Angeles and San Francisco. However, others may be following suit soon. Both Southwest Airlines and FedEx, for example, also have contracts with biofuel producers that will allow them to start buying renewable jet fuel for future use.\n\nThe basic idea behind renewable fuels is to use biological sources - usually plant or sometimes animal matter - instead of oil. Many biofuel companies have developed \"drop-in\" fuels that are designed to work safely in existing jet engines - usually requiring mixing with traditional fuels - making them an easy way to cut down on carbon emissions without requiring costly mechanical alterations.\n\nBut there are some cons to consider. When biofuels first started to become competitive, there was concern that they were competing with food growers for agricultural land - an issue that's become more salient as concern heightens over the planet's rapidly growing population and the future of global food security. As a result, producers are increasingly focusing on fuel sources that can be grown on land that's unsuitable for food crops.\n\nAdditionally, Mr Zingg pointed out, \"there's a ton of work to be done to make the processing efficient enough that it's cost efficient compared to fossil fuels\". Making physical design changes to planes is another way of increasing fuel efficiency. Finding ways to reduce the drag on aircraft in flight is one important research area, Mr Zingg said - for example, redesigning wings to improve the way air flows over the plane.\n\nNasa has focused a great deal of research on these types of design challenges in recent years. It's 2009-2015 Environmentally Responsible Aviation project focused on solutions that would cut down on noise, pollution and carbon output and included research on more efficient engines, lighter-weight aircraft materials and new body designs. At least one of the resulting technologies - a new, more aerodynamic design for aeroplane wing flaps - is already on its way to becoming commercialised, according to the agency.\n\nOther design research is ongoing. The Sceptor project, for example, which Mr Clarke is helping to lead, is working to design a smaller, more aerodynamic and efficient wing than would normally be possible by equipping it with electric motors to help energise the flow that generates lift on the plane.\n\nBut it's not necessarily all about the technology, Mr Zingg added. Even the way air traffic controllers guide planes can make a difference.

So VDP ought to \"do something\" to set itself apart.\n\nThere is a role for venture debt, he added. \"Almost all companies - e-commerce ones, in particular - need debt between formal equity rounds due to high capital costs of their business.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Lovely nose of purest pinot noir, midway in intensity between the Roumier and the Mugnier. And on the palate, also midway between the two, very fine, very fresh, and the best drinking of the three. Perhaps because it has had the most bottle-age.\n\nChambolle Musigny 1999 en magnum, Domaine Georges Roumier\n\nQuite deep red, with lightest tint of brown at edges. Lovely aroma, essence of pinot noir, perfectly ripe berries. Certainly the heaviest of the three on the palate, the densest in texture. In magnum too young?\n\nChambolle Musigny 2005 en magnum, Domaine J F Mugnier\n\nPale transparent light red with barest tinge of brown. Very fine delicate fruity aroma of perfectly ripe red berries. Light-footed imprint on palate, perfectly ripe fruit, transparent, weightless almost gossamer lightness, of palate. Long lingering finish.\n\nComte Georges de Vogue's Chambolle-Musigny Village was very characteristic of the Domaine's style, well-balanced, harmonious, true to their terroir. Mugnier's wine was more gossamer-like in texture, more transparent, well-balanced and long. Roumier's magnum from the great 1999 vintage looked as if it still needs more time as it appeared to be quite youthful.\n\nThese three wines epitomised the essence of Chambolle Musigny. As Burgundy lovers know, each Burgundy commune has its own character and profile, as does each appellation of Bordeaux. Gevrey-Chambertin in the north of Cote d'Or reminds me of Pauillac, its wines sturdy and powerful. Think Chambertin and think Ch\u00e2teau Latour. The essence of each is similar. Like most wine lovers starting to venture into Burgundy, Chambertin was my Burgundy benchmark, and Rousseau's Chambertins the Chambertin. Not easy to come by and not readily affordable too! Rousseau's Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru Clos St Jacques is a good and more affordable stand-in for Chambertin.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the vintages were different, these wines also reminded me vividly of that morning in June 2006 when my friend Georgia Tsouti of Domaine Michel Gros and I visited the three Domaines: De Vogue, Roumier and Mugnier in that order. At each Domaine we tasted cask-samples of their 2005 vintage wines, and at each Domaine the tasting ended with the Domaine's Musigny. It was, to say the least, a fascinating and illuminating tasting - the three most highly-regarded Domaines of Chambolle Musigny and cask samples of the great 2005 vintage.\n\nAnd as we sat happily savouring the experience over coffee in a neighbouring caf\u00e9, slowly recovering our breath, we compared notes and agreed that clearly Mugnier's wines, in particular his Musigny, were the best of the three.\n\nRegarding the characteristics of the wines of all the communes of Burgundy, Vosne-Romanee wines are perhaps the easiest to appreciate on first acquaintance - lush, rounded, and fruity. Seductive. Think Romanee-Conti, the Everest of Burgundy. Out of reach of wine-writers! Romanee-St-Vivant is a step lower in ranking and affordability. Vosne-Romanee is the most popular of all Burgundy communes. Morey-Saint-Denis wines are less heavy, more medium in weight and density, very characteristic pinot noir from Burgundy. Gevrey-Chambertin wines are heavier, firmer and less readily approachable. Nuits-Saint-George wines are difficult, especially in their youth. In style they are closer to Gevrey-Chambertin but with less gravitas. I find Clos Vougeot wines the most difficult to fathom - largely because the vineyard is divided among too many growers.\n\nChambolle-Musigny is my favourite village. Lightness of touch, silky, gossamer-like texture, almost bordering on transparency, and a perfume that is almost ethereal in its lightness, yet leaving a deep imprint in one's memory bank. And they make one wonder how is it possible that such a wine could come just from grapes. I think of Musigny as Burgundy's Lafite. Both remind me of the saying \"the lightness of being\".\n\nI recall that when Frederic Mugnier, of Domaine J F Mugnier was asked what he saw as his role in the making of his wine, his answer was: \"I do nothing. I had to learn how to do nothing!\" A profound statement. \"Learn to do nothing.\" His principal job was to prevent any complications from happening, e.g. maintaining the correct temperature of the cellar. What Frederic meant to convey was that left to themselves the grapes will make their own wine. And it will be the best wine possible.\n\nThese three wines also amply showed that you do not need to go to the Grand Cru level to find the best and the most enjoyable wines. Even at the lowest \"cru\" level, Village, one can find great joy and great wines. This also applies to the wines from all other wine-growing regions. And they also exemplify a very important principle. One that is similar to horse-racing.\n\nFollow the wine-grower. He decides which varietal is the most appropriate, the most likely to be suitable to plant for his vineyard. Put in another way, he searches for the most favourable terroir for the particular varietal he has in mind, e.g. Pinot Noir. Alternatively he searches for the most suitable varietal for the vineyard site he has in mind or bought. Having planted the vines, he has to tend them through the seasons, decide whether to go organic or go fully biodynamic, watch the weather, and decide when is the best time to harvest.\n\nHaving harvested, he makes the decision whether to de-stalk or not, and then watch over the fermentation like a security-guard. His active part is resumed after fermentation is complete, at which time the decision regarding choice of barrels, new or old, etc has to be made. The final decision is bottling time. One more decision. How long to cellar the bottles before releasing for sale.\n\nBurgundy is a very personal matter. To both wine grower and wine lover.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That means about 4 GW of clean-energy projects are up for sale - more than 10 percent of the nation's existing solar and wind capacity, according to industry executives.\n\n\"There are 2 GW-odd of wind assets comprising medium and small portfolios,\" Rahul Shah, chief executive at Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd, the clean-energy arm of Tata Power Co, said in an interview in Mumbai. \"In solar, again, 2 GW-odd finished and unfinished projects are looking for buyers.\"\n\nA gigawatt is about as much as a nuclear reactor can produce, and global solar installations last year were about 40 GW. That much capacity on the market threatens to push down prices and make lenders reluctant to finance projects - meaning a portion of the projects being planned could ultimately be scuppered. In turn, that would endanger Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target to install 100 GW of solar energy by 2020 at an estimated cost of US$100 billion.\n\nIndia has 6.7 GW of solar capacity and 26.7 GW of wind power, according to the latest government data.\n\nA drop in tariffs paid for solar power is being blamed for distorting the Indian clean-energy market. SunEdison is partly behind that trend, having taken all 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity offered in an auction last November in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. It offered to sell electricity at a record low for India at the time.\n\nSolar tariffs in India have fallen sharply from 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in July 2015 to a record low of 6 cents a kilowatt-hour in January this year.\n\n\"For the likes of SunEdison, who may have to get some kind of capital to be able to build the committed projects, it will mostly be desperate deals at this stage,\" Jasmeet Khurana, associate director for consulting at solar researcher Bridge to India, said in an interview in New Delhi. \"Premiums will come down because there will be desperate deals.\"\n\nMoreover, some projects may have difficulty finding buyers if the delivery deadline set by power purchase agreements is nearing and the projects aren't yet completed, according to Kailash Vaswani, deputy chief financial officer at ReNew Power Ventures Pvt, an Indian clean-energy company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n\"If one fails to deliver projects on time, the power purchase agreement is scrapped. So unbuilt projects will find it very hard to be sold if that kind of a time bomb is ticking away,\" Mr Vaswani said in an interview in New Delhi on Tuesday. \"Many of these assets may not even get built.\"\n\nInvestment bankers trying to match buyers and sellers for clean-energy assets say there is limited scope for significant premiums for projects awarded recently.\n\n\"This is driven by increased aggressiveness in project assumptions and an overall tightening of returns,\" Rahul Goswami, a managing director at clean-energy investment bank Greenstone Energy Advisors, said in an e-mail.\n\nGreenstone Energy is involved in some of the transactions involving renewable capacity.\n\nLower prices for solar energy are only desirable so long as they can be maintained, according to International Finance Corp (IFC), a unit of the World Bank. Gaetan Tiberghien, principal investment officer on infrastructure and natural resources for IFC South Asia, said the market must allow investors to earn a return to keep them interested in funnelling money into green-energy projects in India.\n\n\"If the risk-return balance is not adequate, there is an increased probability that fewer investors will bid and that awarded projects don't get built,\" Mr Tiberghien said by e-mail.\n\nIndia already faces several hurdles in financing PM Modi's ambitions for renewable energy. Central bank data shows that about 14 per cent of loans to the industry have soured or been written off.\n\nSunEdison's filing isn't helping. Last week, SunEdison listed US$16.1 billion of debt in Chapter 11 filings in Manhattan federal court - making it the biggest US bankruptcy in more than a year. The company, based in Maryland Heights, Missouri, has 700 MW of commissioned assets in India and 1.7 GW of projects being planned.\n\n\"Half of the solar installations in the country are looking for buyers, and it's a buyer's market,\" said Ravi Khanna, CEO of solar business at Aditya Birla Group, an Indian manufacturer in the Fortune 500.

That helped the South Korean company withstand the impact of a global smartphone slowdown that hit prices at its semiconductor and display businesses.\n\nStill, there's growing concern that Samsung, Apple and the rest of the industry will struggle to come up with a new must-have product that will entice consumers to replace their devices, which have become the nexus of peoples' digital lives. Global smartphone shipments fell 3 per cent in the first three months of the year, marking their first-ever decline, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\n\"The lingering market question about what could replace smartphones has not been fully addressed,\" said Lee Seung Woo, an analyst at IBK Securities Co. \"All technology gurus, from Apple to Qualcomm, are struggling now but Samsung fared better in the first quarter, partly helped by weaker local currency, but I don't think that positive impact will remain intact in the quarters ahead.\"\n\nNet income, excluding minority interests, rose to 5.26 trillion won (S$6.2 billion) in the three months ended March, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in a filing on Thursday. That compares with the 4.42 trillion-won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung also said it will buy back 2.03 trillion won worth of common and preferred shares.\n\n\"Moving up the S7 release date to March, about a month earlier than the predecessor, even at a lower price was a good strategy for Samsung,\" Dohoon Lee, an analyst at CIMB Securities, said in Seoul before the earnings release.\n\nSamsung's sales rose 5.6 per cent to 49.8 trillion won during the period, compared with estimates for 48.8 trillion won. The weaker Korean won against major currencies in the first quarter positively impacted operating profit by about 400 billion won, reflected mainly in the component business, Samsung said.\n\nShares of Samsung fell 2.3 per cent as at midday on Thursday. The stock is mostly unchanged this year following three straight annual declines.\n\n\"The market is still wondering what will be the next growth driver for Samsung and what its life would be like after smartphones,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nOperating profit at the mobile unit rose to 3.89 trillion won from 2.74 trillion won a year earlier. The revival of demand for the top-end model was also accompanied by strong growth in its cheaper line-ups, such as J series, said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.\n\n\"Compared to the Galaxy S6 series performance last year, the S7 series is showing as much as 50 percent higher sales during its opening month of sales in some markets,\" Counterpoint said in an April 7 report.\n\nFor the second quarter, Samsung said it anticipates solid performance, driven by steady earnings in the mobile and chip businesses plus improvement of the home appliance and display divisions. Looking ahead to the rest of 2016, the company expects the mobile, home appliance, and TV businesses to continue to generate higher earnings while focusing on stabilising the component business in the second half.\n\n\"If sales growth maintained at this rate, the S7 sales will show a clear distinction compared to its predecessors,\" Lee Kyeong-Tae, vice president of Samsung's mobile business, said on a conference call. \"We also introduced new mid-range models in the first quarter and the A series is selling particularly well in Europe and China, while J series is also selling well in emerging countries.\"\n\nOperating income at the chip unit was 2.63 trillion won, compared with 2.93 trillion won a year earlier as the slackening demand pressured component prices, including semiconductors and displays.\n\nThe operating loss from displays was 270 billion won, compared with a profit of 520 billion won a year earlier, amid persistent price declines of liquid crystal displays.\n\nThe unit, the market leader of screens using organic light-emitting diodes for smaller devices, is in exclusive talks with Apple to supply screens for iPhone models scheduled for release next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The annual plan for capital expenditure has not yet been confirmed but is projected to increase slightly compared to last year's based on various business opportunities. Display panel spending may increase this year as the company sees strong market demand for OLED panels, it said.\n\n\"We expect demand for OLEDs will continue to grow in the smartphone market and if deemed necessary, we will execute further investment at the right time,\" said Lee Chang-Hoon, vice president of Samsung Display.\n\nOperating profit at the consumer electronics division, which comprises TV and home appliance businesses, was 510 billion won in the quarter, reversing a loss of 140 billion won a year earlier, largely driven by higher profit from television sales amid falling panel prices.

The answer: nothing.\n\nFlag in hand (and tongue firmly in cheek), Moore then attempts to \"conquer\" Europe (with a detour to Tunisia in North Africa) as a one-man-army, in hopes of stealing ideas he can import to make his country greater.\n\nThe results are often rib-tickling and jaw-dropping at the same time as the Michigan native discovers free education in Slovenia, restaurant-standard four-course school meals in France, prisons that look like holiday resorts in Norway, no homework for children in Finland, women in the boardroom who bail Iceland out of an economic crisis, and workers who get four weeks of paid leave and two-hour lunch breaks in Italy.\n\nIt's an inspiring 120 minutes of popcorn socialism which probably deserves its own spin-off reality series featuring more destinations.\n\nMoore candidly paints a picture of the grass being greener on the other side but for a change, the natural born leftist goes slightly easy on his usual America-bashing. (The inside joke, of course, is all these fantastic ideas originated from the US before being adopted and adapted by the rest of the world.)\n\nWhere to Invade Next is as optimistic as it is one-sided (\"My mission is to pick the flowers, not the weeds,\" Moore tells the audience) so the picture often turns out to be a rosy one.\n\nBut as radical as some of the ideas might sound, Moore also shows the statistics to prove they can actually work.\n\nIn Norway, for instance, the maximum penalty is 21 years' imprisonment for murder and yet recidivism rate remains a low 20 per cent. And in Portugal, drug use went down after it was made legal. (In one of the film's funniest scenes, Moore tries his best to bait his own arrest by telling a pair of Portuguese police officers he's carrying cocaine while the former remains indifferent to the admission.)\n\nIt's a sly piece of documentary-making which Moore convincingly pulls off and Where to Invade Next would be easy to write off if not for the fact he actually looks sincere about showing America - and the rest of the world, for that matter, if they are watching this - that there is always a better way of running things.\n\nRating: B+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The site is expected to fetch eight to 16 bids.\n\nHowever, R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng predicts only four to seven bids - citing the project's sizeable development cost, notwithstanding developers' continued strong appetite when it comes to restocking their land bank.\n\nForecasts for the winning bid generally converged around the S$930-1,020 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) band. However, Mr Ong of JLL was more bullish; he expects the top bid to come in at between S$1,000 psf ppr and S$1,200 psf ppr.\n\n\"While the absolute land price would be high and pricey end-products more difficult to market, the lack of new development opportunities as well as an improved mood in the market will probably result in keen competition for this site,\" he said.\n\nDesmond Sim, the Singapore and South-east Asia head of CBRE Research, expects participation from the big boys at the tender. \"Mid-sized players may form joint ventures to spread out the development risk; the total development cost for this project will be quite hefty, possibly around S$700 million.\"\n\nMr Ong of R'ST expects the winning bidder to sell units in the future project on the site at an average price of S$1,800-1,950 psf, assuming the project is launched in the first half of next year.\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak highlighted that there are very few new 99-year leasehold residential developments in the area. \"As a result, it is quite possible that the new condo project on this site will be launched within the next two years at prices that are near to the transacted prices of freehold condos in the vicinity.\"\n\nThe tender for the site, which is being conducted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, closes on June 28.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the central region, prices of homes (excluding small units) fell 0.5 per cent. This reversed gains of 0.4 per cent for homes in the non-central region (excluding small units) and 0.7 per cent for homes in the central region (excluding small units) seen in February.\n\nEugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Realty Network, said there might be less movement in prices in the central region in the coming months, as more buyers and investors hunt for value.\n\nMeanwhile, small units (those with a floor area of 506 square feet and below) fell one per cent in March compared to the previous month, according to the SRPI which is compiled by the National University of Singapore's Institute of Real Estate Studies. This was on the back of a similar one per cent fall in February.\n\nLee Nai Jia, regional head (SEA), research, at DTZ, noted that overall, shoebox units have depreciated more than conventional units, citing competition from newly launched developments, which are located in prime locations and have better accessibility to more amenities.\n\n\"Additionally, some owners that face difficulties subletting their shoebox apartments are willing to take a larger loss during a sale,\" he noted.\n\nLooking ahead, R'ST Research's Ong Kah Seng said he expects the increased buzz in developer sales to encourage buyers to firm up their decisions on whether or not to purchase a resale property. This will likely mitigate the monthly price fall of completed properties in the outside central region.\n\nThat being said, he expects prices of completed properties in the non-central region to continue to decline or stagnate due to increased completion of suburban condominiums resulting in intensified leasing competition. Overall, he expects a full-year fall of about 5 per cent in the prices of completed properties in the outside central region.\n\nERA's Mr Lim is also of the view that there will be marginal monthly fluctuations in the months ahead, with the general trend being a gradual price decline. He cited challenging economic conditions and weak economic growth and labour market.\n\nR'ST's Mr Ong noted that despite the headwinds, buyers are increasingly appreciative of the value proposition of completed homes versus developer sales. \"Completed properties come in all shapes and sizes, conditions and designs - compared with developer sale (units) which tend to offer mainly properties with stylish design but are fairly 'shrunken (in) size', or contemporary projects which are 'too neat' and lack some (of that) interesting, old world, old feel charm. (A) handful of buyers like old completed properties which provides nostalgic feel and which are in niche, city fringe or quiet parts of suburban localities.\n\n\"Intent buyers may be able to chance upon tastefully renovated units, and, it is unlikely that sellers are asking for significantly high prices in such weak market times - more or less they are asking for reasonable price premium or even market rates.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Successive financial crises in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere in which bankers (using other people's money) got their fingers badly burnt through imprudent lending bears ample witness to this fact.\n\nJapanese bankers are by no means immune from such folly and in recent decades they too have been badly burned or \"squeezed\" by funding crises in Asia and elsewhere. Now, they are deeper in than ever, it would appear from recent warnings by the Bank of Japan and Japan's Financial Services Agency. Allowance must be made for the fact that Japanese banks suffer from a particular disadvantage when they lend overseas. This is that relatively few borrowers wish to borrow yen which, rightly or wrongly, they regard as being a \"volatile\" currency. Overwhelmingly, they prefer the dollar or sometimes the euro.\n\nJapanese banks are super-flush with yen deposits in Japan where loan demand has long been depressed (despite record low interest rates) by a stagnant economy. But since almost no one outside of Japan wants to borrow in yen, Japanese banks must procure dollars to on-lend.\n\nMarkets exist for this purpose - the interbank market, for example, where foreign currency can be procured but it is normally available only for short periods, measured in months rather than the, say, three-year, five-year or longer-term loans banks need to make.\n\nSo, the borrowed interbank funds have be constantly \"rolled over\". Banks must borrow in dollars from these markets or buy currency-hedging instruments in other markets where they can be squeezed by variable funding costs or maturity mismatches. All well and good when things are going smoothly in financial markets but that seems far from being the case for very long. When interest rates or currencies fluctuate, Japanese banks find that funding becomes more costly or even dries up and they need to pay a \"Japan premium\" in order to borrow.\n\nPushed by declining interest rates in Japan and their recent dip into negative territory, Japanese banks have stepped up their overseas lending dramatically to the point where the BOJ believes that \"vigilance\" is called for over currency risks that banks may be courting.\n\nThe banks have been looking to overseas loan markets in Asia, North America, Europe and elsewhere - to the point where their overseas lending exposure now exceeds that of British, European and US banks.\n\nSome 30-40 per cent of total assets at the Big Three (Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group) are now represented by overseas loans, made by overseas branches or in foreign currency loans extended from Japan.\n\nForeign currency loans by the three megabanks have more than doubled to over 70 trillion yen (S$868.6 billion) by 2016 from around 30 trillion yen in 2010, according to the BOJ. Japanese regional banks' foreign currency loans have, meanwhile, more than tripled to around three trillion yen. Record low interest rates in the US during a long period of \"unconventional monetary policy\" meant that borrowers were eager for dollars while US and other banks were happy to lend to Japanese banks in the interbank market for a modest premium. That is changing now, as US rates begin to rise. All this has the makings of a classic squeeze on Japanese banks and the authorities in Tokyo are right to be concerned. The BOJ is not eager to act as a \"lender of last resort\" to underwrite the imprudence of commercial banks. So, we could be looking at yet another banking crisis before very long.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Below are three solutions being developed.\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Apr 28, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nEye on even the smallest cracks\n\nTO carry out inspections for cracks in the cranes at the port, teams of three use platforms to access critical areas. When these areas are out of reach, the inspectors use cameras with zoom lenses to get a better look, although clear images may not always be possible. To overcome this problem, PSA is developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a high resolution camera that can get closer to hard-to-reach areas of quay cranes without putting the inspectors at risk from working at height.\n\nAt the heart of the system is a high resolution, 42-megapixel camera that uses intelligent image and video analytics and thermal imaging to detect even small cracks. The camera will be mounted on a lightweight UAV platform that together will weigh about 7kg and span just over a metre across, making it easily transportable by vehicle. The UAV, which would be remotely controlled by the inspectors, is designed to take off and land vertically, and hover in flight much like a helicopter.\n\n\"Such characteristics are ideal for the inspection role that the system is designed for. We are currently configuring the camera system, particularly the image analytics. We will start using the UAV in our port from 2017,\" said Nelson Quek, head of engineering at PSA Corporation.\n\nThe system can scan a variety of surface conditions to differentiate between benign surface blemishes and actual cracks that need to be attended to. Meanwhile, the camera can perform even in low light, and operate when the UAV is in flight. Video images can also be sent back to the inspectors on the ground in real time.\n\nMr Quek noted that it currently takes 14 man-days a year to thoroughly inspect a quay crane. With the new system, PSA aims to reduce it by almost 1.5 man-days over the same period.\n\n\"What is more significant is that our inspection teams would be able to leverage the greatly enhanced capability to access hard-to-reach areas of the quay crane without the risk of working from height to detect corrosion and cracks,\" he said. \"They will also benefit from an intelligent imaging system that can detect potential issues on our cranes.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Quek said that the consolidation of container port activities at the new Tuas Port would present many opportunities to develop or test new technologies. When completed, Tuas Port will have a scale of operations larger than any port in the world, with an annual capacity of 65 million TEUs.\n\nAlong with the UAV project, PSA is also progressively adopting a wide range of unmanned technologies including automated cranes and automated guided vehicles.\n\n\"In close collaboration with the Singapore government, technology providers, local institutes of higher learning, research institutes and other industry partners, PSA seeks to achieve breakthroughs in productivity, efficiency and reliability in its business operations,\" said Mr Quek.\n\nBetter decision processes with analytics system\n\nA PROJECT by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and IBM aims to give MPA staff insights to help them make better decisions in their daily tasks.\n\nThe two-year effort will see the development of a prototype analytics system that will allow users to infer events of interest from the data, also known as \"sense-making\", and also forecast congestion at the port based on predicted vessel arrival times. It will also have a social media component that monitors the social media for events of concern to MPA, such as oil spill or pollution in Singapore waters, as well as potential security threats.\n\nDuring the last six months of the project, IBM will install a live running version of the prototype at the MPA offices for staff to try using as part of their daily activities. The system will then be refined based on MPA user feedback. Officially launched in February this year, the live trial of the solution is scheduled to be rolled out with MPA in the second half of 2017.\n\n\"One of our main targets is to provide the relevant MPA departments with a unified environment for accessing the sense-making and predictive insights.\n\n\"The other main target is that each relevant department gains value from the system,\" explained Dr Laura Wynter, director of the IBM Research Collaboratory in Singapore.\n\nFor instance, in the area of maritime safety, the system can alert MPA staff in real-time to potential hazardous issues that warrant their investigation.\n\nSaid Dr Wynter: \"Each should be alerted in a timely manner, automatically, to issues that they would not otherwise have been aware of, issues discovered directly from the fusion of the multiple data sources and the sense-making and predictive analytics that run on that data.\"\n\nIntelligent ships in the making\n\nA SOLUTION being developed by local technology firm Ascenz will be able to capture vital shipboard information and seamlessly transmit it back to shore for further analysis. The company's Shipulse Data Acquisition System (DAS) integrates with shipboard sensors to collect and transmit the data through both satellite and GSM networks.\n\nThe system is designed to track key metrics related to fuel consumption, engine, hull and propeller performance. For instance, it can promote transparency in a ship's procurement of bunkers, or marine fuel, by remotely monitoring bunkering transactions - including the volume and quality of the fuel delivered.\n\n\"It transforms vessels into smart ships. The Shipulse solution is based on capturing real time data with accuracy - directly from sensors and not crew - and computing them to provide analytical data that aids in decision making to optimise vessel performance. This works on most vessels, including workboats and ocean going vessels,\" said Sia Teck Chong, chief technology officer at Ascenz.\n\nThe company has been officially working on this project since November last year and is currently at the Beta launch stage with customers on board using and testing the solution.\n\nThe company will also be acquiring and verifying data at this stage to ensure that the data corresponds with established models with the highest accuracy possible, said Mr Sia.\n\n\"This is crucial as the formula can only be proven with access to and collection of large amount of data used in the verification process.

Equity markets swooned in February with DBS shares down 20 per cent from the beginning of the year amid plunging oil prices and gloomy reports on China's slowdown.\n\nFuelling market panic was a dire warning from Swiss hedge fund manager Felix Zulauf that the Chinese economy will suffer a hard landing - and in turn trigger a Singapore banking crisis as banks' loans here have grown from large foreign inflows.\n\nAt Thursday's price of S$15.44, those 200,000 shares are worth S$3.1 million, resulting in an 11 per cent profit or more than S$300,000 for Mr Gupta.\n\nHe said Singapore banks' loan books have grown from trade finance but the business was funded from short-term commercial paper, and the trade finance business has since shrunk. The CEO said the hedge fund manager's comment shows he was \"misinformed\" or \"has an agenda\".\n\nMr Gupta also sought to assure shareholders that DBS's home loans book was very healthy even as real estate prices continue to weaken.\n\nPrivate home prices fell 3.7 per cent last year, after declining 4 per cent in 2014. And one property consultant has projected that prices could fall as much as 4 per cent in 2016.\n\nMost of DBS home loans were for owner occupation, and the bank has the lowest investment property loans, resulting in the lowest delinquency rate and lowest bad debts compared with its rivals, said Mr Gupta.\n\nTo a question on the bank's trading income, which was S$1 billion last year, he said DBS has reduced this from 20 per cent to 10 per cent in the last five years because it is volatile.\n\nHe said a large part of trading income comes from interest rate income, which is short-term in nature. The bank does trade on its own account, taking \"very small positions\" and does so when there are requirements from customers, he said.\n\nOn where growth will come from in the next 3-5 years, Mr Gupta said DBS has three main segments: institutional banking; small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs); and consumer and wealth management.\n\nInstitutional banking, which grew strongly in the past several years, is now slowing. It had been driven by corporatisation of Indian and Chinese companies becoming bigger.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012/13, large corporates and SME banking grew quite fast, while consumer and wealth was slower, Mr Gupta said. \"In the last couple of years, it's been reversed,\" he said, due to the slowdown in China. \"It's a great time to push the pedal on consumer.\"\n\nIn 2015, DBS institutional banking income rose 7 per cent and SME banking income grew 9 per cent, but consumer banking rose a faster 23 per cent.\n\nOne shareholder asked about risks, including the impact of Donald Trump possibly becoming the next US president. The billionaire has advocated protectionism and raising punitive import tariffs.\n\nDBS chairman Peter Seah said the US impact on the rest of the world is very great.\n\n\"We do share your concerns given that Donald Trump has been winning all the primaries,\" said Mr Seah.\n\nMr Trump won five primaries this week, putting him on track to be the Republican Party's nominee for the US presidential election in November.\n\nThe British magazine The Economist has warned that a Trump presidency and the prospect of costly trade wars between the US and emerging economies pose a top-10 risk event that could disrupt the world economy, by igniting turmoil in the financial markets that could lead to a global recession.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What we've done is entered into a joint agreement, where they not only identify and execute opportunities and do the asset management, but they will also co-invest. They'll put their money into anything we do together. It's very important that we have that alignment of interest, because it means the relationship is a real partnership as opposed to a service arrangement.\"\n\nCIT announced the new agreement on Thursday morning, as it released its earnings report for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016.\n\nIts distribution per unit (DPU) fell 9.2 per cent to 1.112 Singapore cents, from 1.225 cents in the corresponding quarter a year ago. However, adjusted DPU - with Q1 2015 figures tweaked to reflect management fees wholly paid in cash and no capital distribution for a like-for-like comparison - rose 3.8 per cent year-on-year.\n\nGross revenue rose 3.2 per cent to S$28.4 million, and net property income rose 1.2 per cent to S$21.5 million.\n\nAs for its outlook, the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016, CIT's manager said that approximately 20.2 per cent of CIT's leases are due for renewal in FY2016, of which 13.1 per cent (eight properties) are for single-tenanted buildings and 7.1 per cent are for multi-tenanted buildings.\n\nThe Reit expects to convert one of the single-tenanted buildings to a multi-tenanted one. It also intends to renew or enter into new leases for four properties, deploy asset enhancements to one property, and divest two properties.\n\nAs for other corporate developments, Mr Levinson highlighted how Goldman Sachs (Singapore) has been appointed to assist with a strategic review of CIT's business and operations. Goldman Sachs will be analysing certain recent trends and developments in the Singapore Reit sector, and their potential implications on CIT. He added that the focus will continue to be on tenant retention, cost savings measures, and proactive asset management.\n\nUnits of the trust rose a cent to S$0.545 on Thursday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That showcase itself marked the return of Singapore at the prestigious biennale after being absent from the 2013 edition, following a controversial short-lived government decision to discontinue participation.\n\nExternal factors aside, the work itself seems to call on Singaporeans to re-examine our relationship with the sea. For an island state surrounded by water, many Singaporeans have grown curiously indifferent to the sea. Because the waters have become less than ideal for swimming and wading compared to that of our nearby neighbours, we tend to engage in more land recreation activities instead of sea ones. This is despite the fact that the sea is never more than 14km away from us, wherever on the island we may be.\n\nWorking with curator Shabbir Hussain Mustafa, Lim uses video, photographs, collage, data and other media to document, as he puts it, the \"biophysical, aspirational and cerebral contours of the South-east Asian city, through the visible and invisible lenses of the sea\".\n\nHis most visually-pleasurable work is a long video installation comprising several screens showing transport ships plying our seas. Here, the images are displayed vertically instead of horizontally so as to appear almost like a moving Ian Davenport painting.\n\nIn other videos, Lim displays his unerring sense of visual composition. Whether he's capturing an underground storage tank, an abandoned swimming pool or dank canals, he films them with a kind of hallowed reverence that imbues these images with a mystical, otherworldly quality. Many a time, this journalist found himself doubting if the videos were indeed shot in Singapore.\n\nOn a large wall, Lim displays more than 100 photographs of buoys floating in our waters. Each one has been photographed from two perspectives - one looking inland to a Singapore coastline and the other looking outward to the sea - so as to once again mix up one's ideas of boundaries and home. He then tops this off with an actual five-metre-tall buoy that he made himself, left out at sea to be encrusted with barnacles and then dragged out back to land to be stationed in the gallery.\n\nThe entire exhibition works as an attempt, as Lim put it himself, to \"come clean\" with Singapore's relationship with its much-exploited waters - or as Mustafa put it, \"to recognise the sea for how it has been corporatised and militarised\".\n\nThe clear blue sea that older Singaporeans once frequented and loved may no longer be there. But Sea State posits the possibility of entering a renewed but much more complex relationship with it.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In contrast, domestic contributions from international MNCs (multinational corporations) may fall over time,\" they said.\n\nIf so, a re-examination of how economic growth is measured in Singapore could be necessary - with the focus gradually shifting towards gross national income (GNI) from gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nGDP is defined as the value of all goods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of the country; it includes the value-added by foreigners and foreign entities in Singapore, but omits the incomes earned by Singaporeans or Singapore companies based overseas. GNI, in contrast, measures the income earned by Singaporeans - regardless of whether it is earned domestically or abroad.\n\n\"This indicator will more accurately capture the income and/or value created if Singapore's economic structure becomes more outward driven as mentioned,\" added the pair.\n\nThey noted that this outward investment strategy should yield positive returns in the longer term, judging from the experiences of Japan and Taiwan.\n\nAlready, Singapore's outward direct investment has been rising steadily over the years. Still, it remains small compared to foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.\n\n\"From a policy perspective, while FDI and the presence of MNCs will remain a key feature of Singapore's economic landscape, having a pool of globally successful local companies could help sustain national incomes in the face of rising domestic cost pressures and the challenges of an ageing population,\" said Mr Seah and Ms Ma.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It isn't known what these breaches might be - the speculation being market manipulation and rigging - yet the response to the raids by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) has been odd, to say the least.\n\nSome trading representatives and their clients were critical, with sceptical remarks to the effect that the raid was \"a waste of time\", \"too little too late\" or that regulatory energies would be better spent bringing to justice the parties behind the S-chip collapse and other scandal-tainted stocks.\n\nAnother response was that this was the last thing that the Singapore Exchange needed, what with market confidence already so low and trading business depressed. Investors, it was claimed, would be exasperated at the news of the raids and would wonder why Singapore's reputation for being corruption-free didn't extend to the stock market.\n\nWhere is the logic?\n\nIt is difficult to understand the logic of questioning actions aimed at strengthening governance and protecting investors. Even if we accept that some degree of cynicism over officialdom's actions is common in all spheres of life, taken to their logical conclusion, such responses beggar belief because they imply that even if the raids relate to breaches of the law, it would have been better not to investigate because (a) the possible breaches are minor and so resources shouldn't be wasted and (b) signalling to the market that the authorities are looking into possible wrongdoings would damage investor confidence.\n\nArgument (a) is impossible to accept as it implies that false markets and insider trading are acceptable features in the stock market and should be overlooked, whilst (b) postulates that an international arena that thrives on greed and fear has to be 100 per cent corruption-free in the case of Singapore, even if in the most developed and well-regulated markets like London, Australia and the US, breaches of the law regularly surface and dozens of official probes are routinely ongoing at any one time.\n\nThe reason why some people indulge in illegal market activity is, of course, the perception that rewards are substantial and far outweigh the risks.\n\nThis is why despite the massive financial losses that manipulators suffer when regulators step in, many will still try their luck. Stock market shenanigans have gone on for decades, ever since the idea was born that in a capitalist society, equities should be freely traded in order to set fair prices and facilitate capital raising, and will continue for as long as this ideal holds sway.\n\nIf, however, the playing field for the trading of those equities is perceived as being uneven because of certain activities classified as illegal, confidence would be lost. It is therefore incumbent upon regulators to do their best to intervene, nip problems in the bud, level the trading ground and, in so doing, restore confidence.\n\nIllegal activity\n\nIn some cases, the illegal activity is easily detectable and actionable. In others though, it may be easily detected but taking action may not be as simple. In yet other instances, detection may be difficult and proving the rules have been broken even harder.\n\nIt is always easy to fire criticism from the sidelines without full knowledge of the constraints under which investigators operate. Because multiple agencies and jurisdictions are often involved, it can take years to investigate some cases, and even then there's no guarantee of convictions.\n\nSo whilst many fair-minded observers would like all crimes and guilty parties to be exposed and punished, it may not be possible because building water-tight cases all the time is impossible.\n\nBut at least the effort is being made and instead of confidence being eroded by last week's raids, it would clearly be enhanced. It is only through tough regulatory action that confidence and trust in stocks can be instilled, and the more people that recognise this, the better.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It noted similarly that incomes had climbed while household spending had slowed.\n\nThe case against higher rates is basically that it makes sense to err on the side of stimulus. By holding borrowing costs at low levels, officials say, it would be relatively easy to respond to stronger inflation by doing less to encourage spending and borrowing. If the Fed raises rates prematurely, however, it will have little room to correct the error by doing more.\n\nThe central bank left itself room to manoeuvre though and the Fed's two-handed assessment of economic conditions appeared to confuse financial markets. Investors initially bid up yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, suggesting they expected interest rates to rise more quickly than anticipated before the meeting. But then they reversed course and drove yields sharply lower. The 10-year yield ended the trading day down 4 per cent at 1.85 per cent.\n\nSome analysts still think the Fed may raise rates at its next meeting, in June, particularly if other economic indicators show the same strength as job growth. Others, however, said they did not expect a rate increase until later in the year.\n\nOverall, investors are betting against June, putting the chance of an increase around 20 per cent, and the Fed on Wednesday made little effort to change minds.\n\n\"There was a distinct absence of teeing up a hike in June,\" economists at BNP Paribas wrote in an analysis. \"Indeed, it is difficult to see how a hike could be delivered, despite reduced external risks, until the economy takes on a more positive tone.\"\n\nTD Securities, which had predicted an increase in June, said it now expected none until September.\n\nThe Fed already had backed away from its December projection that it would raise rates four times this year. Officials in March predicted just two rate increases. But Janet L Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said this month that she did not regard the December increase as a mistake, and she and other officials have continued to suggest that more moves are likely this year.\n\n\"I said at the time and continue to feel that the economy had made very substantial progress,\" she said at an event in New York.\n\nOther officials, too, have cautioned against assuming too much caution.\n\n\"I do not see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the exceptionally shallow interest rate path currently reflected in financial futures markets,\" Eric S Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in New Britain, Connecticut, last week.\n\nWhile the Fed's latest statement acknowledged the weakness of some recent economic data, it also noted a number of reasons that growth could gain strength.\n\n\"Much of the weakness in economic activity that manifested in recent data appears to have been downplayed in the statement and is in any case largely in the rear view as far as the committee is concerned,\" said Michael Dolega, a senior economist at TD Bank.\n\nFor example, there is a divide in the recent rounds of government data between the reported strength of job growth and the reported weakness of overall economic activity. The early estimates of job growth are historically more accurate, and the Fed's choice of language suggested Fed officials think the reported economic weakness may be overstated. The statement described job growth as improved but said economic growth \"appears\" to have slowed.\n\nThe statement also suggested that the Fed's concerns about global economic weakness had diminished. The Fed's last statement, in March, described global conditions as a headwind for domestic growth. The April statement said merely that the Fed continued to monitor global economic and financial developments.

The fund invests in serviced residences and rental housing properties with an initial focus on Asia Pacific and Europe.\n\nLast November, it made its maiden acquisition of two properties in Paris and Tokyo for US$137 million. The luxury serviced residence near Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, La Clef Champs- \u00c9lys\u00e9es Paris, is set to open in 2018, while Somerset Shinagawa Tokyo is already operational.\n\nThe latest acquisition in Islington is scheduled to open in 2019. The project is close to London's West End and a 10-minute walk to The Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal Football Club.\n\nThe serviced apartments will be part of Islington Square, an integrated development developed by Sager Group. Islington Square will comprise 263 new homes and 170,000 square feet of retail and leisure facilities.\n\nThe property, which will be named Citadines Islington London, will reside within a beautifully restored Edwardian building - the former Royal Mail's sorting office, where its baroque facade and ornate detailing from more than a century ago will be preserved.\n\nLee Chee Koon, Ascott's chief executive officer, said the addition of Citadines Islington London will strengthen Ascott's position as one of the largest international serviced residence operators in Europe, with an asset size of over S$1.5 billion.\n\n\"Our portfolio in the region will increase to more than 5,300 units in 45 properties across France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Georgia, and Spain. We aim to double our portfolio in Europe to 10,000 units by 2020,\" he said.\n\nAscott has over 28,000 operating serviced residence units in key cities of the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, as well as over 17,000 units which are under development - totalling more than 45,000 units in over 290 properties.\n\nAscott's fund with QIA will provide the financial boost to support the company's acquisitions and growth as Ascott gears up to achieve its global target of 80,000 apartment units by 2020, Mr Lee added.\n\nSo far this year, Ascott has added 3,400 apartment units to its portfolio.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even 3 per cent, when it is a reaction to the BOJ, seems unlikely to provide justification.\"\n\nAfter a two-day policy meeting that ended on Wednesday, the Fed said global economic headwinds - widely seen as the main reason it has not pushed rates higher - remained on its radar while stopping short of mentioning the risks these posed.

Last year, a market regulator called the Financial Accounting Standards Board released a proposal that could make it easier for corporations to withhold important financial information from shareholders.\n\nThis could put the economy at greater risk of another huge accounting fraud, such as Enron or Lehman Brothers. But the board's proposal, which could become a final rule any day now, has got nowhere near the strong dose of sunlight it deserves.\n\nLet's back up. Current accounting standards require corporations to make financial disclosures of information that \"could\" influence investors. If this sounds wishy-washy, it is. The accounting board's proposal would rewrite this already subjective standard to require corporate disclosure only when there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that information \"would\" significantly alter investor decisions.\n\nThe language change is troublesome because it lowers the bar for excluding important or \"material\" information. Even just changing \"could\" to \"would\" is a big deal. \"Could\" connotes possibility and invites broader disclosure; \"would\" connotes more certainty and can be used by firms to exclude disclosure.\n\nImagine a pharmaceutical company that discovers that a promising new drug in the pipeline is performing poorly in patient trials. Such information \"could\" sway investing decisions, and, under current rules, there's a strong case for disclosure. But it's much harder to establish that there is \"substantial likelihood\" that disclosing this information \"would\" significantly alter investor choices. If the new proposal is enacted, the drug company gets a free pass to avoid disclosure.\n\nThe accounting board justifies its proposal by arguing that investors and businesses alike are suffering from disclosure overload - a point echoed by several special interests pushing for the changes, including the United States Chamber of Commerce and several powerful Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThere is some merit to this concern: Corporate financial disclosures are often foggy and impenetrable. But this calls for improved quality of disclosure - more plain English, less legalese - not weakening disclosure standards. This is particularly true with the advent of technology that enables rapid text searches.\n\nGiven the technological advances, we support re-examining the current rules that govern \"material\" corporate disclosure. After all, these rules haven't exactly served investors well. Consider the examples of Enron and Lehman.\n\nSHODDY, DECEPTIVE PRACTICES\n\nWhen Enron collapsed at the turn of this century, the fallout was devastating: thousands of jobless and countless investors left with worthless shares. As the company unravelled, we learnt that years of financial statements were little more than an illusion sustained by misleading and inadequate disclosures.\n\nEnron's conduct was fraudulent, of course; but the deceit was partly enabled by rules allowing the company to overstate assets by over US$1.5 billion because offsetting adjustments were \"determined to be immaterial\". With a still-lower threshold for disclosure, as the accounting board is now proposing, Enron could have cooked the books even further, and the resulting devastation could have been greater.\n\nMany remember Lehman as the firm whose crash ignited a global financial crisis; few recall how it exemplified the poor disclosure practices that were common in the years leading up to it. Not only did this fuzzy disclosure mislead markets on the health of the housing market, in Lehman's case it helped mask the firm's manipulation of financial statements. In one e-mail from early 2008, Lehman's president called its accounting gimmicks \"another drug we r on\".\n\nAmazingly, in the aftermath of Lehman's failure, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded that the company's non-disclosures did not violate current materiality standards.\n\nThere is reason to believe that such shoddy, deceptive practices remain common. A 2015 survey by researchers from Columbia, Duke, Emory and the National Bureau of Economic Research reveals that the nearly 400 financial executives surveyed believe 20 per cent of firms intentionally distort their earnings figures by an average of 10 per cent.\n\nDisclosure is the cornerstone of fair and efficient markets. Investors can make educated decisions only if they have access to relevant information about public companies. Weakening disclosure standards imperils the integrity of markets.\n\nIn principle, the SEC has the final authority to set disclosure rules for public companies. But the SEC decades ago turned over much of this work to the private-sector accounting standards board. This body draws its members largely from the accounting and finance professions, citing the need for expertise from industry. It's this state of affairs that has partly got us to where we are today.\n\nThe board's changes contradict the SEC's own strategic plan, which notes that \"an educated and informed investor ultimately provides the best defence against fraud and costly mistakes\". The accounting board should abandon its efforts to undermine disclosure rules. Even better, the SEC should use this opportunity to step in and strengthen them.

Multiple witnesses have also been interviewed.\n\n\"We have hundreds of thousands of documents to review that include communications between the accused and other persons of interest, as well as e-mails and transactional documents which the accused can also provide insight on,\" Mr Kwek argued, adding that Yeo's family members were also being investigated for money-laundering activities.\n\nYeo's lawyer, Philip Fong from Harry Elias Partnership, argued that the prosecution and CAD had been given \"more than ample time\" to investigate his client, hence there was no reason to hold him indefinitely.\n\n\"Two weeks have passed since Jiawei was arrested. Seven months have passed since he was called in for investigations. The enforcement authorities have had more than enough time to carry out their investigations,\" said Mr Fong.\n\nHe also stressed that Yeo was not a flight risk as he has a family and a three-year old daughter, and his passport has been impounded since Day One.\n\nDistrict Judge Christopher Goh granted prosecution's application to further remand Yeo and deny him access to lawyers.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBank Negara orders 1MDB to repatriate money sent overseas\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated Yeo had already received some US$1.6 million per year, when it should mean that he would be receiving some US$1.6 million per year.

Regional and local artistes such as singers Frances Yip, Dick Lee, Nathan Hartono, Joi Chua and Lauren Yeo, as well as flautist Rit Xu, performed alongside beneficiaries, among which were dancers from AWWA Senior Community Home, Beyond Social Services and Very Special Arts, as well as drummers from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) and APSN Tanglin School.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The economy grew at a 1.4 per cent pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlmost all sectors of the economy weakened in the first quarter, with the housing market the lone star.\n\nThe slowdown in growth is likely temporary, given a fairly robust jobs market. Applications for unemployment benefits are near a 43-year low and employment gains averaged 209,000 jobs per month in the first quarter.\n\nIn addition, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys, which are closely correlated to economic activity, have rebounded in recent months.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged economic activity had \"slowed\", it also said labour market conditions had \"improved further\".\n\nThe US central bank appeared to view the threats from the global economy and financial markets as having diminished.\n\nThe Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further. It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nEconomists also say the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite recent steps to address the problem.\n\nResidual seasonality has plagued first-quarter GDP, with growth underperforming in five of the last six years since the recovery started in June 2009.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased at a 1.9 per cent rate. That was the slowest since the first quarter of 2015 and was a deceleration from the fourth quarter's 2.4 per cent rate.\n\nHouseholds have been frugal, cutting back on purchases of cars, despite cheap petrol. Households appear to have socked away modest wage gains from the tightening labour market and the petrol savings. They have also reduced their debt.\n\nIncome at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation increased 2.9 per cent in the first quarter after rising 2.3 per cent in the prior period. Savings rose to a lofty US$712.3 billion from US$678.3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nHigher savings and a lower debt load augur well for an acceleration in consumer spending.\n\nTepid consumer spending gave businesses more reason to place fewer orders for goods and ramp up efforts to reduce an inventory bloat. In the first quarter, businesses accumulated US$60.9 billion worth of inventory, down from US$78.3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe small inventory build cut 0.33 percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth, up from the 0.22 percentage point drag in the fourth quarter.\n\nTrade subtracted 0.34 percentage point from GDP growth, with dollar strength weighing on exports and sucking in imports. The dollar gained 20 per cent versus the currencies of the United States' trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015.\n\nSo far this year the dollar is down 2.6 per cent on a trade weighted basis, raising optimism for a rebound in exports.\n\nA sustained plunge in energy sector investment put more pressure on business spending. Investment in equipment tumbled at a 8.6 per cent rate, the steepest decline since the second quarter of 2009.\n\nSpending on non-residential structures dropped at a 10.7 per cent pace as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts collapsed at a record 86 per cent rate. Investment in mining exploration contracted at a 39.6 per cent rate in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere were strong gains in residential investment in the first quarter, the only bright spot in the economy.

Analysts had expected a 484.3 million-euro loss, according to the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMr Cryan, under pressure to restore investor confidence in the lowest-valued major global lender, has pledged to eliminate 9,000 jobs, offload riskier assets and scrap dividends as part of a wider overhaul. With mounting costs tied to past misconduct, rising restructuring charges and tougher capital requirements weighing on earnings, the co-CEO said last month he doesn't expect Germany's largest bank to be profitable this year.\n\n\"It really was a historically bad start to the year and that had to hurt across the bank,\" Christian Hamann, an analyst at Hamburger Sparkasse, who has a neutral recommendation on the shares, said before earnings were published. \"The biggest area of focus though is costs, because that's where Deutsche Bank really lags many peers and it's the only factor they can really steer.\"\n\nDeutsche bank has dropped 26 per cent this year. At Credit Suisse Group AG, which is also shrinking its riskiest businesses, the shares have lost 31 per cent of their value in that period.\n\nMr Cryan's overhaul has been complicated by record-low interest rates, volatile markets and plunging commodity prices eroding earnings at the securities business, led by Garth Ritchie. The five largest US investment banks saw their combined trading revenue drop 22 per cent in the first quarter, with Barclays Plc on Wednesday reporting a 31 per cent drop in underlying pre-tax profit at the corporate and investment banking unit.\n\nDeutsche Bank executives have also struggled to reassure investors of the bank's financial strength and ability to pay coupons on certain debt securities. Mr Cryan has said that the lender's common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, will reach a low point in the first quarter.

After years of racking up profits by borrowing cheaply and ploughing the proceeds into higher-yielding debt, investors are now rushing to unwind those wagers amid the deepest sell-off in 13 months.\n\nThe bets are getting squeezed from both sides as bond prices sink and borrowing costs rise to one-year highs in the eight trillion yuan (S$1.66 trillion) market for repurchase agreements, used by traders to amplify their buying power.\n\nWhile a reduction in leveraged wagers is arguably good for China's long-term financial stability, it risks fuelling a downward spiral in a market that Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) says already shows signs of panic amid mounting default concerns.\n\nThe pullback challenges government efforts to revive economic growth with cheap credit and could hardly come at a worse time for Chinese companies on the hook for a record 547 billion yuan of maturing onshore notes in May.\n\n\"It looks like everybody is cutting their leverage, passively or pro-actively, as pessimistic sentiment continues to brew,\" said Wang Ming, chief operating officer at Shanghai Yaozhi Asset Management LLP, which oversees 15 billion yuan of fixed-income securities. \"Carry trades have become riskier.\"\n\nOutstanding positions in the repo market - where investors can pledge existing bond holdings for cash to invest in more debt - have dropped by 18 per cent this year through March, reversing a three-year climb to all-time highs in December. While it's unclear how many of those transactions were used to buy more bonds, analysts at Haitong Securities Co and Minsheng Securities Co both say repos are the best available proxy for leverage in China's debt market.\n\nIt's getting more expensive for investors to lever up as market volatility makes lenders more cautious and forecasters push back estimates for another central bank interest-rate cut to at least the fourth quarter. The cost of overnight repos has averaged 1.99 per cent this month, up from 1.14 per cent in June. \"There is still plenty of room for rates to go higher,\" Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG, wrote in a report on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors are getting hit on the other side of the trade, too, as bond prices slide. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch China Broad Market Index of total returns on yuan-denominated debt has declined 0.83 per cent from a record high on April 4.\n\nGovernment bonds have come under pressure as inflation increased to the highest since mid-2014, while corporate notes are slumping amid a spate of defaults and a surprise move by state-owned China Railway Materials Co to halt its bond trading this month because of what the company called \"repayment issues\".\n\n\"When you have a large SOE who suddenly suspends its bond trading, you think: 'How many more are there?',\" said Raja Mukherji, the Hong Kong-based head of Asian credit research at Pimco, which oversees about US$1.5 trillion worldwide. \"It kind of leads to a bit of panic in the onshore market. Investors are likely to want to look at their portfolio and sell some of the bonds.\"\n\nWhile the losses may look small relative to the wild swings in Chinese stocks last year, declines can be amplified in a bond market where Haitong estimates leverage rose to a record 109.4 per cent in February - meaning investors use an average 100 yuan of their own capital for every 109.4 yuan of bonds they purchase.\n\nTraders who bought near the peak of the market had little room for error: The yield difference between five-year sovereign notes and the overnight repo rate fell to a one-year low of 38 basis points on March 31.\n\n\"We have started to cut bond holdings, shorten duration and lower leverage from the first quarter,\" said Cheng Peng, the Beijing-based head of investments at Genial Flow Asset Management Co, which oversees about 20 billion yuan. \"We will be more cautious.\"\n\nA deep downturn in China's bond market is unlikely because regulators would step in to prevent losses from getting out of hand, according to Wei Zhen, a money manager at Bosera Asset Management Co in Shenzhen.\n\n\"We don't think there will be a big correction in the corporate bond market unless continuous and large-scale defaults trigger a liquidity crisis in the financial system,\" Mr Wei said. \"The probability of such systemic risks is very low given regulators' good care for the market.\"\n\nThe authorities have already signalled concern over the buildup in leverage. China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp surveyed some brokerages on the use of borrowed money in the exchange-traded bond market, people familiar with the matter said in December.\n\nRegulators also sent questionnaires to fund-management companies to seek information on their outstanding repo positions, the Securities Times reported on March 28, without citing anyone.\n\nChina's experience with the stock market shows how difficult it can be to contain a reversal in leveraged bets. Domestic shares lost more than US$5 trillion of value last summer after regulatory curbs helped cut outstanding margin debt in half.\n\nA prolonged sell-off in bond markets would have even greater impact on economic growth than the tumble in stocks. Net issuance of corporate debt swelled to 1.24 trillion yuan in the first quarter, or 19 per cent of total financing. That compares with 284 billion yuan of equity issuance by non-financial companies, central bank data show.\n\nAs defaults spread and China's central bank refrains from cutting interest rates, there could be more trouble ahead for bond investors, according to Sun Binbin, an analyst at China Merchants Securities Co.\n\n\"The volatility in funding costs, coupled with exposing credit risks, are draining the liquidity in the bond market,\" the analyst said. \"Given the market expectation of a neutral monetary policy stance, investors may continue to be forced to de-leverage.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

The chain guaranteed this by charging late fees.\n\n\"Instead of charging a late fee, Netflix offered a subscription model - pay a subscription and you can watch as many movies as you want. It was almost impossible for the market leaders to respond to,\" says Mr Anthony, the managing partner of Innosight who has advised senior leaders in companies such as Proctor & Gamble, Kraft and General Electric. He was speaking on the topic of disruptive innovation at the Credit Suisse Global Megatrends Conference 2016.\n\nDisruption in business also requires companies to take the complicated and make it simple, like what Airbnb has done for the housing rental market - making it easy for users to find exactly what they want, when they want it.\n\n\"Disruption transforms an existing market or creates one that doesn't exist by making the complicated simple, and the expensive affordable,\" Mr Anthony says.\n\nOnce you have disrupted the business model, companies must then build their solution on a technological platform that improves over time, and in the process make it harder for competitors to gain any traction.\n\nMr Anthony notes that car-hailing service Uber is constantly refining its solutions to better serve its customers. \"The Uber of today is not the same Uber of six months ago or the Uber of 18 months ago. Its platform keeps getting better and better and this is one of the things that makes Uber very hard to respond to,\" he says.\n\nAs for the incumbents, Mr Anthony says that they usually act too late even though disruptive competitors appear years before the eventual demise of the incumbents.\n\nKodak, for instance, was eventually bankrupted by the emergence of digital photography even though it was one of its own engineers who first developed the technology.\n\nMeanwhile, Nokia was at the top of the mobile phone market when Apple's iPhone and Google's Android platform appeared in 2007 but could do nothing to stop its downward spiral just a few years later.\n\n\"It's really hard when you get to the end of the story, when you still have a few good years and you have that growth and the new disruptive player is coming at you,\" he says. \"It's not like the end came overnight.\"\n\nDisruptive shifts have historically been at the root of what makes big companies fail. That said, even the new market leaders may not be safe as they may be susceptible to the next wave of disruption.\n\nMr Anthony cites some broad disruptive trends that are impacting the global economy. These include the rise of robots and drones, which can alter production and distribution. Amazon, for instance, is leveraging drones for a predictive technology it is developing that will deliver items to your doorstep even before you order based on your past consumption patterns.\n\nOther trends include additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, which will reconfigure global supply chains; immersive technology, as exemplified by the Internet of Things phenomenon; and \"everything as a service\", which is reshaping many industries.\n\nThis last trend refers to a wide range of services and applications that users can access on demand over the Internet through cloud computing platforms.\n\n\"Everything is being ripped apart by 'everything as a service', even my own job as a management consultant,\" Mr Anthony notes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Singapore has already planned for its next-generation port to be one that incorporates multiple information and communication technology (ICT) solutions (\n\nsee BT infographic\n\n).\n\nBut there are still hurdles to cross.\n\nMining of big data is a major one. This calls for a common pool of shared data, and the development process is akin to \"building a trust machine\", said a speaker from major ocean-carrier company APL at the seminar.\n\nIndustry players have to buy into the idea of sharing data that can be deemed competitively sensitive.\n\nInvestments will be needed to beef up cybersecurity, a concept that may not appeal to bottomline-driven business leaders.\n\nA key finding from a report conducted by cybersecurity firm Tanium and the Nasdaq, highlighted at SMW 2016's Maritime Cyber Security Seminar, was that 40 per cent of 1,500 surveyed executives did not feel personally responsible for the repercussions of hacking or for protecting their customers' data.\n\nSceptics would argue that convincing shareholders and bankers to support investments in new technology is an uphill task in a market downturn, let alone doing this for the area of cybersecurity.\n\nMargins in most key maritime sub-sectors are facing pressure from slowing demand and developing supply glut.\n\nOffshore marine players - among the worst hit by the collapse of oil prices - may look to a recovery in contracting activity only in 2018, said Kristian Siem, chairman of Siem Industries and Subsea 7, at the 10th Singapore Maritime Lecture (SML 2016).\n\nAt another event, Keppel Offshore & Marine (O&M) chief executive Chow Yew Yuen spoke on the importance of right-sizing the organisation to manage costs. Keppel O&M is looking for non-oil and gas projects that utilise its offshore equipment, such as that in the power sector, to ride through the storm in the oil-and-gas sector, he said.\n\nHowever, cost-cutting in this O&M downturn has fed investment in digital technology.\n\nMaersk Oil, for example, is incorporating a digital tool-kit on offshore platforms - a move that will yield more than US$10 million in savings from the Culzean gas project off the UK, the company said at a steel-cutting ceremony held in Singapore early this month.\n\nIn the containership sub-sector, an APL speaker, responding to a query on the benefits of smart-ship technologies, said the company's data shows between 25 and 30 per cent fuel savings from using digital technology, subject to the design of the ship.\n\nBeyond cost savings, safety has emerged as another key driver behind digitisation and automation. For instance, drones can inspect ship hulls to reduce safety hazards.\n\nThose who support the use of automation and technology argued at SMW 2016 that this is the way to go to draw more young talent into the sector. The consensus is that youth entering the job market have the capacity to handle what will be demanded in the digital evolution of Singapore's maritime sector of the future; software programming has already been introduced into the curriculum in Singapore secondary schools to make the young future-ready, an SMW speaker noted.\n\nBut automation has attracted complaints about manpower redundancy, although this is a bigger threat to those already in the trade. A panellist said, however, that incumbents would be given time to adjust to changes in work scope, on the assumption that digitisation and automation are rolled out in phases.\n\nGoing smart has to be a priority for maritime players if they want to strive to stay relevant through to 2030 and beyond. The sector will not stay low for too long.\n\nIf the results from a poll at SML 2016 are anything to go by, the beleaguered dry-bulk sub-sector may take the lead in the road to recovery.\n\nVia Mar chairman Robert Stenvik, speaking at an event organised by accounting firm Moore Stephens, said he expects the sub-sector to benefit from a general increase in China's total seaborne dry-bulk trade and significant fleet rationalisation, which will be a boon to all vessel types in the market. It remains to be seen whether the dry-bulk sub-sector would indeed lead the pack in the march to a smarter future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Ebrahim details his life in a memoir titled The Terrorist's Son.\n\nHe was only 10 years old when the bombing took place, and his father would later be convicted as one of the conspirators in the plot. And he was only seven when his father, El Sayyid Nosair, assassinated Meir Kahane, the militant ultra-Orthodox, anti-Arab rabbi who founded the Jewish Defense League in 1990.\n\nMr Ebrahim's father grew up in Egypt and moved to the US in 1981, and Mr Ebrahim was born two years later in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe recalls meeting Omar Abdel- Rahman, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing who was also known as \"The Blind Sheik\", when he preached at a mosque in Jersey City.\n\n\"Even though he spoke in Arabic you could see very clearly the emotion on his face and in the way he spoke. He spoke with this very passionate anger,\" Mr Ebrahim tells the audience during a keynote address at the Credit Suisse Global Megatrends Conference 2016.\n\nFearing for their lives, he and his family moved almost 20 times around the US while he was in his teens. Indeed, upon hearing the truth about Mr Ebrahim's father, one of his co-workers swung a knife at him, saying that \"he would be doing this country a favour if he killed me\".\n\n\"It was very important for me to show people that my experience was unique, even among Muslims. The vast majority of Muslims in the world are never indoctrinated into this level of extremism,\" he says.\n\nHe spent much of his life trying to understand what drew his father to terrorism, but it wasn't until he was in his 20s that he understood who his father really was and how his actions had affected his own life.\n\nHe says: \"I started to realise that I maybe didn't know my father at all.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

GOP lawmakers who tended to call for higher defence budgets faced opposition from Democrats, who demanded that more US dollars be spent on domestic social programmes.\n\nAnd when the Soviets during the Cold War or the many global Bad Guys that challenged the United States in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall were threatening America, Republicans would instinctively demand that Washington act tough against them, including by using its military power.\n\nThe Democrats, on the other hand, contended that military power should be applied as a last resort, only after all the diplomatic means have been exhausted.\n\nSo it wasn't surprising that many Democrats and liberals opposed the decisions by Republican presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush to go to war in Iraq and that Republicans used every opportunity to bash Democrats and liberals, including President Barack Obama, as \"weak\" on national security and accused them of \"appeasing\" America's enemies.\n\nThe political bottom line was that when Americans were worried about threats to the national security, they were more inclined to vote for Republican presidential candidates, and that when they were concerned that presidents was dragging the country into costly military quagmires, they would give their support to the Democrats.\n\nBut now it seems that the old political axiom would have to be reassessed.\n\nIf anything, the major foreign-policy address that Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump delivered on Wednesday in Washington suggests that when it comes to the use of American military force, Republicans and Democrats may be about to switch places, with the Donald more restrained about the use of military force than the hawkish Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile it would probably be a mistake to describe Mr Trump's speech, delivered under the auspices of TheNational Interest magazine, as the Trump Doctrine, it nevertheless amounted to a powerful rebuke of the GOP foreign-policy orthodoxy. In fact, it could be seen as a major challenge to the entire global strategy, including national security and trade policies, adopted by the Washington establishment after the end of the Cold War and that sometimes is referred to as \"globalism\".\n\nInsisting that as US president, he would \"no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism\" and stressing that \"the nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony\", the Republican frontrunner delivered what could be described as a cry of defiance vis-\u00e0-vis the entire way of thinking espoused by the foreign-policy elites, including leading editorial pages and think tanks. This thinking has been driving the policies of Republican and Democratic presidents in the form of military over-extension around the world and, in particular, in the Middle East, and the numerous free-trade deals that result in \"the theft of American jobs\", as Mr Trump put it.\n\nRecalling his earlier opposition to the decision to invade Iraq and to oust Saddam Hussein from power and establish a democracy in Iraq, Mr Trump ridiculed the \"dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy\" and blasted the US military intervention in the Middle East that \"helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper\".\n\n\"We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of American lives and many trillions of dollars were lost as a result,\" he said. \"The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their unjust enrichment.\"\n\nThe Donald pledged in his address that he would not only reverse US policies in the Middle East that resulted in the over-extension of US military power and financial resources, but would also put pressure on US allies in Europe and Asia who seem to expect the United States to pay the costs of protecting them. They need to \"contribute toward the financial, political and human costs of our tremendous security burden\" or else his administration would have no choice but to reassess its security commitments to them, Mr Trump asserted.\n\nUnlike \"other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct\", he declared, adding that one cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy and that a superpower \"understands that caution and restraint are signs of strength\". Under a Trump administration, \"the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies\".\n\nIt would be wrong to label President Trump's foreign policy as \"dovish\". In fact, in his address, he vowed to \"spend what we need to rebuild our military\" and to use all the necessary US military power to destroy ISIS. What he was suggesting was that he would make decisions on war and peace as well as on other global policy issues like trade, based solely on US national interest - or, to put it in simpler terms, President Trump would be more of a nationalist than an internationalist. He wouldn't go to war in the name of promoting liberal democracy or do nation building or sign trade deals as part of an effort to liberalise global trade; he would do all this only in order to advance US strategic and economic interests. This also explains his willingness to make deals with Russia and China that work for the United States instead of pressing those global powers to improve their human-rights policies.\n\n\"America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration,\" the Republican presidential frontrunner said, stressing that his foreign policy would \"always put the interests of the American people and American security first\".\n\nAnd that nationalist posture sets his foreign-policy agenda apart from the one that would be embraced by Mrs Clinton, who will remain committed to American traditional internationalist policy, including in its most recent incarnation, globalism.\n\nIn a way, Democratic presidential frontrunner Mrs Clinton has emerged as the most \"hawkish\" among the rest of the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. As a senator from New York, she voted in favour of giving President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq, a decision that she now apparently regrets.\n\nBut then as Secretary of State, she pushed for using US military power to remove Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi from power and help transform the country into a liberal democracy, a project that - like in the case of Iraq - had failed miserably. She also sided with the hawks in the Obama administration who urged the president to provide more military support to the anti-government insurgents in Syria and would probably adopt such policies if elected as president.\n\nIt is true that under pressure from the progressive wing of her party, she did distance herself from the pro-free-trade policies pursued by her husband in the 1990s. But the expectation in Washington is that as president, she would revert to those policies.\n\nThe foreign-policy elites in Washington are hoping that their globalist agenda would remain alive and well if she is elected president and takes new steps aimed at remaking the Middle East, even if that includes the use of military power while promoting nation building, democracy and free trade.\n\nThe Donald, on the other hand, is confident that Americans, exhausted of military interventions and opposed to trade agreement, would be drawn to his nationalist messages.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He was speaking at the recent Credit Suisse Global Megatrends Conference 2016.\n\nHe cites the example of Kaodim, a Malaysian company that his firm has funded, which provides an online marketplace for traditional services such as cleaning, construction and gardening.\n\nHe notes that South-east Asia is home to the world's largest youth population, with many among them already using mobile phones even before the Internet became pervasive.\n\nCombine the easy access to cheaper and more powerful mobile phones with more varied financing options and the opportunities to market to consumers through these digital devices become enormous.\n\n\"In Indonesia, in a small second or third-tier town, a person is able to pay for a cheap smartphone in instalments,\" says Mr Ramawy, who is also the vice-chairman of Mataharimall.com, one of the leading online marketplaces in Indonesia.\n\nMobile operators in Indonesia are also racing to build high-speed mobile networks. Coverage of the latest 4G networks in the country stands at around 30 per cent, but this is expected to double in a few years.\n\n\"These factors fuel the democratisation of technology to the masses in Indonesia via the mobile ecosystem. It is putting supercomputers very cheaply and accessibly in the hands of the masses,\" Mr Ramawy says.\n\nAll these developments are taking place even as many countries in South-east Asia struggle with inefficiencies in many aspects of their economy - from the distribution of goods and services and transportation to the matching of demand and supply.\n\n\"We are growing at a time when there are a lot of pain points that technology can solve. Herein lies the opportunity,\" says Mr Ramawy.\n\n\"So there is this interesting trend of traditional companies embracing technology. All this is possible because there is significant growth in terms of the number of tech startup founders who are local to their markets and who have lived through the pain points and know exactly what problems technology can solve.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They added that regulators also got involved.\n\nSpeculation is rife that after the report comes out, directors including Mr Tay may decide to leave the board ahead of the company's annual general meeting (AGM) in July. Mr Tay said in early April that he plans to not seek re-election at the AGM. He has also stepped down from the post of nominating committee chairman.\n\nThe SingPost counter dived 4.5 per cent or 7.5 Singapore cents to S$1.61 on Monday and has hovered around that level since. It closed at that price on Thursday, half a cent up from the previous day.\n\nSingPost's special audit is being conducted by law firm Drew & Napier and consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). Mr Tay had proposed the special audit in December last year and the board tapped PwC as special auditor about four weeks later in late January. But after public pressure over PwC's role as SingPost's longstanding external auditor, the board brought in Drew & Napier as joint special auditor in early February and said that the joint special audit would be completed in March.\n\nAt the end of March, however, SingPost said that it expected to release a summary of the audit findings in April. And as at Thursday evening, there was still no sign of the special audit summary.\n\n\"We understand that the auditors are close to completing the report,\" SingPost spokesman Peter Heng told The Business Times on Tuesday. When asked what had held up the report, he would only say: \"This is the result of the thorough and independent investigation that the joint auditors have undertaken.\"\n\nHe added that SingPost was sticking to its decision to release only a summary of the special audit findings to shareholders, rather than the full report. \"Our position to issue a summary of the special audit for our shareholders and other stakeholders remains. The full report will be submitted to the regulatory authorities.\"\n\nMr Heng said over the phone on Thursday that SingPost's Tuesday statement still held.\n\nSingPost shareholder and corporate governance specialist Mak Yuen Teen told BT: \"While I would like a thorough special audit rather than a speedy one, it's well overdue now. Such a delay may lead to speculation about the findings and whether there is pressure to redact the special audit report.\"\n\nSources said that the special audit findings were taking some time to be completed partly due to a drawn-out to-and-fro between the special auditors and board members including Mr Tay, who is at the centre of SingPost's corporate governance maelstrom.\n\nMr Tay was given at least three opportunities for Maxwellisation rather than the typical one shot, sources said. Maxwellisation is a legal term that refers to the process of presenting critical references in a probe to the criticised parties to give them the chance to reply.\n\nThe board has also needed time to formulate its response to the special audit findings, the completion which might be followed by board changes, sources added.\n\nSingPost's corporate governance issues centre on Mr Tay's interest in the group's acquisition of stakes in three companies. SingPost admitted last December that it had failed to properly disclose Mr Tay's interest in a 2014 acquisition.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year with American Express Co.\n\nThe latest partnership extends the service to ANZ customers and represents the culmination of months of talks with the bank and three bigger peers. Of the four, ANZ and Westpac Banking Corp have already agreed to support rival Android Pay from Alphabet Inc unit Google.\n\nCollectively, the four banks account for 80 per cent of all credit cards that consumers have linked to mobile payment systems, in a country with a relatively high rate of contactless payment.\n\nThe partnership also coincides with Apple's first-ever drop in iPhone sales during a quarter in which services such as apps, music and payment emerged as the firm's second largest business. \"Our customers ... are much closer to being able to leave their wallets at home,\" Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said.\n\nApple has partnered with a bank widely seen as trailing its three bigger peers in digital technology, a situation ANZ's new chief executive Shayne Elliott has set out to change with Apple Pay, as well as by hiring Google's Australia managing director.\n\n\"It would be pretty hypocritical of me to ... do all this hoo-ha about digital banking and then not be at the forefront of change,\" Mr Elliott said.\n\nShares of ANZ rose over 0.5 per cent early on Thursday, more than other banks as well as the broader market.\n\nFor Apple, the partnership is a \"coup\" as it would increase pressure on other banks to follow suit, said Foad Fadaghi, managing director of technology researcher Telsyte. \"The similar forces that drove other numerous banking corporations in, say, the US or Europe to get onboard will probably start to kick in in Australia as well,\" he said.\n\nAnalyst David Ellis at Morningstar said one partnership does not automatically entail success because the big four banks have such dominance over payment systems.\n\n\"It's a different market here in Australia from the US and other global economies ... but who knows,\" he said. \"iPhones have the highest market share in Australia of smartphones, so the banks won't want their customers being put at any disadvantage to competitors within their peer group.\" REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Each pass to the semi-final matches costs S$1,250, and those to the grand final on Oct 30, S$2,000 each.\n\nFans with these tickets get a premium baseline seat at the Singapore Indoor Stadium match venue, a buffet meal in a private pavilion before the action starts, access to the exclusive Aces Lounge for free-flow champagne and the chance to meet some players in the flesh, among many other perks.\n\nSarah Clements, the vice-president of tennis in Asia at event promoter Lagardere Sports, said: \"The Racquet Club is the premier hospitality programme for businesses large and small to network, mingle and host.\"\n\nThe WTA Finals, the season finale of the women's tennis tour, will once again be held at the Singapore Sports Hub in Kallang. From Oct 23, the top eight female singles players and doubles teams will compete for a share of the US$7 million prize purse.\n\nThe public may purchase special packages from May 6, organisers said on Thursday. Cardmembers of OCBC (the official card partner) and customers of Starhub (the official telecommunications and broadcast partner) can get theirs during a pre-sale from April 29 to May 5, during which they will enjoy discounts or cash rebates.\n\nAmong the many packages available is the Family Day promotion, where two adults and two children under the age of 16 pay half the usual price to watch the opening session of the tournament on Oct 23.\n\nFans who want regular tickets only to single sessions will have to wait until July 15 to get them. OCBC customers may start buying theirs from June 30 and StarHub customers, from July 8.\n\nAs was the case for the first two editions of the WTA Finals in Singapore in 2014 and 2015, prices for a single session will start at S$16.90; the most expensive regular ticket - a premium seat to watch the final - costs S$225.90, the same as last year.\n\nThe format for this year's WTA Finals is slightly different.\n\nThe first four days will feature only singles matches, which means fans are guaranteed to catch all eight singles players over the first two match sessions.\n\nThe popular doubles event, meanwhile, starts on the fifth day of the tournament on Oct 27, with eight teams slugging it out in a knockout format.\n\nSingapore has a contract to host the WTA Finals for five years until 2018. Last year's tournament was won by Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, who is the current world No 2 player, behind American Serena Williams.\n\nThe 27-year-old Radwanska defeated Czech Republic star Petra Kvitova in three sets in front of nearly 10,000 spectators at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, and a worldwide television audience of millions more.\n\nWilliams is now fourth on the \"Road to Singapore\" leaderboard, behind the top three of Angelique Kerber, Victoria Azarenka and Radwanska. The others in the current top eight are Carla Suarez-Navarro, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Johanna Konta and Roberta Vinci.\n\nMore information on tickets can be found at\n\nwtafinals.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Going forward we need to reverse this and generate superior returns out of our franchise,\" McFarlane said, in his first AGM statement as chairman. \"However it is worth remembering that we are in the process of turning around what was recently the largest bank in the world by assets,\" he added.\n\nChief Executive Jes Staley also took time to explain a decision to sacrifice part of the dividend to fund the revamp, but said the short-term pain was necessary to put Barclays in a position to grow payouts over time. \"Investing substantially in this company was one of the first things I did upon being appointed - and my interests are firmly aligned with yours,\" he said. \"However, I believe it is better to move quickly and decisively to eliminate the drag in this business now than to accept high levels of attrition on your returns for a much longer time than is necessary.\" Staley also said the bank was working hard to relieve the pressure on returns from fines for past conduct failings and was seeking to resolve outstanding issues \"as swiftly as possible\".\n\n\"There will also be no let-up in the critically important work to transform Barclays' culture,\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

This will be in addition to the 28 flights per week that also serve Perth, Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nAnother three flights between Singapore and Perth will start on Aug 19.

These made 2015 the best performing calendar year in Qantas's 95-year history.\n\nThe carrier has already ordered eight 787-9 Dreamliner jets, and plans to use them to replace its ageing 747s.\n\nMr Evans said they are also suitable for long-haul, non-stop flights, with Perth-London and Melbourne-Dallas as examples of such trips.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The town councils are responsible for implementing the NRPs, from start to finish,\" the PAP said.\n\nThis means that the town councils are responsible for \"prioritising needs within all the estates under their charge, developing detailed plans in consultation with residents, awarding tenders responsibly, overseeing the contractors and finally ensuring maintenance of estate enhancements\".\n\nLast Sunday, Dr Chee's by-election opponent, the PAP's Murali Pillai, announced a S$1.9 million NRP for 10 blocks of flats in Bukit Batok, one of his many plans that he wants to help carry out by becoming the ward's MP.\n\nHe told reporters then: \"If we don't have the mandate, then we don't have the ability to carry on, because we wouldn't form the town council. That's the rules.\"\n\nThat drew a sharp rebuke from the SDP, which insisted that government agencies were non-partisan and would work with whomever was eventually elected as Bukit Batok's MP.\n\nThe SDP also suggested that what Mr Murali had said was unethical and could be in breach of the Parliamentary Elections Act. The PAP fired back by saying that the SDP's claims were both misconceived and absurd.\n\nDr Chee, who also claimed that Mr Murali's upgrading proposals were \"knee-jerk reactions\" by the PAP each time an election comes around, said that it was the government's duty to support whichever MP was in charge of the town council.\n\n\"Bukit Batok residents can rest assured that we will continue to push through the plans that are already in place. For those in the pipeline, we want to consult more,\" he said.\n\nBukit Batok is one of seven wards under the PAP-run Jurong-Clementi Town Council. If Dr Chee wins the by-election, the SDP will run its own town council to serve Bukit Batok's population of about 46,000 people.\n\nIn its statement, the PAP stressed that the Jurong-Clementi Town Council - chaired by Jurong MP Ang Wei Neng - takes all its responsibilities very seriously.\n\n\"As the SDP says it will run an exemplary town council, voters will have to judge if it understands its responsibilities and can carry them out efficiently,\" the PAP said.\n\nMeanwhile, the two candidates will hold their first rallies of the campaign on Friday evening from 7pm to 10pm. The PAP has booked the Bukit Gombak Stadium, while the SDP will use the field along Bukit Batok Industrial Park A.\n\nBesides Mr Murali, those expected to appear at the PAP rally include Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob and Culture, Community and Youth Minister Grace Fu.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gross profit margin fell to 24 per cent from 26 per cent. \"Shipbuilding business registered a decline of 13 per cent in its revenue contribution to 2 billion yuan as even though more vessels were delivered in 1Q2016 (15 vessels) as compared to 1Q2015 (10 vessels), vessels delivered were of relatively smaller sizes,\" said Yangzijiang.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This month, the company repeated the feat even more impressively, setting the booster down on a floating platform in the Atlantic.\n\nNow SpaceX, Elon Musk's rocket company, has its sights set farther away: it aims to land one of its capsules on the surface of Mars in May 2018, the company announced in a Twitter message on Wednesday.\n\nMr Musk has said that SpaceX's long-term goal is to colonise Mars, and he has talked of an ambitious schedule to get people there in the mid-2020s.\n\nBut before that happens, Mr Musk (not to mention any would-be colonists) have to make sure that the technology for getting to Mars in one piece actually works.\n\nIn an announcement on Wednesday, SpaceX said it planned to send an unmanned Dragon capsule to Mars in 2018 and land it on the surface about six months later. (Mars and Earth line up only once every 26 months.) NASA also plans to send people to Mars, although not as quickly, aiming for the mid-2030s.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a couple of hours after the SpaceX Twitter message, Dava J Newman, NASA's deputy administrator, wrote: \"We are closer than ever before to sending American astronauts to Mars than anyone, anywhere, at any time has ever been. A new consensus is emerging around NASA's plan and timetable for sending astronauts to the Red Planet in the 2030s.\" NASA has emphasised that - unlike the Apollo missions to the moon - it is not working alone, but is enlisting the help of other countries and endeavours.\n\nAlmost in passing, Ms Newman mentioned the SpaceX Mars effort.\n\n\"Among the many exciting things we're doing with American businesses, we're particularly excited about an upcoming SpaceX project that would build upon a current 'no exchange of funds' agreement we have with the company,\" she wrote. \"In exchange for Martian entry, descent and landing data from SpaceX, NASA will offer technical support for the firm's plan to attempt to land an uncrewed Dragon 2 spacecraft on Mars.\"\n\nLanding on Mars is tricky. The atmosphere is thick enough that the energy of the arriving spacecraft slamming into the air molecules heats its outside to thousands of degrees, but it is too thin for parachutes to provide a gentle landing. NASA has turned to innovative devices like air bags, used to cushion the landings of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004, and a Rube Goldberg-esque \"sky crane\" system to set down the larger and heavier Curiosity rover in 2012.\n\nA team at NASA's Ames Research Center in California proposed SpaceX's Dragon capsule as a cheaper way to land on Mars, using rocket engines. SpaceX liked the idea enough to start working on it as well, signing an agreement to tap into NASA expertise.\n\nThe Dragon capsule would be launched on SpaceX's larger Falcon Heavy rocket, which has yet to have its first flight. \"These missions will help demonstrate the technologies needed to land large payloads propulsively on Mars,\" said Philip Larson, a SpaceX spokesman.\n\nBut even with SpaceX's recent technological tours de force, getting to Mars in 2018 would be a huge, quick leap for a company that has yet to leave Earth's neighbourhood.

He sold two drug companies, making enough to become a billionaire and buy a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team. Now Mr Soon-Shiong can also add this distinction to his resume: the highest-paid US executive of 2015.\n\nThe 63-year-old physician received a US$329.7 million pay package last year as chief executive officer of NantKwest Inc, a cancer-research firm that went public last July and has a market value of US$715.5 million.\n\nThat sum vaults him to the No 1 spot on the Bloomberg Pay Index, a ranking of the top-paid executives at companies that trade on US exchanges. Most of his pay stems from 19.4 million stock options granted before the initial public offering.\n\nDealmaker Paul J Taubman is No 2 on the list with US$164 million in awarded pay, after merging his boutique bank with the advisory businesses of Blackstone Group LP and spinning off the combined business, PJT Partners Inc, in October.\n\nHe's followed by Google Inc CEO Sundar Pichai who received US$151.9 million as he was tapped to run the search-engine unit of parent Alphabet Inc.\n\n\"You pay the Michael Jordans more because they're the Michael Jordans,\" said David Hofrichter, a senior partner at Aon Hewitt's executive compensation and governance practice.\n\nMr Soon-Shiong paid US$47 million in December 2014 for a 31 per cent stake in NantKwest, which researches treatments that use the human immune system to fight tumors. Three months later, he was named chairman and CEO.\n\nMost of his options have strike prices of about US$2, according to a regulatory filing from the San Diego-based company.\n\nNantKwest closed at US$8.73 on Wednesday, down 50 per cent since year-end. Some of the options are tied to reaching goals, while the remainder vest through March 2019.\n\nHis 2015 pay also included 600,000 restricted shares, a US$386,301 cash bonus and US$1 in salary.\n\nMr Soon-Shiong is the world's 116th-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThat's thanks in part to selling APP Pharmaceuticals Inc, which he founded, in 2008 and Abraxis BioScience Inc in 2010.\n\nMichael Sitrick, a spokesman for Mr Soon-Shiong and NantKwest, declined to comment on his compensation.\n\nMr Soon-Shiong's pay package tops that of last year's highest-paid executive: GoPro Inc's Nick Woodman, whose big payday also came through an IPO.\n\nMr Woodman received restricted shares worth US$285 million prior to the San Mateo, California-based camera-maker's debut on public exchanges. The value of the shares has since collapsed.\n\nIn 2013, Cheniere Energy Inc CEO Charif Souki came in first with US$281 million. He sold US$216 million of stock before being ousted from his role in December by activist investor Carl Icahn.\n\nThe Bloomberg Pay Index tracks the 200 highest-paid executives who appear in the filings of companies that submit proxy statements to US regulators.\n\nAwarded pay, with equity grants valued at each company's fiscal year-end, can differ from what's reported in proxy filings.\n\nNantKwest's proxy filing on Wednesday disclosed pay of US$147.6 million for Mr Soon-Shiong in 2015, mostly in options that were priced before the company's public offering. They were worth more than double the reported value by its 2015 fiscal year-end, according to the index.\n\nMr Taubman, a former executive at Morgan Stanley and one of the world's most successful mergers-and-acquisitions advisers, received most of his compensation in exchange for his ownership interest in PJT's predecessor firm.\n\nAbout half comes from a stock award that pays out only if he can reach stock targets by 2021: PJT's chairman and CEO would receive one-fifth of the award if the price more than doubles to US$48 and all of the 3.05 million units if it more than triples to US$79. PJT closed Wednesday at US$22.36.\n\nOther than a US$250,000 salary, the rest of Mr Taubman's compensation is in the form of 2.75 million stock units that vest through 2019, regardless of the investment bank's performance.\n\nMr Pichai's compensation consists mostly of restricted stock he received in January 2015 for his performance and increased responsibilities as the leader of Google's technical product areas. That award grew to US$151.2 million by the company's fiscal year-end.\n\nThe former deputy to Google co-founder Larry Page has a good chance of remaining near the top of the Bloomberg Pay Index for 2016, thanks to a US$199 million grant of restricted shares he received in February. That was the largest award ever given to a Google executive whose pay has been reported in filings.\n\nAlphabet Inc, the holding company that owns Google, typically grants equity to bosses once every two years. The index allocates half of Mr Pichai's February award for 2016, and the other half for 2017.\n\nJoe Kiani, the founder of medical device maker Masimo Corp, is No 4 with US$121.8 million. He was granted US$112 million in stock that will pay out if he is terminated before 2018.\n\nThe award was exchanged for benefits in Mr Kiani's employment contract - including guaranteed annual grants of options and a golden parachute - after three years of negotiations. His pay doesn't include a US$35 million cash award that would also be granted in an acquisition.\n\nPayout of the awards isn't probable, the company said.

Its online platform recommends snacks based on the user's taste and dietary preferences.\n\nSaid co-founder Walter Oh: \"We founded BoxGreen because we realised consumers here in South-east Asia are huge on snacking. But when it comes to healthier snacking, there are limited choices available.\"\n\nBoxGreen's vision is to use technology to make snacking fun, easy and nutritious for people in major Asian cities, it said.\n\nSince May 2015, BoxGreen has delivered over 75,000 nutritious sealed single-serve snack packs to its over 2,000 members. It now boasts more than 30 snack varieties comprising all-natural mixes of granola, dried fruits and baked nuts.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In particular, traffic to and from China, Malaysia and Thailand enjoyed double-digit growth.\n\nThis comes as a turnaround in the second half of last year spills over into 2016. In comparison, it was a tale of two halves with flat growth in the first half of 2015 after several high-profile air accidents in 2014 dampened travel demand and as carriers cut capacity amid sliding yields.\n\nLast year, Changi saw a record 55.4 million passengers pass through the airport.\n\n\"An improvement in global economic activity, stable oil prices and the delivery of longer range aircraft will present new growth opportunities for the industry,\" said the chief executive officer of airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG), Lee Seow Hiang. \"In the coming months, we look forward to the launch of Singapore Airlines' new services to Dusseldorf, Canberra and Wellington.

The economy grew at a 1.4 per cent pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlmost all sectors of the economy weakened in the first quarter, with the housing market the lone star.\n\nThe slowdown in growth is likely temporary, given a fairly robust jobs market. Applications for unemployment benefits are near a 43-year low and employment gains averaged 209,000 jobs per month in the first quarter.\n\nIn addition the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys, which are closely correlated to economic activity, have rebounded in recent months.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged economic activity had \"slowed,\" it also said labour market conditions had \"improved further.\" The US central bank appeared to view the threats from the global economy and financial markets as having diminished.\n\nThe Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further. It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nEconomists also say the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite recent steps to address the problem.\n\nResidual seasonality has plagued first-quarter GDP, with growth underperforming in five of the last six years since the recovery started in June 2009.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased at a 1.9 per cent rate. That was the slowest since the first quarter of 2015 and was a deceleration from the fourth quarter's 2.4 per cent rate.\n\nHouseholds have been frugal, cutting back on purchases of automobiles, despite cheap gasoline. Households appear to have socked away modest wage gains from the tightening labour market and the gasoline savings. They have also reduced their debt.\n\nIncome at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation increased 2.9 per cent in the first quarter after rising 2.3 per cent in the prior period. Savings rose to a lofty US$712.3 billion from US$678.3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nHigher savings and a lower debt load augur well for an acceleration in consumer spending.\n\nTepid consumer spending gave businesses more reason to place fewer orders for goods and ramp up efforts to reduce an inventory bloat. In the first quarter, businesses accumulated US$60.9 billion worth of inventory, down from US$78.3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe small inventory build cut 0.33 percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth, up from the 0.22 percentage point drag in the fourth quarter.\n\nTrade subtracted 0.34 percentage point from GDP growth, with dollar strength weighing on exports and sucking in imports. The dollar gained 20 per cent versus the currencies of the United States' trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015.\n\nSo far this year the dollar is down 2.6 per cent on a trade weighted basis, raising optimism for a rebound in exports.\n\nA sustained plunge in energy sector investment put more pressure on business spending. Investment in equipment tumbled at a 8.6 per cent rate, the steepest decline since the second quarter of 2009.\n\nSpending on non-residential structures dropped at a 10.7 per cent pace as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts collapsed at a record 86 per cent rate. Investment in mining exploration contracted at a 39.6 per cent rate in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere were strong gains in residential investment in the first quarter, the only bright spot in the economy.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Faced with this triple whammy, the Straits Times Index (STI), which on Thursday first made a spirited attempt at avoiding a fifth consecutive loss when it initially rallied 26 points to an intraday high of 2,900, saw its advance abruptly halted in the late morning. It eventually ended the day a net 12.42 points weaker at 2,862.30.\n\nTurnover was average at 1.4 billion units worth S$1.06 billion and excluding warrants there were 186 rises versus 206 falls.\n\nThere is some hope, however, that conditions may improve on Friday if funds indulge in a spot of month-ending window dressing.\n\nOver in Japan, the BOJ's unexpected move was said to have been because the central bank wanted more time to study the impact of negative interest rates it implemented just three months ago.\n\nBank of Singapore's chief economist Richard Jerram in his \"Caution from Fed, confusion from BoJ'' said it was never clear why the BOJ saw the need to move to negative rates in late January and, conversely, why it is unnecessary to act now.\n\n\"The BOJ appears to have miscalculated in allowing market expectations for more negative rates or ETF purchases to build, but then delivering no policy change. There is not much predictability to what they will do next,\" said Mr Jerram.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The group is expected to incur higher operating expenses attributable to the intensive maintenance and renewal programmes of the ageing network,\" said SMRT.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are the steepest quarterly falls since prices and rentals started softening in 2014. It is also the result of the government's continued supply-side efforts and anti-speculative measures, in its bid to bring down rentals which had surged about 48 per cent from mid-2009 to 2013.\n\nJTC said this period of economic slowdown and uncertainty presents an opportunity for industrialists to re-look their operations and processes - which may result in process re-engineering, streamlining and even outsourcing of non-core activities.\n\n\"All these will have impact on space needs. Companies can move from land to space (meaning from landed factories to high-rise factories), or tap on shared facilities to lower capital expenditure and reduce operating costs. It will not only lower business costs, but allow companies to stay nimble and flexible and be ready for the next economic upturn,\" it said.\n\nJohn Kong, council member of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation and managing director of steelmaker M Metal, said the rental falls and wide array of leasing options available today are good for new industrialists looking to set up a new place.\n\nBut existing industrialists in the midst of serving a lease are unlikely to relocate or expand, given uncertainties in the business environment.\n\n\"The Singapore economy is at a transition. Businesses are not doing well. Everyone is putting expansion plans on hold; no one knows what is going to happen to me in six to nine months' time. Where will my orders come from? . . . I would rather say, 'hang on, let me wait another six months, see whether the economy picks up', then make a decision. I wouldn't take on more than I can chew,\" he said.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is not in good shape. Labour statistics released on Thursday show manufacturing employment continuing to fall (-2,000) for the sixth straight quarter. Headline industrial production contracted one per cent y-o-y in Q1, according to economists' calculations.\n\nQ1's industrial rent declines were broad-based, with multiple-user factories taking the lead, posting a 7 per cent y-o-y fall. The sub-sector did so poorly that multi-user space completed in 2015 locked in an occupancy rate of only 32.1 per cent at end-March 2016, while those completed in Q1 are only 0.4 per cent occupied.\n\nEven the business park segment - oft expected to remain in demand because of its limited supply and links to high productivity and value-add economic clusters - was not spared from the haemorrhage.\n\nRents fell 2.5 per cent y-o-y. Both prices and rentals are expected to fall further, with a huge supply coming onstream. This year and next, about 4.2 million square metres (sq m) of industrial space is estimated to come onstream. This far exceeds the average annual supply and demand of industrial space of around 1.8 million sq m and 1.2 million sq m in the past three years. Occupancies should fall as a result, JTC said.\n\nAsked if this may result in plenty of built-up industrial space left empty and unused, Tay Huey Ying, JLL's research head for Singapore, said no.\n\nThis is because a large percentage of the upcoming supply will be single-user build-to-suit factories, constructed by industrialists for their own use. They will thus probably be occupied, and that should mitigate a surge in vacancies.\n\n\"So yes, although occupancy rates will trend down, I don't think it will suddenly drop down to below 85 per cent. It will likely hover around 87-88 per cent,\" she said.\n\nAnthea To, senior associate director of research and advisory at Colliers, said with no firm signs of a turnaround in the performance of the manufacturing sector, cost containment is going to guide occupiers' real estate decisions in 2016. She expects industrial prices and rents to fall 7-10 per cent for the whole of 2016.\n\nDTZ regional head (South-east Asia) of research Lee Nai Jia expects industrial property prices to soften further, as firms try to stay asset light and also take advantage of the weaker rental rates.\n\nThe cheaper rents will in turn help them control their costs amid the uncertain economic climate, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), as an integral part of the national health system, has an important role to play in joining and supporting the government's efforts to tackle this growing problem as two in three cases of kidney failure are due to diabetes.\n\nOur nation ranks second worldwide for diabetes-induced kidney failure, accounting for 65 per cent of all kidney patients. Seven in 10 kidney patients have diabetes and/or hypertension, the leading causes of kidney failure. There is one new case of kidney failure every five hours and we are concerned that the situation would get worse due to the ageing population and increasing diabetic, hypertensive and obesity rates.\n\nThe key is prevention. While kidney failure cannot be reversed, diabetes and hypertension can be prevented or controlled, if diagnosed and treated early. Good food choices and nutrition, regular exercise, appropriate health checks and maintaining a healthy weight are effective lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of kidney diseases.\n\nNKF has been partnering the community to organise health education and awareness programmes such as health screenings, health talks and outreach events among others, year-round. Our Kidney Health Education Bus with interactive exhibits brings preventive health care to the doorsteps of schools, grassroots and religious organisations. To complement the Health Ministry's efforts, we also have our diabetes screening bus. Three more such buses will be added at a later stage.\n\nWe cannot agree more with the Health Ministry that it is important to work upstream to lay the foundations to lead healthier lives. Early education on kidney diseases and its related diseases such as diabetes should be instituted from young as more are getting diabetes at a younger age.\n\nWe are thankful for the collaboration with schools through our Schools Outreach Programme where students learn to care for their kidneys by adopting healthy lifestyles. Our upgraded Kidney Discovery Centre, to be completed at the end of this year, will enhance interactivity and engagement on kidney health learning, elevate the learning experience and imbue the importance of taking care of kidney health throughout one's lifetime.\n\nCompanies can do their part to encourage their employees to care for their well-being. Through programmes such as NKF's Healthy Mondays, companies engage their employees and motivate them to create a culture of wellness at the start of the week. We also encourage family members of patients to go for health screenings for early detection and intervention as they may be at higher risk of kidney diseases.\n\nNKF will continue to work closely with the Health Ministry, healthcare and social agencies and the media to bring across the message of healthy living to many more.\n\nEdmund Kwok Chief executive officer National Kidney Foundation\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Delta had said in December it would add up to 20 Embraer 190 and 20 new Boeing 737-900ER jets. Bombardier said separately on Thursday that the deal included an option for Delta to buy an additional 50 CS100 aircraft.\n\nFor Delta, the deal allows it to phase out 50-seat jets that it contracts regional airlines to fly under its Delta Connection brand.\n\nThe larger CS100 planes burn less fuel per passenger and have room for two cabin classes rather than one, giving it the opportunity to up-sell customers to business.\n\nThe Bombardier aircraft will also be flown by Delta's own pilots, reducing Delta's reliance on contractors as a shortage of regional pilots looms in the United States.\n\nBoeing beat out Bombardier to sell United Continental Holdings Inc 65 jets earlier this year. The planemaker is also studying whether to revise one version of its best-selling 737 jet to fend off the competition.\n\nSwiss International Air Lines, a unit of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, expects to take delivery of its first CS100 at the end of June, with the first flight, from Zurich to Paris Charles de Gaulle, scheduled for July 15.\n\nAir Canada has also signed a letter of intent to buy 45 CSeries, with an option for 30 more of the narrow-body aircraft.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/962a7e41d6daa36a362faa2232480549a2b79676e23ba06a589ac39a99af3193?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Delta Air Lines Inc on Thursday ordered 75 CSeries CS100 planes worth US$5.6 billion from Bombardier Inc, throwing a lifeline to a new aircraft program that is years late and billions of dollars over budget."}]}

Sales rose 6.2 per cent, excluding currency fluctuations, slightly ahead of the 5.8 per cent estimate. The stock gained as much as 2.7 per cent in Paris.\n\n\"The biggest and most profitable luxury-goods division saved the day,\" wrote Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"France was surprisingly resilient, which probably was driven by its loyal local clientele.\"\n\nHermes's Parisian stores are still suffering from the fallout of last year's terror attacks, as well as the recent bombings in Brussels, Chief Executive Officer Axel Dumas said on a call with reporters.\n\nWhile store visits in London and Milan are back to normal levels, Paris has yet to recover, he said, seeking to explain a 9.2 per cent drop in sales of silk scarves and ties.\n\nLeather-goods and saddlery revenue rose 15 per cent, beating the 12 per cent consensus. Hermes expanded leather production facilities in France last year, boosting supplies. The company's 15th leather workshop opened this month and investments in another are continuing, Hermes said.\n\nSales of every other major product line dropped.\n\nHermes has served fewer customers in the Middle East due to a drop in tourism and the plunging price of oil, Mr Dumas said. Sales fell in Macau, though they stabilized in Hong Kong, which remains weak, the CEO said. And Hermes's US retail sales trailed a 4.4 per cent gain in the Americas region, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of volatility,\" Mr Dumas said. \"We have to adapt to circumstance.\" Hermes warned last month that 2016 will be difficult. If that doesn't change and demand remains subdued in parts of Asia and the US, revenue growth could be below 8 per cent this year, excluding currency swings, Hermes reiterated on Thursday.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

Fortunately, explaining what went wrong with Airbus's first-quarter earnings isn't.\n\nThe European manufacturer has almost 957 billion euros (S$1.46 trillion) worth of planes in its order book. That counts for little if you can't actually deliver the aircraft to your customers on time. Airbus is struggling.\n\nEarnings per share slumped by half compared to a year ago amid a cornucopia of production problems spanning the A320neo narrow-body jet, the A350 wide-body and the A400M military transporter.\n\nThe company delivered nine fewer planes than the same quarter a year ago. That matters because customers pay most of the sticker price when aircraft are handed over. Airbus's working capital ballooned by 2.8 billion euros because aircraft are sitting unfinished at factories rather than pulling up at the departure gate.\n\nIn fairness, many problems lie with suppliers: for example, Pratt & Whitney's engines for the A320neo and Zodiac's cabin equipment for the A350. But customers tend not to be bothered about who's at fault. Airlines just want their planes and if they can't get them they'll consider taking their business elsewhere.\n\nAirbus had guided the market to expect a back-end loaded year in terms of deliveries and profit. Nobody was expecting the first quarter to be a knock-out. The decades-long development and production programs in commercial aircraft also make it inadvisable to draw too many conclusions from a single quarter.\n\nStill, the past three months were uniquely unpleasant for Airbus (\"challenging\" in the words of CEO Tom Enders.) Almost every key financial metric was worse. This makes its goal to deliver more than 650 aircraft in 2016 and achieve stable profit before special items seem ambitious, to say the least.\n\nAirbus warned the new propeller gearbox troubles on the A400m could have a \"significant\" financial impact, but it's not yet in a position to say how much, which is concerning.\n\nIn case that wasn't enough, Airbus commercial aircraft sales have hit turbulence too. Following several cancellations, it booked just 10 net orders during the quarter. The start of the year tends to be slow but in the same period a year ago Airbus took 101 orders.\n\nEven currency markets have turned hostile. A weaker euro made its planes more competitive versus Boeing but in the first quarter the currency gained more than 4 per cent versus the greenback.\n\nAirbus shares trade at a premium to Boeing's (17.2 versus 16.2 times estimated 2016 earnings), in part because of its success selling planes. After today, investors will reflect that sales performance no longer looks so assured and that, in any case, building aircraft is much more important than a signature and a handshake.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The legislation, which makes it easier to wind up a dying company or recover dues from a defaulter, could be passed in the current session of parliament that ends on May 13, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.\n\nThe bankruptcy code is key to fulfilling Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll promise of improving ease of doing business in India and revive the government's stalled reform agenda.\n\nWorld Bank data show that creditors in India recover about 25.7 US cents on the dollar in the 4.3 years it takes to resolve insolvency compared with 80.4 US cents in the US in less than half that time, which deters lending and investment.\n\n\"Given that many corporate transactions and businesses today involve an international and cross-border element, the implications of cross-border insolvency cannot be ignored for too long,\" the panel said in its report tabled in parliament.\n\nIt also wants Life Insurance Corp and Infrastructure Development Finance Company to be included in the list of lenders apart from banks.\n\nKingfisher Airlines, whose founder Vijay Mallya is now under pressure from authorities to return to India and pay 90 billion rupees (S$1.82 billion) of dues to banks, is the latest example of how the existing web of complex insolvency laws is affecting companies and lenders. Mr Mallya, who is now in London, has said he isn't a \"wilful defaulter\" and was making efforts \"in all sincerity\" to repay loans.\n\nThe legislation proposes an insolvency regulator, lays down the procedure for early identification of financial distress in companies, and prescribes time-lines for their revival or shutting down. Insolvency issues can be dealt with in as little as 90 days and a maximum of 270 days.\n\nAmong other measures to hasten recovery of bad loans, India is planning to change rules, allowing debt recovery tribunals to limit cases to two hearings and give a ruling within 30 days of the final hearing.\n\nMr Jaitley had introduced the legislation in December before it was referred to the parliamentary panel. Mr Modi, whose 2014 election win was cheered by investors looking for quick economic reform, has since back tracked on a key legislation aimed at making land acquisition easier while the national sales tax remains stuck in parliament due to a blockade by opposition parties.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

But business travel remained solid, including on routes to Europe, ANA said.\n\nJAL, meanwhile, said net profit jumped 17.1 per cent to 174.5 billion yen while operating profit rose 16.4 per cent to 209.2 billion yen.\n\nSales fell 0.6 per cent to 1.3 trillion yen.\n\nStrong corporate and inbound demand on North American, Chinese and Southeast Asian routes boosted international passenger services, JAL said.\n\nANA and JAL also enjoyed tailwinds from a strengthening yen, which lowers dollar-denominated fuel costs.\n\nBut going forward the trend of a stronger currency is risky as it could eventually discourage foreign visitors from coming to or spending more money in Japan, said Hasegawa, the analyst.\n\nA recent series of deadly earthquakes in Japan's southwest could also discourage prospective tourists, particularly those from China, he said.\n\nThe direction for aviation demand in China as its economy slows is a another factor to watch, he added.\n\nFor the year to March 2017, ANA forecast continued growth, with net profit projected at 80 billion yen, operating profit at 145 billion yen and sales of 1.81 trillion yen.\n\nJAL, meanwhile, expects its annual net profit to rise 10 per cent to 192 billion yen but sees operating profit falling 3.9 per cent to 201 billion yen. Sales are projected to grow by 0.5 per cent to 1.3 trillion yen.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

So with competition increasing between the highest- rated airlines in Asia and the Middle East, it's no surprise that their battalions of food trolleys are in the vanguard of the fight for premium passengers.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines introduced new food and beverage offerings as they try to lure back premium passengers from carriers such as Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways PJSC that offer shower spas and luxurious suites.\n\nThe Middle Eastern operators have used their geographic position at the crossroads of global flight paths to build giant transfer hubs that connect passengers between Asia and Europe and the US.\n\nAs the champagne corks pop, we take a look inside the galleys of five airlines to see how each is looking to appeal to the modern road warrior.\n\nSINGAPORE AIRLINES\n\nRated as the world's best business class by Skytrax last year, Singapore Airlines is targeting the health conscious traveler with new dishes in first and business class that are high on protein and essential minerals.\n\nThe so-called \"Deliciously Wholesome\" meals use fresh vegetables, lean meat, fish, seeds, herbs and spices that the airline claims help passengers feel less tired and jet-lagged after a long trip.\n\nUnder the carrier's Book the Cook service, you can order a meal online in advance from one of Singapore's panel of international chefs.\n\nThink spring salad bouquet of haricot vert beans, artichokes, asparagus and tomatoes with boiled eggs and roasted walnuts, designed by triple Michelin- starred Georges Blanc. But don't worry, there's still a Charolais steak with foie gras, white wine and truffle Perigueux sauce to be found if you're not so concerned about the jet lag.\n\nCATHAY PACIFIC\n\nHong Kong-based Cathay teamed up with Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group last year to design a menu for its first-class cabin and has been busy adding Chinese cuisines to lure mainland flyers. Try a seasonal winter melon soup, clay pot rice and hairy crab roe, for instance.\n\nThe 14 types of noodle soups are very popular in first and business classes, or for a trip into Hong Kong's colonial past, there's a tiered English cream tea, complete with scones and strawberry jam.\n\nCathay has also upped its game down in the cellar, hiring Debra Meiburg, one of five Masters of Wine based in Asia, to help sample beverages that go nicely a mile above the ground.\n\nEMIRATES\n\nSpeaking of wine, why start with the food and pair the wine when you can do it the other way round? Emirates introduced Dom Perignon vintages last year to first- and business-class with pairing menu of canapes that included cured duck with saffron poached peach and wild smoked salmon, lemon and cumin cream cheese on Norlander bread.\n\nThe airline also has delved into some of the best-known chateaux in Bordeaux for its wine selection.\n\nEmirates food menu has also taken the healthy tack, with offerings shunning the evil saturated fats and added sugars.\n\nFor those who want to socialize at 40,000 feet, premium class passengers on the A380 can head to the bar, graze on canapes and get the bartender to fix you a drink.\n\nETIHAD\n\nEtihad caused a stir with the introduction of its three- room luxury suite on its superjumbo called The Residence, which comes with a Savoy-trained butler, en-suite shower and private chef, earning the Skytrax award for the best first-class cabin.\n\nFor those slumming it back in business class, the situation is still far from dire. Half a dozen premium-class passengers can socialise or hold a meeting at the \"Lobby\" on the upper deck of the airline's A380 aircraft.\n\nEtihad has an all-day dining menu in addition to its a la carte options, rather like room service, so you can eat that steak sandwich whenever you like. Alternatively the airline's food and beverage manager will assist you in selecting dishes like Gulf lamb machboos, and there's always the classic Arabic mezze platter.\n\nWhile Etihad has gone large for its super-elite customers, it's gone small for the wine selection, choosing bottles from smaller, boutique vineyards, rather than big producers. Have a glass of Champagne Jacquart 'Mosaique'.\n\nQATAR AIRWAYS\n\nFor its business-class cabin, Qatar Airways signed up celebrity Michelin-starred chefs Nobu Matsuhisa and Vineet Bhatia, with a sample menu including a roasted mustard and dill salmon with dill pine nut rice as well as the necessary mezze selection.\n\nThe caviar starter is a particular favourite, but Qatar's silver bullet in its food offerings is storied French bakery Laduree, which has been churning out handcrafted pastries and macarons for more than a century. Chocolate torte, anyone?\n\nLike Emirates, Qatar also has its club in the sky on the A380. You can sip an Old Fashioned prepared by the on-board mixologist. Count von Zeppelin would have approved.\n\nInformation is taken from the airlines' statements and websites and sample menus. Offerings vary, depending on the type of plane and the route taken.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

New production issues are also afflicting the A400M transport plane.\n\nEarnings before interest and tax fell to 501 million euros (S$763.88 million), excluding one-time items, from 651 million euros a year earlier, the Toulouse, France-based company said in a statement. Analysts had forecast a profit of 473 million euros, the average of estimates collected by Bloomberg.\n\nAirbus's upgrade of the best-selling A320 has become a headache as engine supplier Pratt & Whitney grapples with an over-heating issue that led launch customer Qatar Airways Ltd to refuse delivery of the jets.\n\nThe A350 is behind schedule as suppliers of galleys and interior furnishings struggle to keep up.\n\nChief Executive Officer Tom Enders said the setbacks shouldn't affect Airbus's goal of delivering 650 aircraft this year, up from 635 in 2015, or its forecast for earnings at least matching last year's level.\n\n\"We expect a stable financial performance but deliveries, cash and earnings will be heavily loaded towards the end of the year,\" Mr Enders said. The company faces \"a serious challenge\" in production of its A400M military transport due to new and unexpected issues concerning the engine-propeller gearbox, he said.\n\nAirbus delivered four A350s in the first three months out of a total of 50 it aims to hand over this year, together with 103 A320s, down from 109 in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nWith Pratt promising an engine fix by mid-year, the company plans to accelerate Neo output in the second half and could also bring forward production of some older-version A320s to fill any gap. Sales rose 1 per cent in the quarter to 12.2 billion euros.\n\nNet income fell to 50 per cent to 399 million euros from 2014's figure of 792 million euros, which was swelled by a 697-million euro gain from the sale of a 17.5 per cent stake in Dassault Aviation SA.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The lower range covers the whole of South Korea and Japan, while the upper range would include US military bases on Guam.\n\nThe missile has never been successfully flight-tested.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

No Chinese foreign minister has visited Japan since Nov 2009.\n\nWhile Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe overcame disagreements over territory and history to meet in Nov 2014 and April of last year, the fragile rapprochement has since frayed.\n\nNeither side can afford to allow tensions to worsen, given a US$344 billion trade relationship, the lingering risk of a maritime clash over disputed islands close to Taiwan and the growing threat from North Korean missiles.\n\nA Japanese foreign ministry official, who declined to be identified in line with ministry policy, said the relationship is still very difficult. The official added that while Japan is keen for ties to improve, it is also the responsibility of China.\n\nJapan contacted China this month about sending Shotaro Yachi, a close Mr Abe aide, to Beijing in a bid to set up a summit this year, Kyodo News reported Thursday. The Japanese foreign ministry official denied that such an approach had been made.\n\nMr Xi and Mr Abe are both scheduled to attend a G-20 meeting in Hangzhou, China in September.\n\nTerritorial Dispute\n\nMr Abe and Mr Xi have not met bilaterally for more than a year. They missed their latest chance to sit down about a month ago at a nuclear security summit in Washington. A ministerial meeting on the economy planned for \"early\" this year also hasn't materialized, and there's been no announcement on Japan's scheduled hosting of a trilateral summit with South Korea and China this year.\n\nThe hiatus comes as Japan steps up its criticism of Beijing over its behavior in the South China Sea, where China has reclaimed more than 3,000 acres of land over the past two years as it builds a platform to assert its claims to more than 80 per cent of the water.\n\nChina, for its part, regularly warns against Japanese interference in the dispute and chides the Abe government for not doing more to deal with the legacy of the country's wartime past.\n\n\"Japan's wrong approach to history and other issues has in recent years dealt a body blow to Japan-China relations,\" China's foreign minister Wang Yi said last month.\n\n\"Thanks to the efforts of wise people on both sides there are signs of improvement in the Sino-Japanese relationship, but there is little ground for optimism.\"\n\nG-7 Statement\n\nChina was also riled by a statement issued in Hiroshima earlier this month by foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations in which they expressed concerns about the situation in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, where Japan and China dispute the sovereignty of a group of islets.\n\nChina regularly sends coast guard vessels into Japanese-administered waters around a group of disputed islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyutai in China, and Japan has backed US efforts to challenge China's claims in the South China Sea by sending warships near its outposts there.\n\n\"We express our strong opposition to any intimidating, coercive or provocative unilateral actions that could alter the status quo and increase tensions,\" the G-7 ministers said in reference to the two seas.\n\nChina responded by saying the G-7 should focus on economic issues and stay out of the disputes.\n\nAfter the trip to Beijing, Mr Kishida will spend the next week visiting Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.

Easing of tourist visa rules last year by the government for visitors from France, Italy, Spain, the UK and Germany is boosting traffic, according to Mr Minh.\n\nVietnam Air, which faces growing competition from low-cost carrier VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co, is positioning itself as a premium airline, targeting the country's new flying classes as well as foreign tourists, he said.\n\n\"The overall market share doesn't mean so much,\" Mr Minh said. \"Good margin is more important.

It was the first time the SFC had taken action against a credit-rating firm since it started regulating rating activities in June 2011.\n\nThe tribunal did not uphold all of the SFC's claims against Moody's, more than halving the regulator's proposed HK$23 million (S$4 million) fine to HK$11 million. It also directed the SFC to re-draft its public reprimand against the agency.\n\nOnly a handful of SFAT decisions have ever been appealed in the Hong Kong courts, according to lawyers. Moody's did not elaborate on the grounds for appeal, but appeals must typically make the case that the law was wrongly applied in the first instance, the lawyers said.\n\nOne of the arguments Moody's made in its defence was that the report did not constitute a credit rating and was therefore not subject to the SFC's jurisdiction, but the SFAT did not accept this.\n\nHong Kong investor and corporate governance activist David Webb in a blog last month said SFAT's ruling imposed \"deeply disturbing\" restrictions on free speech and set too high a threshold for accuracy in research reports.\n\nThe ruling \"will have a chilling effect on negative criticism of companies in Hong Kong,\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

But even so they have lost nearly half their market value or about US$3.7 billion on fears of hefty compensation costs and fines.\n\nIt has admitted to manipulating test data for four domestic mini-vehicle models, including two it produced for Nissan Motor Co and has said that more models may also be non-compliant with Japanese regulations.\n\nIt compiled data for fuel economy tests using US standards, where higher-speed, highway driving is common, rather than Japanese standards, where more prevalent city driving commonly consumes more fuel.\n\nMitsubishi's North American unit said in a statement that it had re-tested vehicles for the model years 2013 to 2017 and found that their fuel economy readings were accurate.\n\nWhile North America is one of Mitsubishi's smaller markets, accounting for roughly 13 per cent of the automaker's annual global sales, the potential for hefty fines and compensation if rules were broken is seen as much greater than in other countries.\n\nIn Japan, Mitsubishi may have to reimburse customers for fuel costs and the government for \"eco car\" tax breaks.\n\nIt is also taking a large hit to sales, saying this week that its domestic orders have halved since the scandal broke. The automaker has halted sales of the four affected mini-vehicles.\n\nJapan's transport ministry said on Thursday it plans tests to measure the fuel economy of vehicles made by Mitsubishi next week and will announce results on the first four models in June.\n\nIt has also set up a task force to examine fuel economy data submitted by all automakers.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Apple has not revealed sales figures for its smartwatch, but Mr Cook said on an earnings call that they \"met expectations\" during the quarter.\n\nGiven the absence of official sales figures, observers are left to speculate how Apple Watch is doing in the market. The fact that Apple Watch synchs to iPhones has raised doubts it could be a stand-alone hit instead of an accessory.\n\nApple Pay, the service that lets iPhones act as digital wallets, is viewed through a similarly dependent lens.\n\nApple has long been a ripe target for rumors, with recent speculation including talk that the company is working on self-driving cars and virtual reality.\n\n\"The car entry would be years away and it would not at all be clear if Apple would succeed - especially considering Tesla's recent success with its Model 3,\" FBN said in its note.\n\nTesla has been swamped with orders even though release of the car is a year away.\n\n\"The pace of innovation has completely slowed down at Apple,\" said Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry.\n\n\"The projects that Tim Cook is talking about are taking so much time... by the time they are ready they are already obsolete.\" Mr Chowdhry depicted Apple as a company that was in fine shape except for a bedeviling lack of vision and passion at the top, pointing a finger at Mr Cook, chief financial officer Luca Maestri, and senior vice president of retail and online stores Angela Ahrendts.\n\n\"Get rid of these three people, and Apple will come back to its past glory,\" the analyst said.\n\nApple has thus far delivered on the vision of Steve Jobs, and a new visionary who is at least as passionate as the iconic figure is needed to fix the company, Mr Chowdhry reasoned.\n\nHe recommended former Apple executive Jon Rubinstein for the job.\n\nFormer Apple manager Guy Kawasaki, who helped launch the Macintosh computer in the 1980s said in a CNBC television interview that the company needs to get back to making products people \"lust\" for.\n\nMr Kawasaki gave the example of iPhones that boast improvements from prior generations but don't stand apart from predecessors in big ways.\n\n\"We need a product that leaps to the next curve,\" Mr Kawasaki said.\n\n\"I don't think that is simply making the iPhone smaller or the iPad bigger\".

That was the lowest for a first quarter since a global recession roiled the market in 2009 and down from 70 per cent a year earlier.\n\nLondon's top hotels include the Savoy and the recently reopened Lanesborough, where the Royal Suite with a complementary chauffeured Rolls-Royce costs about \u00a325,000 pounds (S$48,962) per night.\n\nWhile demand for cheaper accommodation is falling too, luxury hotels are hardest hit because wealthy travelers and corporate clients are proving more sensitive to the political turmoil.\n\nThe terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris, the risk that the UK may vote to leave the EU and an economic slump in Russia have all contributed to the market's deterioration, along with the uncertain outcome of the US election.\n\n\"A lot of source markets are under pressure due to issues outside of London hoteliers' control,\" said Andreas Scriven, a hotel consultant at Christie & Co.\n\nMore wealthy Russians are vacationing at home and Americans travel less during election years, he said.\n\nBob van den Oord, managing director at the Langham hotel on Regent Street, attributes its weaker-than-expected performance to security concerns in Europe. \"There's anxiety out there about terrorism,\" he said. Rooms at the hotel start at \u00a3300 per night.\n\nThere's an excess of supply in the luxury segment, Mr Scriven said. That's after a new InterContinental hotel near the O2 Arena in north Greenwich and the refurbished Lanesborough hotel in the Knightsbridge district added more than 540 rooms in the past year.\n\nUncertainty ahead of the UK referendum on June 23 is causing business travelers to postpone investments, according to Russell Kett, chairman of hotel consultancy HVS's London office.\n\nThe UK had its worst quarter for deals since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First-quarter M&A spending on and by companies in the country was down 39 per cent from a year earlier, and the slowdown is poised to continue until June.\n\nThe drop in occupancy is hurting luxury hotels' income, pushing revenue per available room down by 6.5 per cent to the lowest for a first quarter in three years, according to STR. However, average daily room rates have held up because hoteliers would rather lose business than start a downward pricing spiral.\n\nRussia's elite are spending more time in their own country, as a weak ruble hurts their spending power and President Vladimir Putin urges Russians to travel within the country and support the ailing economy. UK visas granted to Russians fell 38 per cent last year.\n\n\"The decline in Russian visitors is just one of the issues facing London's luxury hotels, Mr Kett said. \"If you add it all together, it becomes an issue.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

It rose as high as US$0.6940 at one stage compared to a trough of US$0.6808 on Wednesday. It was also pulling closer to a 10-month peak of US$0.7055 touched last week.\n\n\"Today was a missed opportunity to reduce the upward pressure on the NZD,\" said Jarrod Kerr, a senior interest rate strategist at CBA, noting the kiwi had climbed three cents on its Australian counterpart in 24 hours.\n\nMarket pricing still implies a 62 per cent chance of a cut at the next policy meeting on June 9.\n\n\"We expect a rate cut in June and August, and possibly again in September,\" said Mr Kerr.\n\nNew Zealand government bonds chose to follow a rally in US Treasuries after the Federal Reserve sounded in no rush to hike after its policy meeting. Yields were as much as 5.5 basis points lower at the long end.\n\nThe Australian dollar was steady at US$0.7588, having slumped 2 per cent on Wednesday in the biggest one-day drop in eight months. Support was found at US$0.7548 and US$0.7526.\n\nSince touching a 10-month peak of US$0.7836 one week ago, the Aussie has dropped 2-1/2 cents.\n\nIt was knocked back after disturbingly soft inflation data revived expectations of a cut in rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).\n\nInterbank futures imply a 58 per cent chance of an easing to a record low of 1.75 per cent at the RBA's policy meeting next week, from 12 per cent earlier in the week.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of economists still forecast the central bank to keep rates steady on May 3.\n\nThe Aussie skidded two yen to 82.68 yen after the Bank of Japan disappointed bears who had wagered on further policy stimulus.

Some independent estimates put it as high as 50 million - which would put China among the world's top 10 Muslim nations.\n\nBeijing's officially atheist Communist authorities oscillate between tight restrictions and more liberal policies that are enforced unevenly.\n\nMr Deng's company is based in Ningxia, a western region a third of whose six million population are Hui.\n\nThe group are a separate minority under Beijing's classification policies even though most are essentially from the Han ethnic majority, differentiated only by being Muslims.\n\nViolence in Xinjiang, the homeland of the other main Muslim minority, the Uighurs, has killed hundreds, with Beijing attributing it to Islamic extremism and foreign influence, while activists blame draconian restrictions on religion and culture.\n\nIn a promotional video playing at Sai Wai Xiang's factory - set up 14 years ago - a table of happy Chinese diners clink glasses of beer before tucking into their meal.\n\n\"Drinking red wine is very good for the body and has health benefits, just like eating halal food,\" said Mr Deng, who recalled a recent trip to Bordeaux and said he often finishes a bottle of the local Ningxia vintages with dinner.\n\nThe global halal food and beverage market is projected to grow to US$1.6 trillion by 2018, according to a report from the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, up from US$1.1 trillion in 2013.\n\nMr Deng and other company executives pointed to President Xi Jinping's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative that aims to boost trade with a host of countries across South Asia and the Middle East, and he expects a windfall of incentives for halal food.\n\nBut there are concerns over how strictly halal standards are followed in China.\n\nLast year, hundred of Muslims took to the streets in Xi'an to protest the sale of alcohol in halal restaurants.\n\nIn Qinghai province, a crowd destroyed a bakery after pork sausages and ham were found in its delivery trucks.\n\nSuch fears have an impact in potential export markets, and food safety scares are common in China, from gutter oil to milk powder.\n\nThe integrity of Chinese halal food was \"questionable\", Miriam Abdul Latif, a professor of food science and a halal expert at the Malaysian University of Sabah, told AFP, citing examples of \"fake halal documents or certificates\".\n\nTo build consumer trust, Prof Latif said, Chinese companies should have their products inspected by certification bodies from Muslim countries.\n\nBut the issue goes to the heart - or perhaps the stomach - of the relationship between religion and the state.\n\nChina's current halal certification system is a patchwork of local regulations, with varying strictness. Mosques technically have the right to inspect nearby facilities, but ultimate power rests with local government Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureaux.\n\nAt a high-level national political meeting in Beijing last month, Ma Guoquan, a delegate from Ningxia, called for a single national standard for halal food, and improved enforcement.\n\n\"There are many problems regarding halal food management that can't be ignored,\" Mr Ma said, according to the Ningxia Daily newspaper.\n\nBut some say national laws would be anathema to the ruling party's official atheism.\n\n\"This kind of legislation would be contrary to the principle of secularism,\" Xi Wuyi, a Marxism expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote on China's Twitter-like Weibo in March. \"It could threaten China's national security strategy.\"\n\nAt the same time some Muslims complain over too much government interference in their religion.\n\nAway from the high-level politics of policing halal food, many of the faithful in Ningxia rely on personal relationships to guarantee quality.\n\n\"I know the meat I buy is halal because I know the butcher, I see him frequently at the mosque for prayer,\" said rural resident Na Liang. \"I know the baker, I know the family that runs the noodle shop and I know all the food I eat is halal.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

No size for the transaction was given.\n\nMAA Takaful held RM1.2 billion (S$410 million) worth of assets as of June 2015, a 5 per cent increase from a year earlier.\n\nThe Swiss insurer has been reshaping its geographic footprint, scaling back parts of its Asian franchise seeking to build more sustainable businesses and improve profitability.\n\nA move into takaful could allow for greater penetration in core markets in the Gulf and southeast Asia. Zurich Insurance also has a presence in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAn alternative to conventional insurance, takaful is based on the concept of mutuality; the takaful company oversees a pool of funds contributed by all policy holders.\n\nIn their investments, takaful firms follow religious guidelines, including bans on interest and pure monetary speculation, and a prohibition on investing in industries such as alcohol and gambling.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also claim parts of the waters, through which about US$5 trillion in trade is shipped every year.\n\nChina has rattled nerves with its military and construction activities on tiny islands in the disputed waters, including building runways, though it says most of its activity is for civilian purposes.\n\nChinese officials say the United States is pushing militarisation and endangering stability with \"freedom of navigation\" operations by its military ships and aircraft in the South and East China seas.\n\nThe United States says it conducts such patrols across the world in an effort to demonstrate that the international community does not accept restrictions set up by some countries in international waters.\n\nThe Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia involves 26 members, including Russia and many countries from Central Asia and the Middle East.

He also wanted to have a fellow chess master on the board, he said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nLast June, Ms Huffington said she signed a four-year contract to remain in her roles at the Huffington Post following its acquisition by Verizon Communications Inc. She founded the news website in 2005.\n\nTechnology companies have been under pressure to add more women to their top ranks. The addition of Huffington to the board gives Uber, founded in 2009, a female director earlier in its life than, say, Facebook Inc, which welcomed Sheryl Sandberg to the inner circle in 2012.\n\nHowever, Uber has faced criticism for its attitude toward women. In 2014, an Uber executive suggested the company should dig up the personal details of a female journalist, and in an embarrassing turn of events last year, the United Nations backed out of a UN Women partnership with Uber amid pressure from union and non-governmental organizations.\n\nLyft Inc, Uber's main competitor in the US, paints itself as a more female-friendly service, with a larger share of its drivers being women.\n\nMeanwhile, Uber is working to fulfill a promise to shareholders and employees that it will be profitable in North America by the second quarter of 2016, and at the same time, is accelerating its expansion to global markets as it seeks to justify its valuation.\n\nIt has also been facing increasing competition from Lyft in the US and from other ride-sharing services elsewhere in the world. While Uber has a moral obligation to find liquidity for its investors and employees, the five-year-old company is still too young to go public, Mr Kalanick said on CNBC.\n\nUber faces resistance from traditional taxi systems worldwide, in an industry where competition is outlawed, he said.\n\nUber recently agreed to pay as much as US$100 million to settle a class-action lawsuit from drivers who claimed they should be classified as employees, not independent contractors.\n\nAs part of the deal, interpreted by some as a big win for the company, Uber will no longer ban them for failing to accept new fares - what the company calls deactivation. That's a new way to hold Uber accountable, Mr Kalanick said.\n\n\"The question for Uber is do we resist the future or find a way to become part of it,\" he said.\n\n\"If we embrace it, then it's how to optimistically lead through it.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

She said authorities were not searching for any suspects.\n\nThe San Jose Mercury News, citing emergency dispatch calls, said initial calls to police reported a man with a head wound.\n\nDispatch audio posted on the newspaper's website also shows that the unidentified victim was found in a conference room on the campus with a gun.\n\nSgt Urena declined to comment on those reports at the press conference.\n\n\"We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of a young and talented coworker. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends, including the many people he worked with here at Apple,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe so-called Infinite Loop campus was calm on a cold and windy day in suburban Cupertino. A vehicle for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department could be spotted in the parking lot, as well as a handful of white Apple security vehicles with flashing yellow lights on top.\n\nThe Infinite Loop campus is the hub for Apple's vast workforce in Cupertino, which numbers 16,000 employees, according to a 2013 report on the company's economic impact. The company is constructing another campus in the city, a massive loop of glass often likened to a spaceship.\n\nApple on Tuesday reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

As opponents criticize such regulations as futile in the face of the growing popularity of bitcoin, Russia joins countries including Bolivia, Iceland and Vietnam in taking steps to criminalize it.\n\n\"Bitcoin can be used to finance the shadow economy and crimes, and this risk we cannot allow in the Russia's financial system, which we are striving to make transparent and healthy,\" the press service of the central bank said in an e-mail.\n\nRussia has struggled since the fall of the Soviet Union to build confidence in the ruble and curb the once-common practice of Russians demanding payment in US dollars and other foreign currencies. A decade ago, the government dropped capital controls limiting cash outflows, and in 2014, the Bank of Russia began to allow the ruble's value to be set almost entirely by the market.\n\nLast year, the central bank revoked the licenses of 34 lenders for reasons such as allegedly violating the laws prohibiting money laundering or financing terrorism. The Finance Ministry's proposal would prohibit the issuance of all cryptocurrencies or their use in exchange for goods and services in Russia. Penalties would start at four years in prison and a fine of 500,000 rubles for individuals, with the harshest reserved for those in the management of financial firms.\n\n\"We can see how swiftly, pretty much over the course of the year, this became a reality of our economic life,\" Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an interview. Bitcoin \"in its essence is a money surrogate, so ultimately that leads to the central bank losing control over the money supply.\"\n\nDigital currencies like bitcoin are not controlled by any government or central bank, and can allow users to protect their savings against declines in national currencies and move money across borders without the participation of banks.\n\nBitcoin has provided a haven for citizens of countries like Venezuela, where access to the official exchange rate of 10 bolivars per dollar is severely limited, creating a black market where the local currency's 98 per cent plunge in the past three years means US$1 costs about 1,100 bolivars. In Russia, the ruble has fallen about 44 per cent against the US dollar since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine two years ago.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are stoking a multi-billion dollar underworld economy because they're easy to transmit and largely untraceable, the technology underlying them is also being embraced by Wall Street and even the Bank of England as a potential game changer in securities trading and settlement, making cross-border payments, and regulating financial transactions with more transparency.\n\nRussia also has a favorable view of blockchain, Mr Moiseev said, calling the technology \"promising,\" with \"a great future.\" Hackers are increasingly demanding ransom payments in bitcoin, according to Internet security firm Kaspersky Lab, which also has found that the three top origins of attacks by hackers are China, Russia and the US.\n\n\"There is a wave going of so-called ransomware when a virus enters a person's computer and encrypts all files and there is no way to decrypt,\" said Sergey Lozhkin, a senior researcher at Kaspersky Lab.\n\n\"Cybercriminals at that moment start extorting money to decrypt files on the computer and they ask for ransom in bitcoins.\" Bitcoin accounts for more than 40 per cent of criminal-to-criminal payments in the European Union, Jan Op Gen Oorth, a spokesman for EU law-enforcement agency Europol said in an e- mail.\n\nAccording to Mr Lozhkin and other experts, however, efforts to ban bitcoin by Russian or any other country won't work.\n\n\"A ban would be impossible to enforce because it is a peer- to-peer technology, it is a file sharing technology, and all people need to do to get around the ban is to have computers with an Internet connection,\"said Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a Washington group that promotes the cryptocurrency.\n\n\"This perspective is out of step with the rest of the world.

That means about 4 gigawatts of clean-energy projects are up for sale, more than 10 per cent of the nation's existing solar and wind capacity, according to industry executives.\n\n\"There are 2 gigawatts odd of wind assets comprising medium and small portfolios,\" Rahul Shah, chief executive at Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd, the clean-energy arm of Tata Power Co, said in an interview in Mumbai. \"In solar, again 2 gigawatts odd, finished and unfinished projects are looking for buyers.\"\n\nA gigawatt is about as much as a nuclear reactor can produce, and global solar installations last year were about 40 gigawatts. That much capacity on the market threatens to push down prices and make lenders reluctant to finance projects, meaning a portion of the projects being planned could ultimately be scuppered. In turn, that would endanger Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target to install 100 gigawatts of solar by 2020 at an estimated cost of US$100 billion.\n\nIndia has 6.7 gigawatts of solar capacity and 26.7 gigawatts of wind power, according to the latest government data.\n\nA drop in tariffs paid for solar power is being blamed for distorting the Indian clean energy market. SunEdison is partly behind that trend, having taken all 500 megawatts of capacity offered in an auction in November in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. It offered to sell electricity at a record low for India at the time.\n\nSolar tariffs in India have fallen sharply from 8 US cents a kilowatt-hour in July 2015 to a record low of 6 US cents a kilowatt-hour in January.\n\n\"For the likes of SunEdison, who may have to get some kind of capital to be able to build the committed projects, it will mostly be desperate deals at this stage,\" Jasmeet Khurana, associate director for consulting at solar researcher Bridge to India, said in an interview in New Delhi.\n\n\"Premiums will come down because there will be desperate deals.\" Moreover, some projects may have difficulty finding buyers if the delivery deadline set by power purchase agreements is nearing and the projects aren't yet completed, according to Kailash Vaswani, deputy chief financial officer at ReNew Power Ventures Pvt, an Indian clean-energy company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n\"If one fails to deliver projects on time, the power purchase agreement is scrapped, so unbuilt projects will find it very hard to be sold if that kind of a time bomb is ticking away,\" Mr Vaswani said in an interview in New Delhi on Tuesday.\n\n\"Many of these assets may not even get built.\"\n\nInvestment bankers trying to match buyers and sellers for clean-energy assets say there is limited scope for significant premiums for projects awarded recently.\n\n\"This is driven by increased aggressiveness in project assumptions and an overall tightening of returns,\" Rahul Goswami, a managing director at clean-energy investment bank Greenstone Energy Advisors, said in an e-mail.\n\nGreenstone Energy is involved in some of the transactions involving renewable capacity.\n\nLower prices for solar energy are only desirable so long as they can be maintained, according to International Finance Corp, a unit of the World Bank. Gaetan Tiberghien, the principal investment officer on infrastructure and natural resources for IFC South Asia, said the market must allow investors to earn a return to keep them interested in funneling money into green-energy projects in India.\n\n\"If the risk-return balance is not adequate, there is an increased probability that fewer investors will bid and that awarded projects don't get built,\" Mr Tiberghien said by e-mail.\n\nIndia already faces several hurdles in financing Mr Modi's ambitions for renewable energy. Central bank data show that about 14 per cent of loans to the industry have soured or been written off.\n\nSunEdison's filing isn't helping. Last week, SunEdison listed US$16.1 billion of debt in Chapter 11 filings in Manhattan federal court, making it the biggest US bankruptcy in more than a year. The company based in Maryland Heights, Missouri, has 700 megawatts of commissioned assets in India and 1.7 gigawatts of projects being planned.\n\n\"Half of the solar installations in the country are looking for buyers, and it's a buyers' market,\" said Ravi Khanna, CEO of the solar business at Aditya Birla Group, an Indian manufacturer in the Fortune 500.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/9782126d0c883fa876dd36a57c6e7e8c19e36815d4be0a6d3d8e08ea94605a5c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "SunEdison Inc's bankruptcy filing is reverberating halfway around the world in India, where developers say the US company's troubles are adding to a surplus of green capacity up for sale."}]}

The report shows the challenges facing agency chief Ning Jizhe, a close adviser to Premier Li Keqiang who was named to the position in February after former head Wang Baoan was removed over unspecified corruption allegations after less than a year on the job.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

The latest hotspot is Sarawak on Borneo island where a 28.9 billion ringgit, 1,796-kilometre toll-free highway linking the state and Sabah is being built before a crucial state election in May.\n\n\"The construction industry will be very exciting as these jobs are expected to be awarded in the next two years. There could be as much as 200 billion ringgit of jobs out there,\" said Mr Wong, the chief executive officer of Areca Capital Sdn Bhd, who correctly predicted this year's slump in technology shares and a rebound in energy companies.\n\n\"We can't ignore them. Sarawak stocks are in focus because of the Pan Borneo highway and also the election, where there are bound to be goodies.\"\n\nConstruction companies are trading at the highest level relative to the Malaysian equity benchmark in four years as a building boom takes hold. With an estimated 136 billion ringgit of jobs in the pipeline in 2016 alone, a CIMB Group Holdings Bhd report predicts more gains as share prices haven't fully priced in the earnings potential.\n\nThe awards bonanza from rail to roads also comes amid an \"election play\" on some contractors as Prime Minister Najib Razak's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition bids to retain Sarawak - a state held since 1963 - in polls May 7.\n\nThe Bursa Malaysia Construction Index has risen 21 per cent from an August low and is priced at 1.2 times net assets, near the most expensive level in almost a year. It's up 3.2 per cent in 2016, beating the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index that's fallen 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe biggest gainers in the building gauge this year are Ekovest Bhd and Kimlun Corp which have jumped at least 28 per cent. The building gauge rose 0.1 per cent on Thursday, its second day of increases.\n\nAreca's Mr Wong owns shares of Gamuda Bhd, the biggest builder by market value, Sunway Construction Bhd, Mitrajaya Holdings Bhd and Econpile Holdings Bhd.\n\nHe sold Kimlun because of its out-performance, as well as some Sarawak stocks.\n\nUnder the 11th Malaysia Plan, the government will set aside 260 billion ringgit for development expenditure from 2016 to 2020, the culmination of a strategy to achieve high-income status. Other projects being planned include the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed line and subway extensions around the capital.\n\nMajor jobs totaling 24 billion ringgit were handed out in the first quarter, a good gauge of what's in store for the rest of 2016, Sharizan Rosely, a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst at CIMB, who has an overweight rating on the industry, wrote in a report earlier this month.\n\n\"The construction sector is set for a new boom phase for civil and infrastructure works in 2016,\" he said. This year \"marks a big comeback of jobs for the sector as it is the first year of implementation of the 11th Malaysia Plan, with major high-multiplier and larger-value projects shifting to the long awaited award phase.\"\n\nWith the Sarawak polls drawing near, the rollout of more infrastructure jobs is expected to benefit Gamuda and IJM Corp, while rivals based in the state including Hock Seng Lee Bhd, Naim Holdings Bhd, Zecon Bhd and Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd are potential winners, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co report.\n\n\"Sarawak construction companies are natural beneficiaries given the requirement for 70 per cent local participation,\" Mak Hoy Kit, a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in the report.\n\nHock Seng Lee, Sarawak's largest builder, has surged 15 per cent from its August low, while Zecon Bhd has rallied 33 per cent from the lowest level in September. Mr Najib touted development of Sarawak and neighboring Sabah in October, pledging funds for paddy fertilizers, longhouses and the Pan Borneo road project.\n\nSarawak played a crucial role in helping the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition retain power, with 25 of 133 parliamentary seats. It won 133 of 222 seats at the 2013 general election.\n\nWhile construction stocks will continue to be in favor as job flows remain buoyant, prices could retreat before another rally happens, according to Tan Ming Han, Kuala Lumpur-based senior investment manager of Amundi Malaysia.\n\n\"There should be some profit-taking until construction companies book these contracts into profits,\" said Mr Tan, whose KAF Vision Fund returned 20 per cent over the past three years, beating 95 per cent of its peers. \"News of these contract win have been built into the share prices.\" Even after the rally by builders, Areca's Mr Wong still owns some Sarawak stocks, saying there are still opportunities in construction companies.\n\n\"Big caps are not cheap, but they have the potential to clinch very big jobs.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

And I, as a leader, was too aggressive.\"\n\n\"While raising the prices of these drugs increased the profits of Valeant, it destroyed enormous shareholder value,\" said Bill Ackman, who sits on the company's board and whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP was one of its biggest holders.\n\nThe stock's plunge - down 87 per cent since its August peak - has cost Mr Ackman's fund billions, and cost Mr Pearson his job. In a half-empty hearing room in Washington Wednesday, it became apparent that it has also forced a major reassessment of Valeant's strategy of sharp price increases, often on older medicines the company acquired through deals.\n\n\"By all accounts, Valeant is the company that perfected the strategy of strategic acquisitions and price hikes that made it Wall Street's dream come true,\" said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee.\n\nAt the hearing, Ms McCaskill and her Republican counterpart, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, honed in on four drugs. Isuprel and Nitropress are heart treatments that Valeant acquired and then quickly raised their prices by 525 per cent and 212 per cent, respectively.\n\nTwo others, Syprine and Cuprimine, are used to treat a genetic disorder called Wilson's disease. Valeant raised Cuprimine's price for 100 capsules to US$26,189 from US$888, and Syprine's increased by more than 30-fold, Ms Collins said.\n\nAsked if there was any drug that the company sold in the US that Valeant hadn't raised the price on after acquiring it through a deal, Mr Pearson said he couldn't name any.\n\nValeant's stock fell 3.6 per cent to US$34.92 at the close in New York. Valeant is also planning to shake up its board, replacing five directors, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nOne of those likely departing is Mason Morfit, president at ValueAct Capital Management LLC, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The person asked not to be identified because the matter is private. One of the seats will be taken by Joe Papa, former CEO of Perrigo Co, who will become CEO and chairman of Valeant, replacing Mr Pearson.\n\nThe drugmaker's tactics eventually brought the focus of health insurers and politicians who pushed back on covering products and hauled it up to Capitol Hill for hearings.\n\nOne patient, Berna Heyman, told the committee that she suffers from Wilson's disease and used to take Syprine. The disorder, sometimes fatal, causes copper to accumulate in the brain, liver and other organs. After Valeant acquired the drug, her co-payments for it went from less than US$700 a year to more than US$10,000.\n\nShe wrote to Valeant about the cost, she said, and the company told her it needed to charge that much to make investments in its drugs. After a story about her appeared in the Financial Times, she said the company telephoned and offered to help. She refused, she said, not wanting special treatment others didn't get. Then a florist called, saying that Valeant had sent her flowers.\n\n\"I refused the flowers and asked that the sender be informed of my refusal,\" Ms Heyman told the committee.\n\nMr Ackman said that after listening as Ms Heyman and two doctors described their difficulties because of Valeant's drug prices, he texted the chairman of the board to convene a meeting.\n\n\"My recommendation is going to be that we reduce the prices of those drugs,\" Mr Ackman told the lawmakers. He said the company needed to start using \"socially responsible pricing.\" Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said promises were good, but not enough.\n\n\"Why should we believe you?\" Mr Ackman said that the committee's oversight, which has come with a parallel investigation from the House of Representatives, had punished the drugmaker, along with any other company that investors suspected of using similar aggressive pricing.\n\n\"This committee has done a good job elevating the issue of pricing, and it's done a good job of taking about US$80 billion of market value off Valeant,\" Mr Ackman said. \"That has not gone unnoticed just by Valeant, but by every other drug company in the country.\" Ms Collins said the committee's drug price hearings are likely now over, and it plans to issue a report on their findings.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7cef100e3f1268320d5b0885cad22845994a8920a0238fcf7c36d16f2eba7348?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "After US$77 billion in lost market value, congressional hearings and corporate stumbles, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's CEO and its biggest hedge fund booster stood before a Senate committee, raised their right hands in truth, and said the drug company had gotten things wrong."}]}

Policymakers have been waiting on the slew of economic indicators being released Thursday before making any decision to adjust stimulus, according to people familiar with discussions at the bank.\n\nThe BOJ's core price measure \"will likely stay near zero or fall in the coming months because of downward pressure from declines in energy costs,\" Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center, said before the release.\n\n\"It's very difficult to see the inflation rate reaching the 2 per cent price goal by the end of the next fiscal year.\"\n\nThe next fiscal year ends in March 2018, and governor Haruhiko Kuroda's five-year term ends in April of that year.\n\nMr Muto said it's getting harder for Mr Kuroda to keep saying that the price trend is improving, adding that pressure is building on the BOJ to ease monetary policy further.\n\nIt's also likely that food inflation has peaked, according to a research note from JPMorgan Securities economist Masamichi Adachi, who was writing before the data was released.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

When enacted, the action will amount to a 3-for-1 split that will send about 5.7 billion new Facebook shares into the world, stripped of voting rights.\n\nSuch strategies are becoming more popular at companies with multiple class arrangements as a way of insulating founders from dilution. With a new category of non-voting stock at his disposal, chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg can use the new shares for things like acquisitions and compensation without fear of reducing his influence.\n\n\"This will become fairly common for strong founder CEOs that have established a long tenure of performance,\" Ryan Jacob, manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, which oversees US$40 million including Facebook shares, said by phone.\n\n\"It's a trend that we'll see continue as companies get larger. Issues of share dilution come up much sooner for these types of companies, which offer a large portion of compensation through stock.\"\n\nWhile not a universally beloved tactic, Facebook holders might be hard-pressed to complain about anything given the performance of the stock.\n\nAfter coming to market at US$38 in May 2012, the stock has nearly tripled, and the company was the fastest in US history to get to US$250 billion in market value. It's capitalization today is US$309 billion, bigger than 27 of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average members.\n\n\"Investors are remarkably willing to overlook sub-optimal governance decisions when things are going well. The opposite is true when things are not,\" said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group LLC in New York.\n\n\"If you're the controlling shareholder and you believe you need this, then the best time to do it is when things are going well.\"\n\nLike Google, Facebook began its stock market life with two sets of stock: Class A shares, which is what the average investor owns, and Class B stock that confers 10 voting rights and is mainly held by company insiders. Facebook has about 2.29 billion Class A shares outstanding and 551 million of Class B.\n\nIf you're a Facebook shareholder, the net effect of the plan will be to have three shares of stock where you once had one, with the price falling by two-thirds when the new shares hit the market. While the new shares will carry no voting rights, your proportionate influence on things like proxy proposals will stay the same.\n\nThe creation of the new class requires shareholder approval, after which Facebook intends to implement the proposal immediately. The date for a vote hasn't been set.\n\nThe measure is \"to ensure that the company maintains its long-term focus,\" David Wehner, the chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"A large part of Facebook's success is due to Mark's leadership and this proposal will allow us to maintain that founder-led approach that has served our shareholders well.\"\n\nThe proposal followed an analysis by a special committee of Facebook's board comprising directors Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Marc Andreessen, and Erskine B Bowles. The panel was formed after an August 2015 discussion with Mr Zuckerberg in which he noted he might lose control of the company if he gave away large number of shares or if Facebook made a large acquisition.\n\nFor his part, the CEO portrayed the issuance as part of a larger strategy that will free him to give away 99 per cent of his Facebook shares sooner, for causes such as \"helping cure all diseases by the end of the century,\" he said a blog post.\n\n\"I'll be able to keep founder control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, and Priscilla and I will be able to give our money to fund important work sooner,\" he said, referring to his wife.\n\nSuch actions have not always sat well with institutional investors. Google's plan, announced in April 2012, drew a legal complaint from a Massachusetts pension fund and other investors who said it would unfairly allow founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to strengthen their corporate control. The suit was settled before testimony began in a Delaware court in June 2013.\n\nFacebook noted in an SEC filing: The holding of low- or non-voting stock, such as our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to the portfolio managers of certain institutional investors.\n\nMr Zuckerberg controls a majority of voting rights at Facebook. So great is his influence, in fact, that the company noted it didn't need the \"yes\" vote of any other stockholder to push the plan through.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

If it flops, that is something that we can take personally too.\" One of the first steps in the writing process is developing a broad list of potential topics, which is circulated both inside and outside the White House.\n\nFormer Obama aides Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and David Axelrod are among those consulted this year.\n\nListening to other people \"is a big part of the process\" said Mr Lechtenberg. \"Every idea in the brain storming stage is a good idea.\" But then comes the tough task of whittling all those ideas down.\n\n\"We'll probably have maybe 100 jokes total and bring them down to 20-25 by the end,\" said Mr Keenan. \"You've got to have a thick skin because most of your jokes are going to get cut.\" Mr Lechtenberg describes the process as having a \"herding cats\" feel.\n\nThere will be some digs at political opponents and some at his hosts and the journalists who cover the White House and have invited all the guests.\n\nBut the most important element might be self-deprecation.\n\n\"He will spend a good chunk of time making fun of himself,\" said Mr Keenan. \"It's critical.\" \"You have to show that you are willing to poke fun of yourself to build a little credibility with the audience,\" he added.\n\n\"If you just go out there and rip on everybody else, that's not fun.\" One president who shone in that task was Bill Clinton, who in 1993, at the outset of his administration, was lying low in the polls.\n\n\"I don't think I'm doing so bad. I mean, at this point in his administration, William Henry Harrison had been dead for 68 days!\" he joked.\n\nWhen it comes to roasting others, there is a fine line between humor and humiliation, especially when the person doing the roasting is the most powerful on the planet.\n\nMr Obama takes a very hands-on role in crafting his speeches.\n\n\"If there was ever something in a speech that's too hurtful, he would take it out,\" said Mr Keenan.\n\n\"We don't want anyone to leave the dinner feeling hurt.\" But in 2011 Obama tested the boundaries of that dictum when he poked fun at Donald Trump, a man now vying to be his successor.\n\nFor months, the controversy courting businessman had fueled rumors that Mr Obama, the first black American president, was not born in the United States.\n\nAt one point Mr Obama even released his birth certificate, while admonishing theorists and the press: \"We do not have time for this kind of silliness.\" A few days later, he took advantage of the presence of the extravagant billionaire at the dinner to let loose.\n\n\"Now, I know that he's taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,\" Mr Obama began.\n\n\"And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter - like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\" The roast continued as Mr Trump sat among a sea of laughing guests.\n\nMr Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the race for the White House, has said he will not attend Saturday's dinner, suggesting that the media would misreport his mood.\n\n\"I don't think we have ever held back before so I would not expect anything radically different this time,\" said Mr Keenan in previewing this year's speech.\n\nWhat will be different is that it is both Mr Obama's and Mr Keenan's last.\n\n\"It's very daunting to think about what I will do after this that has the same sense of purpose to it,\" he said.\n\n\"The notion that I might have peaked at 35 is terrifying,\" he said with a laugh, adding \"it has been a blast.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Annualized, that's US$81,600 a year, according to data collected by Rodney Folz, a former University of California Berkeley student and soon-to-be Yelp intern.\n\nThe national wage index is US$46,481.52, according to data last compiled by the Social Security Administrationin 2014. Looking to put together a data set of what his peers earn, Mr Folz sent a Google survey to a variety of computer science and technology groups and listservs, including groups for women, the LGBTQ community, and African Americans. He also solicited reports from friends with technology company internships.\n\nHis survey was answered anonymously by 503 people who said they landed internships in software or electrical engineering, product design or management, industrial design, and program management.\n\nThe students were placed at dozens of technology companies, including Apple Inc, Google Inc and Uber Technologies Inc. As with any online survey, there's room for bad data. Three future interns said they landed internships with Snapchat, the social network based in Venice, California, ranging from US$9,000 to US$11,000 a month, which Mr Folz's network had doubts about.\n\n\"A couple (of) people had mentioned they didn't believe the Snapchat offer,\" he said. Four responders said Groupon, the e-commerce company that provides discount deals, offered interns in Seattle and Palo Alto benefit packages worth US$13,000, which Mr Folz said was also met with skepticism among his peers. \"Groupon, I saw jokes about that on Twitter.\"\n\nSnapchat declined to comment, and Groupon did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe US$6,800 median monthly salary mentioned above was pulled from only the 18 companies that received the most replies, a total of 298 responses. Based on that sample, the monthly intern haul ranged from US$9,000 at Pinterest Inc, an online bookmarking platform based in San Francisco, to US$4,500 at Tesla Motors in Palo Alto, California.\n\nMr Folz's survey also asked about other cash benefits that companies offered interns, such as housing and travel stipends. Those ranged from zip all the way to US$10,500 at Twitch, the live-streaming video platform based in San Francisco. Respondents said Twitch's stipend went for corporate housing and travel expenses. Twitch confirmed that number.\n\n\"Google offers a competitive compensation package to all interns and employees,\" said Roya Soleimani, the company's corporate communications manager, in an e-mailed statement.\n\nMr Folz's research found that Google pays interns a median US$6,666 per month, along with a median US$9,000 stipend. Salary website Glassdoor reports similar numbers for Google software engineering interns - an average of US$6,757 per month.\n\nGoogle was ranked third on Glassdoor's list of highest-rated companies for internships last year. Mr Folz's data showed that Pinterest interns earn a median US$9,000 per month, but Glassdoor's average put the number a bit lower, between US$6,574 and US$7,675.\n\nPinterest spokesperson Jamie Favazza said the company does not disclose compensation details but added, \"We offer competitive salaries to all candidates. Our engineering interns start writing code in their first week and are an important part of our growing engineering team.\"\n\nTwitch's spokesperson, who uses only the first name Chase, confirmed the survey data, which found that interns make US$7,200 a month. Intuit said the median monthly salary of US$6,000 determined by the survey was an underestimate but declined to say what it paid interns.\n\nThe tax preparation software company said corporate housing is also offered to interns. Other companies mentioned in this article declined to comment or did not reply to request for comment.\n\nMr Folz said he created the survey in an effort to ensure young workers in the technology industry did not \"undervalue themselves.\" Silicon Valley interns can find themselves working on live projects that have the potential to earn substantial money for the company.\n\n\"The roles they offer to interns, they're basically full-time responsibilities but for three months at a time,\" Mr Folz said.\n\n\"A lot of the products that these student interns (work on) end up being part of the core product that these companies own.\"\n\nThough responders attended a variety of universities and studied at a various levels, they had one thing in common: The vast majority said they did not attempt to negotiate their salary.\n\n\"I think the idea of being courted like this, being paid so much, being offered so much responsibility at a new job doing real things, is really exciting, especially when it's never happened to you before,\" Mr Folz explained.\n\n\"They don't want to ruin it by trying to ask for more.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The performance on mobile helped PayPal on Wednesday post first-quarter sales and profit that were higher than projected.\n\nMore than 21 million customers of PayPal's 184 million account holders are using the feature that was introduced last year, which Mr Schulman said indicates customers like the product and more of them will embrace it.\n\n\"This is the most rapidly adopted service in PayPal's history,\" said Mr Schulman, who took over as CEO in July when PayPal split from its parent company EBay Inc.\n\n\"We have a lot more potential with this service.\"\n\nMr Schulman wants to transform the company from a payment button on a website into a versatile financial tool that lets users pay merchants, send money to friends and discover nearby dining and shopping options through smartphone apps.\n\nHe hopes adding new functions will make PayPal users more engaged with the platform on mobile devices and less likely to defect to payment options from Apple Inc, Visa Inc and Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nPayPal gained as much as 6 per cent to US$42.42 in extended trading after closing at US$40.01 in New York. The company's stock has increased 11 per cent this year.\n\nTransactions Volume\n\nPayPal handled US$81.1 billion in transactions in the first quarter, an increase of 31 per cent from a year earlier, and a key metric to gauge growth. The company added 4.5 million new customer accounts and now has 14 million merchants taking payments through the platform.\n\nProfit, excluding certain items, was 37 US cents a share on revenue of US$2.54 billion in the quarter, San Jose, California-based PayPal said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nAnalysts on average projected earnings of 35 US cents and sales of US$2.50 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue was US$2.14 billion in the period a year earlier.\n\nNet income was US$365 million, or 30 US cents a share, in the quarter compared with US$255 million, or 21 US cents, a year earlier.\n\n\"Accelerating TPV to 31 per cent and revenue to 23 per cent growth rates are the most impressive figures, especially considering most other large technology companies are dealing with decelerating growth,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.\n\nMobile Payments\n\nPayPal's payments on mobile devices are helping the company stand out as shoppers shift their spending from desktop computers to smartphones, said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.\n\nSpending on mobile devices in the US is expected to increase 39 per cent this year to more than US$123 billion, according to EMarketer.\n\n\"People are making mobile payments on the go and PayPal makes it extremely simple,\" Mr Olson said.\n\n\"They were at the right place at the right time with the right technology.\"\n\nThe electronic payments company forecast earnings, except certain items, in the current quarter of 34 US cents to 36 US cents a share, compared with estimates for 35 US cents. The company said it sees revenue of US$2.57 billion to US$2.62 billion, compared with estimates of US$2.58 billion.\n\nThe company's take rate, the amount of each transaction PayPal keeps for itself, was 3.14 per cent. It's another number watched by investors. The result topped projections from Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, who projected a rate of 2.84 per cent.\n\nApart from adding new users, Mr Schulman said PayPal's customers are more engaged, completing an average of 28 transactions in the quarter, up from 25 a year earlier. Mr Schulman sees customer engagement as a key measure indicating PayPal is broadening its reach beyond online shopping.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

This was attributable to softer investors' appetite due to volatile market conditions.\n\nTotal expenses increased 4.9 per cent from a year ago to S$894 million, largely from higher staff costs, revenue and IT-related expenses, as the group continued to invest in capabilities and infrastructure to strengthen customer franchise and enhance technology capabilities.\n\nNon-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained stable at 1.4 per cent, while NPL coverage was high at 133.2 per cent, and 325.3 per cent after taking collateral into account.\n\nSaid Wee Ee Cheong, UOB's deputy chairman and chief executive officer: \"While revenue has moderated in line with the slower growth environment, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet, with stable asset quality and strong core capitalisation. Our recent successful issuances of covered bonds and subordinated notes reflect the confidence investors have in us.\n\n\"Even as the region faces macro headwinds in the near term, we believe its economic fundamentals are largely capable of coping with bouts of market volatility.

The Mitsubishi Motors board formed a panel of three ex- prosecutors to investigate for about three months. Until then, customers, investors and minicar partner Nissan Motor Co may be left waiting for information about the number of affected models and details of compensation.\n\n\"I'm taking this as a case that could affect our company's existence,\" president Tetsuro Aikawa told reporters during a press conference on Tuesday. \"My mission is to solve the issue.\" On Tuesday, Mitsubishi Motors shares plunged for a fifth day, slashing the company's market value by half during that span to about 427 billion yen (S$5.17 billion). The deepening crisis is the worst since the carmaker covered up defective axles that led wheels to detach in fatal accidents, prompting multiple bailouts from Mitsubishi group companies.\n\nThe stock climbed 1.6 per cent to 441 yen in early Tokyo trading on Wednesday.\n\n\"Right now, understanding which cars and how many of them are at stake is the most important thing,\" Koji Endo, a Tokyo-based analyst with Advanced Research Japan, said by phone. After two press conferences in the span of a week, investors are \"still waiting for a proper report\". Mitsubishi Motors hasn't decided how it will compensate customers, Mr Aikawa said. The company is in discussions about reimbursing Nissan, which was supplied about three-quarters of the 625,000 minicars that were improperly tested and relied on manipulated data. Nissan has since voluntarily stopped sales of the Japan-only models, called Dayz and Dayz Roox.\n\nDepending on how many more vehicles were improperly tested, the company \"will get into a situation where its survival is difficult\", Mr Endo said.\n\nWrongdoing by the Japanese carmaker and Volkswagen AG has prompted a reckoning of the ways carmakers test for and label the fuel economy and exhaust emissions of their vehicles. Government investigators last week raided French manufacturer PSA Group as part of broader checks into vehicle emissions, while Daimler AG initiated an internal probe into its certification process at the behest of the US Department of Justice.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board also announced an investigation of whether models sold in the US meet fuel economy regulations.\n\nThe EPA has instructed Mitsubishi to provide additional information on vehicles sold in the US and will direct the company to conduct additional testing, EPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday in Washington.\n\nJapan's transport ministry asked Mitsubishi Motors to re-submit findings from its investigation of improper testing methods by May 11. An initial report that the company provided the regulator ahead of a Wednesday deadline was insufficient, a ministry official said on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to potential payouts to customers and Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors may have to pay back government tax rebates that its minicars shouldn't have been eligible for, Ryugo Nakao, an executive vice-president, has said.\n\nNissan first uncovered fuel economy discrepancies when working on development for the next generation of the minicars. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said Monday that Nissan will decide on the future of the partnership after further verification.

And if not, the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.\"\n\nBut in an apparent contradiction, the 69-year-old Trump, buoyed by his latest big win in the polls, also attacked President Barack Obama - accusing him of abandoning US allies like Israel while reaching out to Iran.\n\n\"We picked fights with our oldest friends and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nHe was clear, however, on where the greatest threat to the United States lies, accusing Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton of a refusal to name it.\n\n\"Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and, indeed, the world,\" he said.\n\nDavid Pollock, a former senior State Department advisor and now Washington Institute fellow, told AFP: \"It seemed to be a more appealing presentation of Mr Trump's themes in a softer and smarter way, but left many questions unanswered.\n\n\"And a key test of that will be what kind of new advisors he can find who will publicly side with him and join the team.\"\n\nMr Trump has been mocked for failing to secure big-name foreign policy endorsements and relying on a coterie of right-wing fringe figures.\n\nBut he defended his team, slamming the available talent in Washington circles as tainted by the chaos unleashed in Iraq under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.\"\n\nBut many experts noted that Mr Trump was announced at the podium by one of Bush's closest advisors on the Middle East, former ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\nThis was seen as a sign that as Mr Trump's nomination appears more likely, more leading Republicans would come to his side.\n\nTom Wright, director of The Brookings Institution's Project on International Order and Strategy, said Mr Trump remains far from the Republican mainstream.\n\nBut the speech may provide a \"comfort blanket\" for non-foreign policy specialists who want to believe he can mount a credible campaign come November.\n\n\"He said he wanted to be a reliable ally, that he was focused on American interests but that America had a role to play,\" he said.\n\n\"But then he also said that if the allies didn't pay for a large proportion of the cost... then he would walk away.\"\n\nFor Mr Wright, smoother presentation aside, nothing in Mr Trump's address will reconcile him with the conservative foreign policy establishment.\n\nTrump failed to mention Ukraine and suggested he could negotiate a new relationship with Russia.\n\nHe also discussed China's power as an economic challenge, not a geopolitical one.\n\n\"There'll be a lot of concern that he wants to cut a deal with our rivals,\" Wright noted.\n\nMichael Pregent, former intelligence advisor to Iraq war commander general David Petraeus and a fellow of the Hudson Institute, called the speech \"disjointed.\" And he expressed concern over the presence of Khalilzad, recent author of an op-ed entitled The Neoconservative Case For Negotiating With Iran.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

That boosted shares of France's Total and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell, among others.\n\nIn the US, the Dow and S&P 500 also finished in positive territory after the Fed signalled that it was less worried about international economic and market problems than in March as it kept interest rates unchanged.\n\nBut the tech-rich Nasdaq was an outlier, falling 0.5 per cent after Apple plunged 6.4 per cent on its first ever decline in iPhone sales.\n\nApple, the world's biggest company by market capitalization, also reported its first decline in quarterly revenues since 2003 and a nearly 23 per cent drop in fiscal second-quarter earnings to US$10.5 billion.\n\nApple's weak results hit Asian firms that provide parts for the firm's gadgets.\n\nIn Tokyo, Japan Display fell almost one per cent, Alps Electric shed 1.8 per cent and Taiyo Yuden was off 1.5 per cent.\n\nBut the broader market reaction showed that Apple's travails were seen as \"being more company-specific in nature\" than a general economic issue, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.\n\n\"Apple's current shortcomings are a by-product of tough comparisons, high expectations rooted in past success, the company running headlong into the law of large numbers, and the absence of a new form factor to excite the masses.\"\n\nAnalysts disagreed about what the Fed's statement implied about future interest rate increases, a key question for global markets.\n\nIn March the Fed policy statement highlighted worries about global economic weakness, saying international economic and financial developments \"pose risks.\"\n\nIn the new outlook, it simply said that it would continue \"to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.\"\n\nSome analysts took that as a sign the US central bank is willing to raise rates at its June 14-15 meeting, despite the possible financial market disruptions that could result from the June 23 vote in Britain on breaking from the European Union, Brexit.\n\n\"The more positive tone than in March is consistent with officials tightening again as soon as the June meeting, but only if the data and markets are supportive. We expect they will be supportive,\" said Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics.\n\nBut David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors, said the likelihood of a rate hike in June \"was zero or virtually zero\" given that the Fed still pointed to economic problems, such as inflation rates well below the US central bank's targeted level.\n\nAttention will turn Thursday to the Bank of Japan's policy meeting.

One pouch obtained by Reuters was designed to be worn like a concealed gun holster, with an elasticated band across the chest that pulls the card close to the wearer's heart.\n\nParty members are also obliged to attend Wednesday lectures after work, said Seo Jae Pyoung, who belonged to the Party before leaving North Korea in 2001 and maintains regular contact with sources inside the country.\n\nThe lectures have become more strictly controlled under Kim, he said, with a campaign under way to mobilise people ahead of next week's Congress. Kim used the Party's 70th anniversary last year to promise to introduce a \"people-first\" politics.\n\nOnce a regular event, the Workers' Party Congress was last held in 1980.\n\nSome Pyongyang-watchers take the meeting as a sign that young leader Kim is transforming a country his father Kim Jong Il ruled through back-channel dealings into a more \"normal\"state, where formal Party processes are ingrained.\n\nBut defectors and academics say the importance of membership has dwindled since the devastating famine of the 1990s, which paved the way for a bottom-up and informal network of markets that now provides for most North Koreans in place of the state.\n\n\"The difference between being a Party member or non-member used to be the difference between being treated like a human or not,\" said Mr Seo, who works with defectors in South Korea. \"The pride people got from being a member of the Party has weakened. People only care about money now.\"\n\nMONEY AND POWER\n\nNo data on party membership in North Korea is available, although estimates have put the number at between 3 million and 4 million out of a population of roughly 25 million.\n\nParty membership used to be the key to better jobs and status in North Korea, defectors said.\n\nObtaining a coveted place in the hierarchy often entailed shows of loyalty, such as cleaning the areas around statues of Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, the current leader's grandfather and founder of the state, or planting flowers at revolutionary or historical sites.\n\nFor the few at the top, membership can now be a route to riches as, fearful of losing its traditional grip over society, a Party that still officially espouses a Soviet-style command economy is starting to embrace the market.\n\n\"At the top end of the economic scale, Party people are among those making the most money - using their political connections to get access to resources,\" said Christopher Green, a researcher at Leiden University, in the Netherlands, specialising in North Korea's economy.\n\nBut for the majority, getting on in private business is more important than working your way up the Party ladder.\n\nOne defector who was a doctor and Party member in North Korea and arrived in Seoul in 2014, said medics at the Party-controlled hospital where he worked were not formally paid, but received bribes for treating patients.\n\nHe supplemented that income by trading small electronics and jewellery smuggled from China in his off-hours, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"At hospitals, doctors work out their shifts so half of them can go out to sell things, and half can stay to treat patients,\"he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/6b5f21fb773eb60401c0e8777ee5c238b0aeebf26928c030cd5b2ffdb56a8177?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}]}

The number of properties in active foreclosure declined by 24,000 to 631,000 in March, according to Black Knight Financial Services. That's the lowest since October 2007. Neighbourhoods across the country were in the coming years flooded with more than 2 million notices from banks.\n\nThe wave of foreclosures crested in 2010 when banks seized a record 1.2 million properties and served even more with notices of default, auction or repossession. People suffering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression just \"mailed their keys to the banks and just said 'take it',\" said Ben Graboske, a chief technology officer at Black Knight.\n\nThe huge inventory of foreclosures has taken years for lenders and borrowers to work through. \"We are finally getting back to a very clean slate,\" Mr Graboske said.\n\nWith incomes slowly rising and unemployment claims the lowest since the 1970s, more borrowers are staying current with their payments. Delinquencies on home loans across the country fell to 4.08 per cent in March, the lowest since March 2007, according to Black Knight.\n\nThe most recent data suggests that the country has put its crisis-era foreclosures behind it, said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer of United Nations Federal Credit Union.\n\nHousing markets nationwide have been marked by an uneven recovery, but the pace of improvement has generally been positive, said Mr Sullivan. In some cases home prices have appreciated so much that further increases may be \"unwelcomed\" as higher home values put off potential first-time home-shoppers, he said.\n\nThe reduction in late payments and foreclosures is allowing some of the country's biggest banks to further cut resources at units that specialise in handling delinquent borrowers.\n\nWells Fargo & Co, the largest US mortgage lender, announced the elimination of about 250 positions last week as lenders scale back groups that deal with delinquencies, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified citing lack of authorisation to speak publicly. The Charlotte Observer reported the job cuts last week.\n\nThough the data suggests that the recovery is well under way, the country's housing markets \"still have a ways to go\", said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at real estate data provider CoreLogic. While most foreclosure or distress metrics are the lowest in nine years, they are still above the late 1990s when the market was \"last normal\", he said.\n\nHome sales in the US unexpectedly declined for a third month in March, falling 1.5 per cent to an annualised rate of 511,000 units, a Commerce Department report showed on Monday. The figures were the latest to show uneven progress in March and a laboured start to the housing industry's busiest selling period of the year.

The developer had previously sold about 86 per cent of the 210 released units at private events held for registered prospects.\n\nIn September last year, KepLand said home buyers had picked up more than 80 per cent of the first 160 units released at its closed-door sales at an average price of S$1,900 per square foot (psf) after discount.\n\nThe developer had previously given an indicative price of S$2,000 psf for homes in the 99-year-leasehold condominium, which is located within walking distance from Tiong Bahru MRT Station.\n\nAt the upcoming launch, pricing for a one-bedroom unit is S$1 million, for a two-bedroom unit about S$1.4 million, for a three-bedroom unit about S$2 million and for a four-bedroom unit about S$2.4 million, according to a KepLand spokesman.\n\nHighline Residences comprises 500 one-bedroom to four-bedroom homes, dual-key apartments as well as penthouses. They are spread across three residential towers and four low-rise blocks.\n\nThe project's unit sizes range 506 sq ft for one-bedders to 1,227 sq ft for four-bedroom dual-key units. There will also be six penthouses ranging in sizes from 2,174 sq ft to 2,260 sq ft.\n\nJoseph Tan, executive director, residential services, CBRE said: \"Highline Residences has a compelling investment story for investors who want to leverage rental and capital appreciation. The project's close connectivity to transport nodes and a whole web of amenities in a mature enclave presents strong fundamentals for future growth.\"\n\nThe project is designed by Mok Wei Wei of W Architects and features an elevated green ridge on level five which spans 180 metres with a wide range of recreational and communal facilities. This was inspired by New York City's High Line, a public park built on a historic elevated rail line.\n\nFuture residents at Highline Residences can also look forward to privileged membership and personalised concierge services. These include limousine and housekeeping services, and complimentary golfing at Ria Bintan Golf Club in Indonesia and privileged access to KepLand's golf courses in China.\n\nBernard Lee, director (business & research) at Huttons Asia, noted that the rental market in Tiong Bahru is resilient due to its low supply.\n\nHe added: \"Rental rates achieved are generally stronger compared to other locations. This could be also attributed to the unique heritage neighbourhood that expatriate tenants enjoy living in.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Aspial Corporation announced that its 50 per cent owned Urban Vista has obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and that its wholly owned Waterfront @ Faber project has been fully sold.\n\nUpon obtaining TOP, Certificate of Statutory Completion and Subsidiary Strata Certificate of Title of Urban Vista, Aspial expects to receive approximately S$100 million cash in the coming months; this will go towards repayment of its bonds due in July 2016 and January 2017.\n\nAspial added that it has further locked in S$275 million of sales revenue from its Waterfront @ Faber project. The group expects to start receiving cash flow when the project receives TOP, expected to be in H1 2017.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Polls conducted on behalf of the eurosceptic Bruges Group think tank have found that, given a choice between remaining in the EU or rejoining the European Free Trade Association (Efta), there is a clear majority for the latter - in other words, confining the UK's EU relationship purely to trade.\n\nThis makes far more sense than adopting Prime Minister David Cameron's February EU deal, which achieved nothing of substance. A vote to remain would still leave the UK an unenthusiastic member of a club committed to closer political and economic union. Outside the euro area and the Schengen agreement, we could never have a seat at the EU's top table. In the words of Peter Lilley, the former Conservative minister, we would merely be \"the appendix of Europe\".\n\nThe Efta option is a proven, off-the-shelf alternative. Efta members Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have full access to the EU's single market via the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. This would allay the business community's concerns and allow trade to continue without interruption. While far from ideal for a long-term relationship, it is much better than opponents of such an arrangement pretend.\n\nTake the example of Norway. The country is widely consulted in the framing of EEA-relevant legislation which is what really counts, even if it does not have a vote. An estimated proportion of only 20-30 per cent of total EU law (the so-called acquis) applies to Norway. Some are technical issues relating to trade, such as the order in which ingredients must be labelled on a bottle of ketchup.\n\nNorway is not subject to the Common Agricultural Policy or the Common Fisheries Policy. It cannot be fined by the European Court of Justice if it refuses to implement a directive. It is not liable for the debts of EU institutions. All in all, a much better arrangement than what Mr Cameron is offering us.\n\nSome in the Leave camp have proclaimed that \"we could do better than Norway\". That is possible, but it would take time.\n\nBy leaving the EU, Britain would blaze a pioneering path. A divorce after more than 40 largely unhappy years is not going to be quick and easy. But the Efta route would allow us to make the parting of the ways as smooth and amicable as possible.

Shares of the Calgary-based company fell 9.2 per cent to C$15.93 in Toronto on Tuesday, the biggest daily drop in almost six months.\n\nCNOOC Ltd, Husky's partner in the Liwan development in the South China Sea, warned about lower prices to come, Husky said in releasing its first-quarter earnings results after North American markets closed on Monday. Husky threatened to take legal action if it can't find a solution with the Chinese state-controlled producer, given its Liwan agreement guarantees fixed prices for about another three years.\n\n\"The sanctity of the contract has come into question,\" Nick Lupick, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital Inc in Calgary, said on Tuesday. The potential for lower gas prices at Liwan would have a \"meaningful impact\" on Husky's financial results, he said. \"It seems like CNOOC is trying to use that legislation as a chance to renegotiate.\"\n\nCNOOC buys gas from the Liwan joint venture and resells it to the customer as an agent. A Beijing-based spokeswoman for CNOOC didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Chinese government adjusted gas prices twice last year to stoke demand and shift consumption from coal, which makes up 64 per cent of the country's energy mix. Gas demand expanded 3.3 per cent in 2015, while coal consumption dropped 3.7 per cent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nLast week, China's gas distributors tumbled in Hong Kong trading over regional cuts to transportation fees and prices and the concern that the move may spread to other parts of the country and squeeze margins. While the price cuts last week involved the coastal province of Zhejiang, Husky said that CNOOC told it that a reduction of prices at Liwan would be tied to market changes in Guangdong, another coastal province farther south.\n\nComplicating matters for Husky is that it's also disputing lower payments for its Liwan gas after a pipeline outage within the customer's network earlier this year reduced volumes. A temporary pipeline that was installed can carry less gas, meaning Liwan's sales are down. Husky is pursuing the full payments owed under a take-or-pay contract.\n\nThe discussions with CNOOC over lower prices at Liwan also come as Husky negotiates terms for gas offtake from the expansion of Liuhua 29-1, one of three Liwan fields, and could pose a significant risk to those talks, AltaCorp's Mr Lupick said.\n\nInvestors seem to be prematurely discounting the value of the Liwan project even with the lack of visibility on price, according to Menno Hulshof, an analyst at TD Securities Inc in Calgary. With Tuesday's share selloff, the market appears to be pricing in an assumed reduction of about C$4 per thousand cubic feet of gas to contract prices beyond 2016, \"which in our view is excessively negative\", Mr Hulshof wrote in a research note.\n\nHusky has been bringing in about C$15 per thousand cubic feet at Liwan.

The Fund's April 2016 Global Financial Stability Report looked at the issue from the viewpoint of commercial banks and resulting vulnerabilities, the blog noted.\n\n\"Its analysis suggests that the share of commercial banks' loans to corporates that could potentially be at risk has been rising fast and, although currently at a manageable level, needs to be addressed with urgency. The success in addressing this issue is important for China's economic transition and, given its size and growing global integration, for the world's economy at large,\" it said.\n\nEncouragingly, the report noted, the Chinese authorities have announced they are focusing on the problems of excessive corporate debt and the resulting burden on banks and on the whole economy. Reports suggest that efforts will focus on converting non-performing loans (NPLs) into equity and on securitising NPLs, which involves repackaging bank loans into marketable securities and selling them.\n\nThe IMF's own experience suggests that \"while such techniques can play a role in addressing these problems and have been used successfully by other countries, they are not comprehensive solutions by themselves.\n\n\"Unless they are carefully designed and part of a sound overall framework, they could actually worsen the problem, for example, by allowing 'zombie' firms (non-viable firms that are still operating) to keep going. Banks generally also do not have the expertise to run or restructure a business,\" the IMF said. \"Debt-equity conversions could create conflicts of interest - banks may keep lending to (what would become in effect) a related party.\"\n\nDebt-equity conversions should \"convert debt only of viable firms in the context of operational restructuring plans for the firms (which may include changing management) at fair value and with banks holding the equity for a limited period only\".\n\nNPL securitisation should involve a diversified pool of NPLs with banks keeping some residual financial interest under a legal and operational framework that allows owners of distressed assets to force operational restructuring of firms, it said. \"For these techniques to help address the systemic problem of excessive corporate debt and impaired bank loans more generally, they need to be part of a comprehensive, system-wide plan.\"\n\nSuch a comprehensive plan, the IMF suggested, \"would help allocate resources - labour, capital, and credit - to more productive uses and thus support, together with the right mix of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, China's broader economic rebalancing towards a more sustainable growth model\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The group attributed this to an increase in revenue from the sale of properties during the quarter.\n\nWeighing down on gross margins was the shift in sales mix as the group recognised higher development sales and lower income from its high-margin property financing business. Its property financing business that is operated out of Shanghai yields a 100 per cent gross profit margin since it has no direct costs, as the legal fees, property valuation, entrustment fees are all paid by the borrower.\n\nThe group has taken the first legal mortgage on income-generating commercial real estate or hotel assets in first-tier cities as collateral.\n\nAfter more than four years in property financing, the group encountered the first default of a 170 million yuan (S$35.3 million) loan last December, followed by another default on 470 million yuan of eight related loans disbursed to six different borrowing entities in January this year. Problematic loans account for close to 87 per cent of the loan portfolio, according to First Sponsor.\n\nAs a result, some 84.4 per cent of First Sponsor's first-quarter revenue was derived from the sale of properties, up from 16.7 per cent in Q1 2015; property financing revenue made up a smaller 5.7 per cent of total revenue, down from 68.9 per cent in Q1 2015.\n\nFirst Sponsor has initiated legal action on the problematic loans. For the 170 million yuan problematic loan case, a court hearing was conducted on April 13.\n\nAs for the 470 million yuan problematic loan case, court hearings for some of these default loans have been held but no ruling has been issued to-date.\n\nDuring the first quarter, First Sponsor also recognised a share of profit of S$6.6 million from the disposal of eight non-core properties in the Netherlands.\n\nThese were part of the portfolio of 16 office assets that it acquired with three co-investors in November 2015 for about 205.6 million euros (S$313.9 million).\n\nThe group has, via its 33 per cent owned Dutch associated company, begun its maiden property development project in the Netherlands through the redevelopment of its Boompjes property in Rotterdam.\n\n\"Besides the current property development plan in the Rotterdam residential market, the group is open to further expand its footprint in the property market of the Netherlands and other regions when the right opportunity arises,\" First Sponsor CEO Neo Teck Pheng said. \"In this connection, the group may tap on the debt and equity capital markets to fund this expansion plan.\"\n\nTai Tak Estates holds 44.8 per cent of First Sponsor, while Hong Leong Group Singapore's interest in the company is held through London-listed Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc, which owns a direct 35.6 per cent stake.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tag Heuer, which has agreements with Germany's Bundesliga and Major League Soccer in the US, will be the league's first official time keeper and watch partner.\n\n\"It's probably our biggest sports sponsorship ever,\" Rob Diver, Tag Heuer's managing director for the UK, said at an announcement Tuesday in London.\n\nThe Premier League is in the final weeks of a \u00a340 million per season title sponsorship agreement with Barclays plc. The league last year announced that it had abandoned its traditional set-up and would focus instead on developing a slate of top tier partners, as most professional leagues and events do, including Fifa's World Cup, the National Football League and the Olympics.\n\nSoccer is the \"biggest platform in the world\", Mr Diver said. The agreement, which calls for the watch company's logo to be used in television broadcasts around the world and on the boards that officials use to display substitutions and stoppage time, had been under discussion for about two years. It accelerated after the Premier League announced its new marketing strategy.\n\nBarclays, Nike Inc and Electronic Arts Inc have already signed up to back the league. Premier League managing director Richard Masters said that the aim was to get as many as seven new partners, with another announcement coming soon.\n\nThe Premier League is watched by the largest global audience of any soccer league, and revenues have surged since it started in 1992. The latest three-year domestic and international rights broadcast package that begins next season is valued at about \u00a38.3 billion.

Ceylon sapphires, named after the island's colonial-era name, enjoyed a huge boost five years ago when it was revealed that one formed the centrepiece of the engagement ring Prince William gave Catherine Middleton.\n\nThey are renowned as the best sapphires in the world, but gem traders say artificial stones - coloured glass that to the untrained eye are virtually indistinguishable from sapphires - are being passed off as the real thing to unsuspecting buyers. They fear that is tarnishing the image of the gems, seen as a major potential income stream for an economy still recovering from decades of civil war. \"This is the biggest threat to our industry. Our reputation is at stake,\" said Nissanka Weerasena, who owns a chain of upmarket jewellery stores in Sri Lanka. \"These coloured pieces of glass imported by the kilo are killing the market for gems.\" Stories of buyers getting conned into buying fakes are legion. National Gem and Jewellery Authority chairman Asanka Welagedara recalled how one Australian buyer who spent US$14,000 only discovered that nearly half the stones he had been sold were fakes when he had them tested by the state-run regulator - by which time it was too late.\n\nAnother scam is to heat treat opaque, semi-precious stones to give them the colour and clarity of a real sapphire. \"The technique of heat treating semi-precious stones originated in Thailand, but our people have now perfected the art,\" Mr Welagedara said. \"There is a 10-fold price difference between a heat-treated blue sapphire and a natural stone, so naturally there is a temptation to sell treated stones as natural ones.\"\n\nProblems are particularly common along Sri Lanka's southern coast, a popular tourist draw. \"We are seeing a new trend of cheating, especially along the coastal tourist belt,\" said a senior Sri Lankan police officer.\n\nGeologists say more than four-fifths of Sri Lanka's 65,000 square kilometre land mass could contain underground gems. The best-know mining area is Ratnapura, or the City of Gems, where a stone thought to be the largest blue star sapphire in the world was discovered last year. Blue star sapphires, so called because they reveal a six-line star when placed under light, are particularly sought after. The owner - a Sri Lankan gem dealer who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of being robbed - has valued the stone at US$300 million, although he won't disclose how much he paid for it.\n\nOn the banks of the Kalu river that flows through Ratnapura, hundreds of young men pan for gems, hoping that they too might one day strike it rich. Officially, there are 200,000 miners employed in the industry, but another half a million are believed to be working illegally. Dulgalage Jayatillake acts as a middleman between these small-time miners and the merchants who come to Ratnapura from Colombo and elsewhere in search of gems.\n\nThe Gem and Jewellery Authority says it can't stop the import of artificial stones, which are necessary for the low-end costume jewellery industry. But it is taking steps to prevent fraud by vetting dealers and giving them a stamp of approval that buyers can trust. For a small fee it will issue a certificate of authenticity, which its chairman Mr Welagedara says is the \"best guarantee against fraud\".

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/take-twist-out-death-spiral-convertibles", "site_title": "Take the twist out of 'death spiral' convertibles", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTake the twist out of 'death spiral' convertibles\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Apr 27, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nmagnus energy\n\nFollow\n\nTHE so-called \"death spiral\" convertible bonds that lie at the heart of the proxy battle at Magnus Energy may be a wake-up call for all stakeholders.\n\nRegulators must ensure that the holders of such instruments are not skirting rules about control of a company; independent directors must ensure that disclosures to shareholders are explicit about the risks of such instruments and be transparent about why the bonds are necessary in the first place; and shareholders must learn to recognise death spiral convertibles as bad news.\n\nWhat are death spiral convertibles? In a typical convertible, the conversion price is fixed, which means that the potential dilutive impact of the convertibles is known and limited. In death spiral convertibles, however, the conversion price is based on a formula that assures a discount to market. This not only protects the bondholder against a tanking stock price, but it also creates an increasingly dilutive effect with each round of conversion. When such convertibles are issued in large amounts by a company, or when the conversion prices are set at large discounts to market, the transactions can be devastating for the underlying stock price. Hence the \"death spiral\".\n\nMagnus Energy entered into a deal in 2014 to issue up to S$35 million of such instruments to a little known investment firm called Value Capital Asset Management. In Magnus's case, Value Capital gets to turn the bonds into stock at a 10 per cent discount - the maximum allowable under Singapore rules when conversion prices are not fixed.\n\nA group of Magnus minority shareholders want to stop Magnus from issuing any more of those convertibles. The company has an option to require Value Capital to buy the remaining S$15 million of convertibles not yet issued, and the shareholders want to make sure that the option is not exercised. So they have requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to remove all of the current directors of Magnus and to appoint their own nominees. The shareholders' meeting takes place on Friday.\n\nThe grumbling about the convertibles is not without cause. Value Capital converts some of its bonds into shares many times a week and invariably sells them. The dilution from issuing new shares at a discount plus the selling pressure have weighed heavily on Magnus's share price. Before the convertible deal was announced on Sept 3, 2014, Magnus's shares were trading at the equivalent of 65 Singapore cents, adjusted for a 2015 consolidation. The shares were last traded at 0.2 Singapore cent on Wednesday.\n\nProceeds\n\nDeath spiral convertibles are fundamentally tilted against existing shareholders, but they exist for a reason. Typically, companies that issue such instruments are in urgent need of funds and have few better alternatives, so the convertibles do provide last-resort funds.\n\nBut it is not obvious that Magnus was in such dire straits when it agreed to the convertible deal, or even if it were, whether it is still in that position today.\n\nIn all of its disclosures since 2014, Magnus has consistently declared that it has sufficient working capital for \"present requirements\". Indeed, as at end-December 2015, the company had S$7.4 million of cash and bank deposits.\n\nMagnus has instead used most of the proceeds from the convertible deal to make investments. As at Feb 3, 2016, about S$8.3 million of the S$14.5 million of convertibles issued had been used for strategic investments. The high cost of financing should be considered when analysing the returns on those investments. Magnus may want to reconsider whether it makes sense to use such expensive funds for those purposes. The company's directors should address this point with shareholders.\n\nA new twist in the Magnus saga this week also raises questions about how much control a convertible holder like Value Capital can have over an underlying stock. On Monday, Magnus announced that Malaysian businessman and politician Lee Chin Cheh had bought a 22.14 per cent stake from Value Capital, making him the single largest shareholder of the company overnight from not even being a substantial shareholder previously. Magnus chief executive Luke Ho has said that Mr Lee supports the current board and management, which greatly raises the hurdle for the requisitioning shareholders to succeed in their bid to replace the board and to stop the issuance of further convertibles.\n\nImpact\n\nThat just one transaction by Value Capital could have such a large impact on key shareholder decisions raises questions about whether Value Capital should have been considered a substantial shareholder in the first place. Although Value Capital and Mr Lee have been careful not to cross the 30 per cent trigger for a mandatory general offer for the rest of the company, the fact remains that the convertibles held by Value Capital give it an incredible amount of sway should it choose to exercise its well-in-the-money conversion options.\n\nBy law, option holders are not considered shareholders until they actually exercise their options, but regulators should consider whether existing rules provide enough safeguards for minority investors. The issue is not confined to Magnus. Value Capital has also entered into similar convertible deals with Annica Holdings, ISR Capital and LionGold Corp.\n\nAnother major player in the space, Advance Capital Partners, has offered similar financing deals with Attilan Group (the former Asiasons Capital) and Elektromotive Group. Many of these companies were involved in the 2013 penny stock crash.\n\nSGX head of listing compliance June Sim told The Business Times that convertibles \"are a source of funding available to companies depending on their needs\".\n\nThe listing rules essentially provide protection by making sure that significant issuances receive shareholder approval and that companies provide enough information for shareholders to make an informed decision.\n\nIt may be worth seeing if more can be done. After all, Magnus's shareholders approved the deal two years ago.\n\nLawyer Adrian Chan of Lee & Lee said of such structures in general: \"These 'death spiral' convertibles that force the issuer to take on share price risk rather than the bondholder may be so dilutive to minority shareholders that there may need to be some safeguards built into our regulatory framework to protect the interest of the minorities. Although shareholders have to approve the issuance of such convertibles in the first place, it is doubtful that the real effect and downside risk is completely appreciated by the investors.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If you just rely on technology alone, you can surely get something out of it, but you will not be close to where you should be.\"\n\nWith the implementation of these kiosks, job redeployment and enlargement are in place for Popeyes' restaurant staff. The cashiers can be redeployed as guest relations ambassadors who will greet customers as they come in and help them with the use of the kiosks, among other things.\n\nThe Punggol East outlet is the first of its 16 outlets in Singapore to pilot the use of SOKs.\n\nAccording to Mr Low, the Punggol East outlet has seen a sales improvement of a good 10-15 per cent, especially during rush hours.\n\n\"Labour costs remain the same, but sales have gone up,\" he said. \"Productivity has improved.\"\n\nThe kiosks - available at the outlets at IMM (Jurong) and 313 Somerset (Orchard) besides Punggol East - allow customers to order their meal and customise their preference using a touch screen.\n\nThe order is immediately printed and the meal put together by the counter staff. The entire transaction takes less than a minute.\n\nBefore the change, the average time to take the order and prepare the meal was about two minutes per customer. Now, with the implementation of the SOKs, two orders can be completed in the same period.\n\n\"This is where we are actually able to see our peak-hour sales pick up,\" said Mr Low. Popeyes Singapore is hoping to implement its SOKs at its Jurong Point outlet before the end of next month and its Novena Square 2 outlet by June, thus completing the first phase of its transformation.\n\n\"In the meantime, we are actually consolidating the sixth to the tenth (outlets) of Phase Two. And we definitely want to activate them as soon as possible,\" Mr Low said.\n\nMinister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck inaugurated Popeyes Singapore's SOKs on Wednesday, as guest of honour at an official function at the Punggol East outlet.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That olive branch is expected to cost the Korean company almost US$9 billion upfront.\n\nSamsung is in talks with Apple to be the exclusive supplier of displays for iPhone models scheduled for release next year, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The company would need to spend the money building capacity for the technology, which is thinner, brighter and less draining on the battery than those in most current smartphones.\n\nThe potential deal to supply Apple with OLED screens - first reported by the Maeil Business Newspaper - may help Samsung reverse two years of dwindling smartphone market share, revenue and net income. The consumer-electronics giant in January warned of a gloomy 2016, so locking in Apple may attract Chinese smartphone vendors wanting to upgrade their devices to stay competitive.\n\n\"It looks like a huge investment risk for Samsung at first, but it will pay off handsomely,\" said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities in Seoul. \"Once Apple adopts the new display, others can't help but follow.\"\n\nSubsidiary Samsung Display may spend at least 10 trillion won (S$11.7 billion) beefing up OLED capacity, the Maeil reported, citing sources it didn't identify. Apple sold more than 231 million iPhones last year, and Samsung Display made about three million screens a month. Just to keep pace, Samsung would have to boost production by a factor of at least six.\n\nSamsung Electronics owns 85 per cent of Samsung Display as part of an intricate web of cross-shareholdings in the conglomerate.\n\nSamsung Electronics will report audited first-quarter results on Thursday, including net income and divisional performances. Analysts estimate profit of 4.42 trillion won, or a 2 per cent decline from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nShares of Samsung have risen 3.1 per cent this year after posting three straight annual declines.\n\nSamsung posted better-than-expected preliminary operating profit of 6.6 trillion won on April 7 after releasing its Galaxy S7 phones about a month earlier than usual to capitalise on the lull in new Apple products. First-quarter sales of 49 trillion won slightly exceeded analyst estimates.\n\nIn the past four weeks, eight analysts raised their estimates by an average of 281.1 billion won.\n\n\"It's great news for Samsung,\" Chung Won Suk, a Seoul-based analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co, said of the potential Apple supply deal. \"Samsung will exclusively get the initial orders from Apple in late 2017 for the flagship lines, and it will get the price premium.\"\n\nMaking a multibillion-dollar commitment to Apple hasn't always worked out for suppliers. In 2014, GT Advanced Technologies Inc filed for bankruptcy after it couldn't produce sapphire screens of usable quality for iPhones. Filings by GT Advanced called the terms of its deal with Apple \"onerous\".\n\nSamsung vice-chairman Lee Jae Yong is trying to accelerate a diversification beyond phones, which depend on Google's Android operating system and compete with hundreds of Chinese makers, including Huawei Technologies Co, Xiaomi Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd. The mobile division generated 103.6 trillion won in sales last year - or 52 per cent of Samsung's total, the company said.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales are expected to increase by just 7 per cent this year, the slowest rate in the product's history, according to Gartner Inc. About 150 million users in Asia will delay upgrading in the next three years while they wait for prices to come down, the researcher said.\n\nSales of another key product for Samsung - TVs - declined 0.3 per cent last year and are only expected to grow by 3 per cent this year, helped by the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The sluggish growth is affecting Samsung shares, which have declined about 7 per cent during the past 12 months.\n\nDuring the same period, Apple shares plunged 21 per cent. Sales will fall for a second straight quarter, a forecast that missed analyst estimates, as growth stalls in the smartphone market, the company said on Tuesday. The lower-cost iPhone SE released in March targeted new customers in emerging markets such as China and India.\n\nSamsung gets about 4.8 per cent of its 200.7 trillion won in revenue from supplying Apple, according to Bloomberg data. At least three Samsung Group companies provide the company with displays, memory chips and batteries.\n\nSales of OLED displays should almost double to 21.5 trillion won next year from 11.2 trillion won last year, Peter Yu, a Seoul-based analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said in an April 15 report. Top-of-the-line Galaxy smartphones also should start using the displays next year, Mr Yu wrote in raising his price target on the stock.\n\nSamsung was one of the biggest makers of chips and displays for Apple until the companies started suing each other in 2011 for alleged patent infringements. Samsung invested in a flash-memory factory after Apple said it wanted to switch from hard- disk drives in its iPods. Yet that relationship progressively soured, and Apple depended on alternative suppliers, including LG Display Co, Sharp Corp and Japan Display Inc.\n\nThose rivals have come to depend on work for Apple and in each case are its biggest customer. Apple generates 42 per cent of Japan Display's sales, 31 per cent of LG Display's and 20 per cent of Sharp's, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn 2014, Apple and Samsung dropped all lawsuits against each other outside the US, with Samsung agreeing in December to pay US$548 million. And, last year, Samsung created a standalone team of about 200 employees working exclusively on Apple products, people familiar with the matter have said.

The offshore & marine player said this on Wednesday as it posted a 48.2 per cent year-on-year plunge in first-quarter net profit to S$54.83 million amid sharply lower turnover and gross profit margin. This translated to earnings per share of 2.63 Singapore cents, down from 5.07 Singapore cents.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, turnover fell 29.6 per cent to S$918.43 million, from S$1.3 billion a year earlier, as lower revenue recognition from rig-building projects more than offset higher contributions from floaters and offshore platforms.\n\nGroup gross profit declined 52.3 per cent to S$80.61 million as gross profit margin fell to 8.8 per cent from 13 per cent. Operating profit was 48.1 per cent lower at S$71.73 million.\n\nFinance costs were up by 87.4 per cent at S$17.86 million on higher interest expense from higher bank borrowings.\n\nSembMarine secured S$60 million in new contracts for LNG modules fabrication in Q1 2016. Its net order book year-to-date stands at S$9.7 billion with deliveries and completion stretching until 2020.\n\nSembMarine's chief executive Wong Weng Sun acknowledged during the results briefing the ongoing challenges in the macro-environment facing the O&M sector. \"The upstream oil and gas industry is well into its second year of weak prices and capex cuts following the collapse of oil prices since the second half of 2014,\" Mr Wong said, adding: \"The recent oil price rally appears to be fizzling out and SembMarine maintains its cautious outlook in the midst of such continued volatility and uncertainty.\"\n\nIn the days leading up to the Q1 results briefing, SembMarine has unveiled further updates to the legal proceedings pertaining to two rig-building contracts with Sete Brasil.\n\nSembMarine announced on April 22 that it has commenced arbitration proceedings against various subsidiaries of Sete Brasil after shareholders of Brazilian rig-owning unit of Petrobras approved its proposed bankruptcy filing. Sete Brasil has rig-building contracts valued at US$5.6 billion with SembMarine's yard group.\n\n\"The group has in the last financial year made provisions of S$280 million (in addition to the S$329 million provisions for the Sete Brasil contracts) in case of prolonged deferment or possible cancellation of rigs. We believe that the provisions are sufficient under the present circumstances,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nSembMarine's rig-building subsidiary PPL Shipyard has started arbitration proceedings in April against Marco Polo Drilling (MPD) over a disputed US$214.3 million rig-construction contract. These proceedings are not affected by a stay of action in the High Court to recover amounts due from Marco Polo Marine, MPD's parent and the guarantor of the contract, said SembMarine. PPL will pursue this claim either by way of appeal against the court's stay of action or pursue it through arbitration.\n\nAmidst volatile market conditions, Mr Wong maintained that the yard group would continue to focus on the timely and effective execution of a healthy order book. But he also said the yard group has sought to trim costs by allowing \"natural attrition and removal of less efficient sub-contractors\". Reduction in the present headcounts at Brazil EJA yard is under consideration in light of the latest developments at Sete Brasil. \"We believe our investments in new facilities and capabilities, such as GraviFloat, will enable us to deliver sustainable returns for the group and the shareholders,\" he said.\n\nSembMarine has pressed on with a step-up acquisition to raise its stake in Gravifloat to 56 per cent from 12 per cent. The proprietary technology held by Gravifloat can be applied in the power sector.\n\nSembcorp Marine shares closed at S$1.67, down half a cent, before results were released on Wednesday. Net asset value per share was 122.18 Singapore cents as at March 31 compared to 120.24 Singapore cents as at Dec 31, 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Lane Crawford also sells Korean menswear brands such as Woo Young Mi; it expects to start selling Korean womenswear soon. \"You sense there is a pride about seeing China develop its own creative community and seeing China emerge as a creative force,\" Mr Keith said in an interview on the fringes of the Conde Nast luxury conference in Seoul.\n\nLane Crawford has grown its pool of Chinese labels over the past four years to more than 30, from just four. A fifth of Chinese-designed clothes bought online are shipped to outside China, mainly to Chinese nationals living abroad who want access to these brands, he said.\n\nHe estimates that his average customer in mainland China is aged 25, and those in Hong Kong, between 35 and 40.\n\nAlso high on Asians' shopping list are Japanese brands such as Sacai and Tsumori Chisato, many of them older and better-established than South Korean or Chinese labels. Lady Gaga regularly wears Japan's Roggykei, created in 2006 by two graduates from Osaka College of Design.\n\nSeoul, Tokyo and Shanghai all have fast-expanding fashion weeks sponsored by local industrial groups; these events showcase dozens of budding brands, some of which have moved West and started showing at Milan and Paris fashion weeks and opened shops there.\n\nBeijing-based designer Guo Pei, whose yellow-caped long dress was worn by Rihanna at the Met Gala last year, started showing at Paris Couture week in January; Chinese shoe brand Stella Luna, whose stilettos cost more than 500 euros ($565), has three free-standing shops in Paris.\n\nChinese-born designer Yiqing Yin, whose creations are sold in China, New York and Paris, has won several European fashion awards and been hailed by the international fashion press as one of the most promising designers of her generation.\n\nPopular Korean brand SJYP, run by duo Steve Jung and Yoni Pai, sells in Europe and the United States, including at Selfridges in London and Opening Ceremony in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nChinese-born Uma Wang, a graduate of London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, sells in China and in Europe, including at l'Eclaireur in Paris; she also shows at Milan Fashion week.\n\nLee Seo-hyun, president of Samsung C&T's fashion division and daughter of Samsung Electronics' chairman Lee Kun-hee said: \"Before many Asians thought luxury goods had to come from the West. But they are becoming more sophisticated and discerning and now more people are interested in local designers who have their own point of view and unique style.\"\n\nSamsung C&T, affiliated to Samsung Electronics, maker of Apple rival Galaxy smartphones, is one of the biggest corporate investors in Seoul's up-and-coming fashion scene. Every year, it gives US$100,000 to two or three designers to help them develop their collection; since 2005, it has invested US$2.7 million in 19 design teams through the Samsung Fashion & Design Fund.\n\nSamsung's fashion unit has a stable of brands, ranging from Korean brand Bean Pole to Belgian fashion label Ann Demeulemeester.\n\nHSBC's luxury-goods analyst Erwan Rambourg, author of the book The Bling Dynasty, says Asian brands, even if they are still small and not widely distributed yet, are fast becoming serious competitors for Western brands.\n\nKorean cosmetics have long been popular with Chinese customers and Rambourg notes that popular South Korean television series such as My Love From The Star and Descendents Of The Sun, and Korean pop music acts such as Big Bang and Girls' Generation, have boosted South Korea's image as a trend-setter throughout Asia.\n\nWhile Asian consumers have embraced American culture, Korean pop culture is closer to Chinese culture, says Mr Rambourg.\n\nKim Sung-Joo, one of Korea's most high-profile female entrepreneurs, said: \"Koreans' self-esteem and self-confidence has been boosted by the power of 'K culture' and this is why Korean and other Asian brands have started to become more popular.\"\n\nMs Kim, who owns and runs German luxury leather goods brand MCM, known for its US$700 studded logo-embossed canvas backpacks and who previously developed Gucci's Korean business, also pointed out that Asian brands cater better to Asian women's more petite shape than Western brands.\n\nJoowon Park, director at Seoul-based Simone Fashion Company (which manufactures for Western brands such as Coach, Michael Kors and Kate Spade), said: \"Can we make 'Made in Asia, designed in Asia' become cool? I think yes, we can, because the stigma that Asian brands had is disappearing and we have all the right ingredients and the manufacturing base.\"\n\nAsian brands are also attracting interest from Western buyers.\n\nAwaiting a flight back to Paris at Seoul airport, Maximilien, 39, who works in fashion advertising, bought a US$400 studded bag for his wife from Korean brand Youk Shim Won, with a girl in funky sunglasses painted on one side. \"This is so original, don't you think?\" he said.

Mrs Clinton chided the Republican's penchant for harsh language by saying that \"love trumps hate\". Mr Trump was more bluntly dismissive of Mrs Clinton, saying her appeal boiled down to her gender. \"Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she would get 5 per cent of the vote,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Trump had the more convincing performance on Tuesday: He swept all five primaries, defeating Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Governor John Kasich of Ohio by about 30 percentage points or more. His routs represented a breakthrough: He received more than half the vote in every state, after months of winning most primaries by only pluralities.\n\nThe big night for Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton intensified the aura of inevitability around their nomination bids and created urgent challenges for their rivals. More significant, it increased Mr Trump's chances of avoiding a fight on the floor of the Republican convention in July and of claiming the nomination on the delegates' first ballot. \"When the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you don't have to wait around for a decision,\" he said boastfully at an election-night appearance before supporters at Trump Tower in New York. He added: \"As far as I'm concerned, it's over.\"\n\nMr Cruz and Mr Kasich fared so poorly on Tuesday that together they were likely to win just 10 of the 118 bound delegates up for grabs. Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware also went for Mr Trump, who was on track to bring his total to about 950 of the 1,237 needed to clinch the nomination outright.\n\nMr Cruz is now under growing pressure to beat Mr Trump in Indiana's primary next week, perhaps the last real chance the stop-Trump forces have to halt his march to the nomination. He and Mr Kasich forged an alliance to thwart Mr Trump in Indiana, but it has yet to show signs of working.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders won only the primary in Rhode Island and fell further behind Mrs Clinton in their race to amass 2,383 Democratic delegates to clinch the nomination. Mrs Clinton now has 2,168 delegates, including more than 500 \"superdelegates\", against Mr Sanders's 1,401, with about 1,000 more to be distributed in the 14 remaining nominating races.\n\nMrs Clinton's advisers said that Tuesday's final delegate tally would reveal not if, but when, Mrs Clinton would win the nomination: either in early June, if she continues at her current pace, or as soon as the Kentucky and Oregon primaries on May 17, if she does better than expected in the coming weeks, once her support from more than 500 superdelegates is included. Superdelegates could switch their votes at any point, but Mrs Clinton's are widely considered to be staunch supporters.\n\nMrs Clinton predicted that she would return to Philadelphia this summer for the Democratic convention \"with the most votes and the most pledged delegates\". She pledged to heal the party's wounds after a long nomination fight, telling Sanders supporters that \"there is much more that unites us than divides us\". But she also looked past Mr Sanders to take a swipe at Mr Trump and his campaign motto, \"Make America Great Again\". \"Despite what other candidates say, we believe in the goodness of our people and the greatness of our nation,\" Mrs Clinton said.\n\nMr Sanders, speaking on Tuesday night to an audience of 6,500 people in West Virginia, which votes on May 10, said emphatically that he would stay in the race.

Lower household income and higher costs for credit will weigh on demand for houses at least through mid-2017, the report said.\n\n\"The severity of the ongoing recession will lead to increased payment delays and defaults over the next two years,\" Moody's analysts including Ceres Lisboa and Cristiane Spercel wrote.\n\nBrazil is suffering from a shrinking economy, rising unemployment and inflation that has exceeded the central bank's target for years, damping demand for new houses and making it more difficult for workers to borrow. While the government has used state-owned lenders to bolster credit in an effort to fuel growth, increased concern about the country's fiscal accounts is making that strategy increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nCaixa has tapped into the national workers' social security fund, and sought other, more expensive sources of financing to support mortgage issuance after exhausting the amount it could loan based on the deposits it holds, according to Moody's. As a result, the bank's profitability is shrinking.\n\nCaixa's credit grew at an annual average pace of almost 36 per cent from 2011 to 2014, before easing to about 12 per cent last year, according to the bank's most recent earnings statements. Even after the slowdown, Caixa's lending growth last year was twice as fast as Banco do Brasil SA's 5.9 per cent expansion.\n\n\"Caixa will continue to face the greatest pressure among banks in the system to seek alternative funding sources in support of its loan origination, because the size of its mortgage book already exceeds its savings deposits,\" the Moody's analysts wrote.

This figure includes both official and parallel imports.\n\nBut behind the world's biggest carmaker, Honda is a very close second with 4,012 or a difference of just 153 units.\n\nHonda had also ended 2015 as the runner-up but back then, its volume was only three-quarters of Toyota's and the gap was 4,255 cars.\n\nHonda's strength is solely due to the popularity of the Vezel sub-compact SUV, which is a Japan domestic model offered only by parallel importers (PIs). Authorised Honda distributor Kah Motor sells the export version called the HR-V.\n\nWith the year-to-date tally for the PIs' collective registrations of Vezel at a massive 2,344, the Honda crossover is actually Singapore's most popular model.\n\nBut among authorised distributors, the Toyota Corolla Altis remains numero uno with 1,380 units registered by authorised Toyota distributor Borneo Motors Singapore.\n\nAlso no surprise is that the Mazda3 is No 2 with 754 units sold by agent Trans Eurokars.\n\nIn fact, there is no change to the Top 4 models among authorised distributors from end-2015, with the Nissan Qashqai (724 units) and Nissan Sylphy (414) in third and fourth places respectively.\n\nIn No 5, however, is a new nameplate - the Toyota Wish with 375 units.\n\nIn a reflection of strong demand from replacement buyers, the compact Japanese MPV takes the position formerly occupied by the Mercedes-Benz E-Class executive sedan, which has slipped two spots since end-2015 to No 7 with an estimated 340 units.\n\nIn No 6 is another Mercedes-Benz, the compact C-Class sedan with an estimated 350 units.\n\nAs for the brand rankings, the Top 6 makes are unchanged from last year. Volkswagen, which ended 2015 in seventh position, moves down one spot in Q1 2016. In its place now is Hyundai, which is up two notches.\n\nSubaru has also ascended, from No 10 to No 9, while Mitsubishi enters the Top 10 after finishing 12th last year. On the other hand, Audi has dropped out of the Top 10, to 11th from eighth previously.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG won't fly the jet beyond the reach of its engineers and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA said last week that it expects delays to four Neos due this year.\n\nAirbus's own delivery data suggests it missed handing over as many as 10 A320s in the first quarter, according to Agency Partners analysts Nick Cunningham and Sash Tusa, though the Toulouse, France-based company has pledged to uphold annual rates by boosting Neo production in the second half.\n\nFabrice Bregier, who heads Airbus's jetliner arm, told Bloomberg last week that the setbacks are just \"teething issues\". The reality of the situation should become clearer on Thursday, when the planemaker reports three-month earnings. Things had started so well for Airbus, with the alchemy of reviving a 25-year-old model via the seemingly simple expedient of an engine makeover sparking a rush of deals that has made the Neo its record seller with 4,500 orders. The plan saved the bulk of the US$10 billion or more needed for a clean-paper design, while reducing to bit-part status Bombardier Inc's new C Series model, with which the Canadian company is entering the single-aisle market.\n\nAirbus's great rival Boeing Co had been leaning towards an all-new aircraft to replace its venerable 737 and was also caught on the hop, finally committing to a revamp of its own, the Max, a year later. By then, first-mover advantage had been lost, and Airbus won a 60 per cent share of new single-aisle sales.\n\nOffering Pratt's Geared Turbofan (GTF) on the A320neo, alongside the less radical Leap turbine from the CFM International venture of General Electric Co and France's Safran SA that will solely power the Max, had seemed a good bet.\n\nBoth engines promised a 16 per cent fuel saving, and creating competition between them seemed a sound way of securing those gains. The GTF, which cost Pratt US$10 billion, was also a novel model, using gears to boost efficiency by allowing fan blades to move slower while still shifting large volumes of air.\n\nBombardier - for the C Series - Embraer SA, Russia's Irkut and Mitsubishi of Japan also elected to commission versions of the Pratt engine for their planes.\n\nYet, as the first A320neos were being readied for service entry late last year, word emerged from Pratt that the variant built for the Airbus model was experiencing cooling issues in testing that might require longer start times to be employed in order to prevent blade tips on compressor rotors from rubbing. So-called spool-up times have been set at 350 seconds in hot conditions such as those in the Middle East, rather than the usual 150 seconds. That's enough to affect the number of flights an airline can offer in a day, and its revenue.\n\nQatar Airways, slated as the first operator, refused outright to take an aircraft due in December, with Mr Al Baker giving Pratt until mid-year to provide a fix. In this week's broadside, the CEO said that he could take older 737s as a stopgap and even swap his entire order for the Max once the Boeing jet becomes available. Lufthansa has two planes, but limits them to destinations its technicians can easily reach, potentially ruling out the acceptance of three more A320neos it's due this year. Indian discount carrier Indigo also has three aircraft.\n\nGreg Hayes, CEO of Pratt parent United Technologies Corp, says a hardware fix in late February has stiffened internal components, while software upgrades have pared error messages associated with the cooling problem by 80 per cent.

Another is the move to extend the re-employment age to 67. Dr Yap said bosses should make early adjustments to tap the skills and experience of re-employed workers, while older workers must be ready to learn new skills and take on different jobs.\n\nThe third demographic challenge is the bigger share of professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) in the labour force. These employees are not only better educated, they also have higher expectations.\n\n\"Companies that transform themselves to be innovative and value-creating would be able to create better- quality jobs and careers to attract PMEs to build a strong Singaporean core to sustain their business growth,\" Dr Yap said.\n\nMr Lim said the journey of transformation has already kicked off on three fronts: the drive to churn out jobs of the future to stay competitive; the move to nurture future skills to ensure workers stay employable; and the effort to build careers of the future for Singaporeans to meet their higher aspirations.\n\n\"These are not easy challenges, but we can succeed if every employer learns to value every worker more, and every worker likewise learns to value every job better,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Barclays shares were trading 2.8 per cent higher at 178.9 pence at 0855 GMT, pushing the bank to the top of the FTSE 100 gainers.\n\nBarclays had already indicated on April 5 it expected weak results in investment banking compared to the same period in 2015.\n\n\"This is a relatively clean and good set of numbers against low expectations,\" said analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a note published after the earnings.\n\nBarclays said core units Barclays UK and Barclays Corporate and International performed strongly, with an aggregate 9.9 per cent return on equity, driven by the UK business, which posted a 20.5 per cent standalone return.\n\n\"The core return of 9.9 per cent is very close to the double digits that we have been targeting,\" Mr Staley, who took over the role last December, told reporters.\n\nMr Staley's comments came the day after a top Bank of England official warned investors may have to accept lower bank profits than in the past as they shift to less risky models.\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein warned of tough times ahead, pointing to the potential for a spike in credit card impairments risk, weak investment banking performance and the uncertainty of disposals that Barclays is betting on to shore up its capital.\n\nTotal income at the bank's Consumer, Cards and Payments unit increased 24 per cent to \u00a3917 million, reflecting continued growth in Barclaycard US and Germany.\n\nBarclays' French unit had 1,243 employees and made a loss of \u00a376 million on turnover of \u00a3225 million in 2015, according to company data. Barclays said it would keep the investment banking unit of its French business if a deal goes through.\n\nBarclays' common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell to 11.3 per cent in the first quarter from 11.4 per cent at the end of 2015.

The negotiations were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf a deal goes through - still an if, especially given DreamWorks Animation's chequered history with potential sales and mergers - Comcast would combine the company with its own animation division, Illumination Entertainment, according to these sources.\n\nChristopher Meledandri, the chief executive of Illumination, which has found success in low-cost smash hits such as Despicable Me, would most likely run the operation. That would almost certainly mean the departure of Mr Katzenberg and layoffs at DreamWorks Animation, which is based in Glendale, California.\n\nA spokesman for DreamWorks Animation, home to the Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar movie series, declined to comment. Representatives for Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, could not immediately be reached. A spokeswoman for Universal Pictures declined to comment.\n\nDreamWorks Animation, which was spun off from Steven Spielberg's privately held DreamWorks Studios in 2004, probably drew Comcast's interest as an owner of intellectual property.\n\nAlong with its signature movie franchises, some of which are dormant (such as Shrek), DreamWorks Animation owns a library of older cartoon characters such as Casper the Friendly Ghost though its DreamWorks Classics division.\n\nDreamWorks Animation also supplies television cartoons to buyers such as Netflix and is part owner of AwesomenessTV, a booming online producer and distributor of programming aimed primarily at teenage girls.\n\nIn recent years, as the film business has become more franchise-oriented and as more nimble competitors, notably Illumination, have emerged in the animation field, Mr Katzenberg has pursued various strategies to put his studio on stronger footing.\n\nIn 2014, there was a failed acquisition offer from SoftBank, the telecommunications and Internet giant. A couple of months later, Hasbro and DreamWorks Animation explored a merger, but that effort collapsed after Hasbro's stock price plummeted and a big Hasbro client, the Walt Disney Co, privately expressed displeasure.\n\nMr Katzenberg, who had over the years explored similar arrangements with various entertainment companies, including with Comcast, then decided to go it alone. In January 2015, he laid off roughly 500 employees, or 19 per cent of his staff, and renewed a personal focus on moviemaking.\n\nSo far the results have been mixed.\n\nKung Fu Panda 3, released in January, received positive reviews and took in US$504.4 million worldwide. But analysts expected stronger ticket sales; Kung Fu Panda 2 took in US$665.7 million in 2011. (DreamWorks Animation pays 20th Century Fox a fee to release its films.) Last week, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Co, wrote in a research note that he was concerned about forthcoming DreamWorks Animation movies, including The Boss Baby, which is scheduled for next year.\n\n\"We think that being the 4th or 5th or 6th-best animated studio (behind Disney Feature Animation, Pixar, Illumination, and arguably Blue Sky and/or Warner Bros) is not a good place to be,\" Mr Creutz wrote.

Income available for distribution was 8 per cent higher at S$14.4 million.\n\nThe trust said its total property income for the quarter rose due to income from CyberVale in Chennai and aVance 3 at Hyderabad, which were acquired in March 2015 and July 2015 respectively.\n\nIn addition, positive rental reversions at International Tech Park Chennai and higher occupancy at International Tech Park Bangalore also boosted its income.\n\nThe increase in Indian rupee (INR) terms was in fact greater than in Singapore dollar (SGD) terms, but the SGD appreciated by 5 per cent against the INR over the same period last year.\n\nThe trust said that to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risks, it has increased the percentage of its loans hedged into INR - from 67 per cent a year ago to 73 per cent in the latest quarter.\n\nAll its borrowings are also effectively on a fixed interest rate basis. Its gearing ratio was 26 per cent at end-March 2016. The trust had total effective borrowings of S$345 million at the end of the quarter.\n\nFor the full year, DPU was up 13 per cent to 5.5 cents. Total property income rose 12 per cent to S$144 million, while net property income rose 21 per cent to S$93.7 million.\n\nThe portfolio averaged an occupancy of close to 97 per cent in FY16, versus close to 95 per cent in FY15.\n\nCEO Sanjeev Dasgupta believes the trust is able to capture increased demand from tenants for business space by developing its land banks and acquiring new properties, as India's economy continues its rapid growth.\n\nIn Bangalore, the construction of the 620,000 square feet (sq ft) Victor building is expected to be completed this June. The entire building has been pre-leased.\n\nAt The V in Hyderabad, the trust is developing a 408,000 sq ft multi-tenanted building to cater to expansion demand from existing tenants. While the building is only scheduled for completion in the later part of 2017, it has attained 17 per cent leasing commitment.\n\nUnits of the business trust added one cent or 1.1 per cent to S$0.935 before its results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That brought total first-quarter profits to 1.34 trillion yuan, up 7.4 per cent from a year earlier and improving from a 4.8 per cent rise in the January-February period.\n\nThe data covers large enterprises with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.\n\nThe first-quarter gains were largely led by chemical companies and agricultural and food processing companies, which posted 20.8 per cent and 12.1 per cent growth compared with the same period a year earlier. But heavy industry and mining continued to struggle, with ferrous metal smelting and rolling firms seeing profits fall 15.8 per cent in the quarter and profits for coal miners slumping 92.6 per cent. Oil and gas producers posted a loss.\n\nDebt at Chinese industrial companies increased 5.2 per cent on a yearly basis to 55.22 trillion yuan as at end-March, the bureau said.\n\nChina's economy grew 6.7 per cent in the first quarter this year from a year earlier, its slowest pace in seven years, but better-than-expected consumer, investment and factory data have fuelled hopes that the economy's prolonged downturn may be easing.\n\nStill, analysts are worried that the improvement may be largely driven by companies taking on more debt, raising questions about whether the seeming pick-up in the broader economy can be sustained. Adding to that caution, the statistics bureau warned that profits from investment and non-core activities \"increased dramatically\", and that the rise in profits was not seen across the industrial spectrum.\n\nThe bureau said that 30.5 per cent of industrial profits in March stemmed from investments and non-core activities. \"The pick-up in March industrial profits was partly due to an improving economy, but it was not a balanced and stable recovery,\" NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data. Slowing demand, high inventories and financing difficulties still trouble the sector, he added, and it remains to be seen whether the increase in profits is sustainable.\n\nProducer prices in March fell 4.3 per cent from a year earlier, extending their decline to a full four years, but at a slower rate than a median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 4.6 per cent decline.\n\nEconomists said that the slower fall in producer prices was driven by recovering global commodity prices and also an uptick in construction activity at home.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said at a State Council meeting last week that China will take steps to boost exports, including encouraging banks to boost lending, expanding export credit insurance and raise tax rebates for some firms. Profits at China's state-owned firms fell 13.8 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, though the rate of decline eased slightly from the first two months of the year, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.

What set this talk apart was the speaker: Wang Zhenming, head of the Law Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong.\n\nThis was the first time that an official of the office had ever spoken at the club and, understandably, the room was packed. The speaker, who is also dean of the law faculty of Tsinghua University, spoke candidly. He said that in the first three decades of the People's Republic of China, formed in 1949, politics dominated and there was no rule of law. There were only two laws, the constitution, which was frequently changed, and the marriage law.\n\nThen, from 1979 on, for three more decades, Prof Wang said, economics dominated as the country focused on development.\n\nNow, we are into a third 30-year period and, Prof Wang hopes, this time rule of law will dominate. Today, he said, there are 247 laws on the books and more than 120 bills awaiting action by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.\n\nTo have a complete rule of law mechanism, the legal specialist said, there is a need for at least 1,000 laws, according to his own research, so China still has quite a long way to go.\n\nIn the past, he said, Chinese officials thought that laws were enacted for lawyers and had nothing to do with them. Party secretaries, governors, mayors and county heads studied official documents but spent little time on the law.\n\nThis description of rule of law in China was very heartening, and few would disagree that China should continue to move in this direction. However, it is now 67 years since the People's Republic was proclaimed, and the road ahead is still very long and may well be twisted, judging by the past.\n\nProf Wang also insisted that China was a normal country. It seems to be stretching the meaning of the word \"normal\" to apply that to a country where the ruling Communist Party is above the government and where the military belongs not to the state but to the party.\n\nNonetheless, a recent debate in China between a prominent former diplomat and the chief editor of a leading newspaper does appear to be a sign that China is in some ways turning into a more normal country.\n\nWu Jianmin, former ambassador to France and the retired head of the Foreign Affairs University, gave a speech on March 30 in which, among other things, he criticised Hu Xijin, editor of the nationalistic Global Times newspaper which, he said, \"always publishes articles that are very extreme and narrow-minded\".\n\nIn a talk to students at the university that he used to head, the diplomat said: \"Many people now still have the habitual thought of wars and revolutions, and always think about waging a war.\"\n\nMr Wu said that last year, after listening to a speech given by the editor, he told him: \"Your eyes have not seen the world in a full scope. You failed to see the major developments in this world, and you failed to get hold of the main global trends.\"\n\nTo Mr Wu, the main trends are peace and development rather than the imminence of war.\n\nMr Hu responded with a lengthy post in Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, where he said that Mr Wu's comments were typical of the thinking of \"old-fashioned Chinese diplomats\" who believed that the media's role was only to highlight \"diplomatic achievements\". He said that his paper published reports that sounded more hawkish and struck a different tone from the official line and argued that the Global Times provided \"a platform for diverse voices\" and was \"a positive asset of China's foreign policy\".\n\nThe debate between a hawkish editor and a dovish diplomat caught the imagination of the Chinese public, with thousands of online comments being launched, supporting one side or the other. It also attracted comments from other media channels, including the China Daily.\n\n\"Since diplomacy is essentially an extension of internal affairs,\" an article in the China Daily said, \"public participation in discussions on foreign policy can minimise the opposition against the final outcomes at home. Without people's understanding and support, no foreign policy can be implemented smoothly.\"\n\nThis is true.

They are concerned about jobs, the costs for elderly family members who may be sick, and about how to uplift their children, (especially those) from low-income families,\" he said.\n\nThe father of four is attempting to get elected after coming up short in his maiden attempt in last September's general election (GE), when he was part of the ruling party's five-member team that narrowly lost to the Workers' Party in Aljunied.\n\nAsked by reporters whether he was feeling the strain of being in the spotlight, he replied: \"I don't feel there is any pressure. The way I see it, the focus is on my policies and plans.\"\n\nHe urged voters to \"vote for the PAP, vote for a better home, vote for a better future\" as he pledged to work together with them to make Bukit Batok a \"beautiful place for all of us\".\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Chee, who is making his fifth attempt to get into Parliament, pledged to serve the constituency full time if the residents place their faith in him.\n\nThe 53-year-old secretary-general of the SDP held a press conference at Keming Primary School - the venue for Nomination Day - immediately after campaigning kicked off.\n\nHe tore into Mr Murali's recent proposal to carry out a S$1.9 million Neighbourhood Renewal Programme for a town in Bukit Batok as typical of the \"knee-jerk reaction\" during every election season.\n\nLast Sunday, Mr Murali had introduced various upgrading plans, including a multi-generational park and more covered linkways, but stressed that these could be executed only if he had the mandate from voters.\n\nDr Chee wondered aloud about the status of the S$24 million in upgrading works that David Ong - Bukit Batok's former Member of Parliament who resigned last month - had proposed ahead of last year's GE.\n\n\"Were those just promises to entice voters and then you do something else, or worse, do nothing else after the GE? That must be made clear,\" he said. \"If the PAP was better prepared, why didn't they raise the S$24 million in projects that Mr Ong promised?\"\n\nDr Chee, who wants to make Bukit Batok \"the envy of Singapore\", said his top priority would be to take care of the estate and run the town council in the most productive way possible.\n\nNomination Day didn't pass without a little bit of drama, though. Two other men - former Bukit Batok candidate Kwan Yue Keng and private-hire car driver Shirwin Eu - turned up at the school, raising speculation that one or both of them could get the nod, paving the way for a multi-cornered fight for the ward after all.\n\nMr Eu, 32, was eventually deemed ineligible to contest because he did not have any proposers, seconders or assentors in tow; he was also unable to produce the necessary election deposit of S$13,500.\n\nMr Kwan, who contested the 1988 and 1991 GEs in Bukit Batok on the SDP ticket, told reporters that he was ready to stand in case Dr Chee was disqualified, as he did not want to see the PAP win via a walkover. The 68-year-old, however, did not file his nomination papers in the end.\n\nCampaigning for the by-election will run for nine days until May 5. The following day would be the mandatory cooling-off day; voters will head to one of nine polling stations to cast their ballots on May 7.\n\nMeanwhile, the police announced two sites - the field along Bukit Batok Industrial Park A and the Bukit Gombak Stadium - which can be booked to hold rallies. There were no applications by either the PAP or SDP for the use of either site on Thursday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

IPIT units rose 0.1 Singapore cent to finish at S$0.20 on Wednesday with 8.55 million shares changing hands.\n\nGrapene, which provides consultancy services to companies in construction and real estate development, said its offer was conditional upon it getting enough valid acceptances such that it and its concert parties would control more than 50 per cent of IPIT.\n\nIt \"intends for IPIT to continue its existing business activities and there are no plans to (i) introduce any major changes to the business of IPIT or the operations of any of its subsidiaries, (ii) redeploy any of the fixed assets of IPIT or (iii) discontinue the employment of any of the existing employees of IPIT or its subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of business\", it said.\n\nIt added that if it gets at least 90 per cent of the units it does not already own, it intends to exercise its right to compulsorily acquire the rest and delist IPIT from SGX.\n\nIPIT's sponsor Indiabulls Real Estate, one of India's largest property groups, is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India.\n\nGrapene's share purchase in IPIT came after the trust last week posted a distribution per unit (DPU) of 0.0638 Singapore cent for the 12-month period from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. This was down sharply from a DPU of 0.1396 Singapore cent for the year-ago period. The trust said it pays distributions on a semi-annual basis.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He also singled out consumer lending as a separate threat.\n\n\"The committee is monitoring property markets closely,\" Mr Cunliffe said, according to the text of the speech. \"It has already taken action and would not hesitate to do so again if it is needed to protect financial stability.\" With the UK benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.5 per cent for more than seven years, stability officials are on the front line of the response to housing-market risks. Mr Cunliffe, who sits on both the FPC and the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee said he \"would expect the FPC's attention to risks around property to increase as the credit cycle becomes more established.\"\n\nAmid fears that landlords are pushing up house prices, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has already lifted the stamp-duty tax paid by investors, cut tax breaks and said he'll grant the BOE so-called powers of direction over the buy-to-let market later this year. Last month the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) - the UK's main banking supervisor and part of the central bank - published guidelines to guard against a loosening of underwriting standards on affordability of buy-to-let loans.\n\n\"The FPC's expectation is that the government's changes in stamp duty and mortgage interest tax relief for buy-to-let, together with the PRA's actions, will probably dampen the growth of buy-to-let lending,\" Mr Cunliffe said. Still, \"the impact on the housing market as a whole may not be great\". Since market dynamics are difficult to predict, \"the FPC decided to wait and see how the market reacted before considering whether to take action on buy-to-let\", the deputy governor said.\n\nHe said lending to owner-occupiers at high loan-to-income ratios \"remains significant\" and that the commercial real estate market \"seems to have gone into a deep freeze\" before Britain's June 23 referendum on its European Union membership.\n\nThe current level of household debt \"is still relatively high by historical and international standards and is something that, in my view, the FPC needs to keep carefully in mind when thinking of financial stability,\" Mr Cunliffe said.

On Thursday, the group would officially mark its entry into Singapore with a launch ceremony.\n\n\"We wanted to come together because the international market has just been opened up for us. We're among the first to have started out in the international markets,\" said Dongming director and vice-president Zhang Liucheng, who is also chairman of the federation. \"Many others have no experience, and hence we wanted to share our experience in order to help the other companies grow faster.\"\n\nThis follows reforms in the energy sector in China last year, when the government allowed 20 of the independent refiners - nicknamed \"teapots\" in the industry due to their smaller refining capacities - to import crude oil for the first time. More quotas are expected to be handed out progressively this year.\n\nPreviously, only the state-owned firms such as Sinopec could import crude oil; independent refineries used domestically produced crude oil or imported fuel oil as feedstock.\n\nThe alliance plans to combine the majority of their crude oil purchases through Dongming's Singapore trading office, and could eventually also use the platform for exports of refined fuels - another activity newly allowed by the Chinese government this year.\n\nThe Singapore office, just opened in January last year, would also conduct third-party trades, Mr Zhang told The Business Times in an interview.\n\nDongming, the largest of the independent Chinese refineries, was among the first private refineries to have set up an office in the Republic, an oil trading hub.\n\nTrade promotion agency International Enterprise (IE) Singapore said it has observed increased interest among Chinese privately owned companies to procure crude oil from Singapore, adding that a handful of them have set up offices here in the past year.\n\nThe Chinese players are an important part of the participant network of buyers, sellers and decision makers, said trade promotion group director Amreeta Eng. \"As the Chinese players set up to procure crude here, it is also likely for them to leverage Singapore to market their refined products, and perhaps go into third party trading. This will add to the vibrancy of the marketplace.\"\n\nPacific Commerce (Holdings), Dongming's wholly owned subsidiary here, currently has a headcount of 12-13 staff, including two experienced traders, and plans to expand this to 30 as soon as possible, said Mr Zhang.\n\nThe group had already traded five million tonnes of crude oil last year, chalking up a revenue of US$1.7 billion. This year, it expects to trade about eight to nine million tonnes of oil, which would fetch revenues of above US$3 billion, said Pacific Commerce director Shen Fan.\n\nThe figure excludes oil that would be purchased for the coalition, as operational details for the collaboration are still being ironed out, Mr Fan said.\n\nThe 17 companies have a combined import quota of 60 million tonnes of crude oil and 70 million tonnes of refining capacity, according to Mr Zhang. Besides economies of scale and greater negotiating power, the strong coordination that the coalition would bring could also help to reduce the logistical bottlenecks at ports, Mr Zhang said. As independent oil refineries scrambled to import crude oil, the growing numbers of tankers have resulted in congestion - not just at ports but also subsequently on the roads. The group could look into building a pipeline between the port and the refineries, said Mr Zhang.\n\nMore importantly, importing crude oil through Singapore would allow the independent oil refiners - some of whom had reportedly faced challenges obtaining letters of credit - to secure financing from international banks.\n\n\"Many of the companies have just entered the international market, and their credit lines from the banks aren't sufficient,\" said Mr Zhang, explaining that the refiners typically purchased domestic crude with cash.\n\nPacific Commerce has credit lines with over 20 banks in Singapore, including the three local banks, he said.\n\nGunvor, one of the largest commodity trading companies in the world, welcomed the involvement of international banks in the imports of crude oil by teapot refineries which have traditionally relied on local branches of Chinese banks that might not be familiar with international trading practices.\n\nThe expertise of international banks will help in smoothening trade operations, said managing director of Gunvor Singapore, Yin Dikun. \"This industry needs certain knowledge on common practices of risk control and accurate documentation.\"\n\nThe trader, like many others, is now positioning itself for opportunities arising from the banding together of the teapot refineries.\n\nGunvor has been active in supplying the Chinese market since 2008, said Mr Yin. \"We think the further deregulation of China petroleum market will bring us more opportunities and challenges. We are trying our best to prepare ourselves to face that.\"\n\nThe liberalisation of China's oil market in China is but one development that is creating oil trade flows around the world. The lifting of the crude oil ban in US is another, noted IE Singapore's Ms Eng.\n\nThe increased trade flows will make Singapore even more relevant given its strong marketplace of companies and financiers, she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When asked directly, most investors in American fund firms are critical of CEO pay packages, according to a national Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nAmong respondents, 59 per cent said that chief executives at S&P 500 companies were paid \"too much\", and 56 per cent said that mutual fund firms \"should challenge executive pay more often\". The survey was conducted between March 22 and March 31. It included 1,024 people who said that they invested with one or more of five top asset managers, and 722 people who said that they had at least some understanding of what a fund manager is. It has a credibility interval of about four percentage points.\n\nThe poll results underscore a growing angst over large-company CEO pay, which now runs more than 300 times that of US rank-and-file workers, according to a study by the AFL-CIO, the largest US federation of unions.\n\nMany CEOs at major companies have pay packages worth US$10 million or more.\n\nOne poll participant, Fargo, North Dakota cabdriver Brent Hartz, said that CEO pay is often \"ridiculous\" and worries that managers of funds that he owns - such as the US$50 billion Vanguard Growth Index Fund - are too cozy with corporate chiefs. \"It's almost like they're in cahoots with each other,\" he said.\n\nAsset managers hold about 30 per cent of US corporate stock, giving them great influence over executive compensation and other corporate governance issues. Retail investors have about 89 per cent of the nearly US$16 trillion held in mutual funds, according to trade group Investment Company Institute.\n\nAll of the five large firms - BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments, State Street Corp and T Rowe Price - emphasise that executive pay should be linked to company financial performance. Their voting history, however, shows that they rarely use their ballots to challenge compensation packages for perceived underperformance.\n\nLast year, the firms cast their advisory \"say on pay\" votes in support of senior executives 96 per cent of the time or more at S&P 500 firms, according to research firm Proxy Insight.\n\nThat level of support was typical for recent years, as median pay among S&P 500 CEOs rose to US$11.3 million in 2014 from US$9.4 million in 2010, according to pay consultant Farient Advisors.\n\nBig fund firms are facing more questions about their pay votes. BlackRock faces a shareholder proposal that calls for the world's largest asset manager to report on how it might bring its voting practices in line with its stated support of linking pay and performance. BlackRock calls such a report unnecessary.\n\nBlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said that the firm believes that talking privately with company officials is the best way to address pay issues. Last year, the firm engaged with about 700 US companies and focused on executive compensation matters in 45 per cent of those meetings, he said.

In interviews this year, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter compared the ISIS base in the Middle East to a tumour, demonstrating that the cancer analogy has become embedded in the administration's thinking: \"There are metastases elsewhere - Libya, Afghanistan . . .\"\n\nThe analogy, while sobering, offers a useful way to think about the strategies to challenge the Islamic State. Born as Al-Qaeda in Iraq, AQI, the rebranded movement occupies regions in Syria, Iraq and Libya and is spreading \"cells\" much like a metastasising disease. Extending the metaphor opens the door to looking to cancer treatment protocols themselves - those that eviscerate, starve and immunise - to defeat the international scourge.\n\nWhich to choose from - radical or limited surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors that starve tumours, immunologic techniques or stem-cell infusion to build barriers to cancer rebirth, or several in combination?\n\nWashington's recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan provided less-than-satisfactory outcomes, and that portends low expectations and little tolerance for a repeat of \"invasive surgery\" by the American people. Use of other treatment protocols holds promise, but will ultimately fail unless buttressed by stem cells - infusion of good governance to prevent relapse - and immunotherapies to prevent new ISIS-like cancers from breaking out. Let me elaborate on the analogy:\n\nISIS developed roundabouts - routes for smuggling oil, agricultural produce, phosphate, antiquities and other goods through Turkey to fund the movement. In ISIS-controlled territory, new finances are bolstered by taxation of locals, confiscating properties, kidnappings, extortion, narcotics and sale of goods to the Syrian government.\n\nTogether, these strategies have weakened the Islamic State. But, critically, unless stem-cell and immunological therapies follow, elimination of ISIS or like cancers is a mirage.\n\nUnless this narrative changes - unless the central government halts arbitrary detention of Sunnis and overbearing occupation of liberated communities without granting local populations the right to manage local affairs - the rebuilding of infrastructure that has begun in several communities will not be enough to prevent the cancer's re-emergence. Much as physicians watch over the recovery of cancer patients, international monitors in Iraq could observe and mediate disputes within the liberated areas and between the communities and Baghdad.\n\nSyria presents a more daunting challenge. There is no defined political entity in this region that can be trusted to generate healthy stem cells. Rather, with the country completely broken, the risk of sectarian and political cleansing is ever present. Once the international community arrives at a consensus about Syria's future, international peacekeepers could provide the stem-cell infusion to tap down acrimony, uphold ceasefires and promote local and regional governance.\n\nIn the battle against ISIS, intense efforts at vaccination equivalence are in use today. The US State Department's Center for Global Engagement, recently restructured from the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, produced messaging videos and digital outreach. Al Jazeera and Saudi-owned Al Arabiya use television. The United Arab Emirates established the Sawab Center counter-messaging platform. Like efforts emerged in Malaysia and Indonesia. Britain's Prevent Programme uses social media and informational campaigns directed at schools and universities. Saudi Arabia's Sakinah campaign relies on the Internet.\n\nAnonymous, a loosely associated group of Internet vigilantes, after the Paris bombings applied a \"binding\" approach to take down ISIS Twitter feeds and websites. Twitter itself has taken down 125,000 ISIS-affiliated sites; Facebook and YouTube are stepping up their diligence. France relies on counsellors and others from the Muslim religious community to challenge radical Islamic proselytising in French jails.\n\nUnfortunately, each approach suffers from deficiencies and generates concerns. The success of Washington's Center for Global Engagement for generating thematic campaigns to drive third-party content is uncertain. Arab media send mixed messages, critical of ISIS on the one hand while highlighting sectarian divisions that nourish the terrorist movement on the other, and the Saudi programme instils its own orthodoxy. Commentators call Britain's Prevent insufficient as ISIS continues to recruit in the UK. France's programme to stem radicalisation of Muslims in prison remains a work in progress. All the while, the ISIS Web campaign continues to propagate. In the battle of ideas, immunotherapy cannot give up.\n\nThinking about ISIS as a cancer clarifies the challenges and organises treatment protocols. The strategies proposed here mark a roadmap to defeat ISIS and prevent a relapse. Each element is critical to success. As with the management of the human disease, the task ahead will be difficult. Fortunately, history finds that over time, honing the treatment protocols can win the war against extremism.

Since 2002, it has created opportunities, promoted stability and and made business transactions more predictable, while also enhancing the mutual attractiveness of both markets, he said.\n\nIn Japan to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two sides, the minister also expressed hope that both countries would be able to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement at around the same time.\n\nDr Balakrishnan, speaking to the Singapore media in the Japanese capital, disclosed that a third review of JSEPA was ongoing, and that part of the reason for his visit was to \"catalyse and facilitate\" the review, so that the agreement can be upgraded by the end of the year or early next year.\n\nHe said that Japan and Singapore were confronting the challenge of transforming their economies and the need to keep up with technology, globalisation and the tectonic shifts in Asia - all of which present both challenges and opportunities.\n\nBoth nations are also dealing with low fertility rates, ageing populations and stagnant labour forces, \"so both of us confront the need to improve productivity, retrain and re-equip our workforces and to provide opportunities for our workers in a new technological revolution.\n\n\"The emphasis is on training, on applying technology and applying it in an early and systemically-integrated way in order to derive competitive advantage,\" he said.\n\nCiting an air-services agreement as one area of mutual cooperation, he said: \"We would like to see more flights as well as freedom of flights beyond Japan and beyond Singapore, because we believe that both the airports at Narita and Haneda in Tokyo and Changi (in Singapore) can strengthen their positions as vital air hubs - one in North-east Asia and one in South-east Asia.\"\n\nTurning to the TPP, the trade deal signed among 12 Pacific-Rim countries in February, Dr Balakrishnan remarked that the partnership went far beyond economics, in that it was also \"an icon of the US engagement with the Asia-Pacific as a whole\".\n\nHe added that, as trading nations, Singapore and Japan reaffirmed the importance of the agreement, and shared hope that their major partners such as the US would ratify it early.\n\n\"The TPP is a very ambitious and very broad free-trade agreement, arguably one of the most far-reaching, in terms of its reach to 12 countries (and involving) 40 per cent of (global) GDP (gross domestic product).\n\n\"No one should under-estimate the complexity of this agreement. I think all of us recognise that its significance goes far beyond trade and in such complex negotiations involving quite diverse economies, you are going to win some and lose some.\"\n\nRatification of the agreement will have to be done in each country, he said, noting that Japan had its own issues and sensitivities, which will have to be worked out in its Parliament; Singapore would have to do so as well.\n\nDr Balakrishnan added: \"But I am reasonably confident that in the fullness of time, at the politically right moment, ratification will be possible. Certainly, in the case of Japan and Singapore, I am hoping that by the end of the year or next year, it will get done.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was mainly due to lower occupancies in December 2015 for Penjuru Lane and Pandan Crescent properties, as well as lower contribution from the property at 8 & 10 Tuas Avenue 20 due to \"the fire incident,\" said the industrial landlord.\n\nPlans to redevelop the latter were accelerated following a fire which caused partial damage to the property. AA Reit's insurance fully covered the loss of income caused by the incident, and the reinstatement of the asset.\n\nAA Reit's manager's chief executive officer Koh Wee Lih told The Business Times that the Tuas plot of land is zoned for manufacturing - although that does not rule out tenants who may be seeking a space to store their goods as well.\n\n\"In an ideal world, we would find somebody who has production facilities on the ground floor, and because the second floor's ceiling height is 11m, they can store their goods up there. (It can also) be used for R&D (research & development), or ancillary offices.\n\n\"(We are) making it flexible - to widen our potential tenants that can come into this building.\"\n\nIndeed, AA Reit has said that instead of reinstating the Tuas buildings to their original condition, it will capitalise on the downtime to improve the property's specifications.\n\nFor example, AA Reit plans to build a ramp for the second storey, to make it more easily accessible; previously, the second floor could only be accessed by a cargo lift.\n\n\"We decided it'd better to use the money to upgrade the specs, and make it into a new, contemporary kind of industrial premises,\" added Mr Koh.\n\nMeanwhile, AA Reit said in its earnings statement that some of the vacancies at 27 Penjuru Lane have since been filled. \"Rental contributions will commence after the rent-free fit-out periods,\" it added.\n\nLooking forward, Mr Koh warned that the weak economic climate and industrial oversupply situation in Singapore means that rents will continue to be under pressure.\n\nNoting that the oversupply situation \"is really no secret\", he stressed how AA Reit's focus is to maintain good tenant relationships - something that has helped the landlord in the past.\n\nSaid Mr Koh: \"We're not taking (the challenging conditions) lightly, but we do have some strengths, some good occupancy rates. We can do a better job (and) we do what we can in this kind of market.\"\n\nAA Reit units rose 2.5 Singapore cents to close at S$1.38 on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It cannot last, and rising inflation and the deteriorating economy will eventually take its toll, said Zandile Makhoba, an analyst at real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc in Johannesburg.\n\n\"Retail shouldn't be doing as well as it currently is and that should be concerning us,\" she said. \"A lot of the new developments are in proximity to existing malls, which suggests they'll be competing for the same consumers, who are most likely to be less willing to spend as economic conditions get tighter.\"\n\nThe oversupply of retail properties will probably result in slowing growth or a decline in foot traffic as new malls open before the centres experience an increase in vacancies, Ms Makhoba said.\n\nThe South African Property Owners Association estimates vacancies of less than 3 per cent in the country's malls. Those risks aren't hampering the performance of companies that build and operate shopping centres, which are the best-performing South African Reits this year. Redefine Properties Ltd, which owns the Centurion Mall in Pretoria, leads the pack with a 23 per cent return through Monday's close, while Hyprop Investments Ltd is returning 16 per cent. Attacq and Resilient Reit Ltd have returned 17 per cent and 16 per cent in 2016. That compares with 4.5 per cent for the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index and 7.8 per cent in bonds.\n\n\"Resilient and Hyprop own portfolios of dominant regional and super-regional shopping centres that have historically been among the most defensive during tougher economic times like now,\" said Neil Stuart-Findlay, who helps manage the Cape-Town based Investec Property Equity Fund, which has 5.5 billion rand in assets. \"These centres are typically underpinned by a high proportion of national tenants with solid balance sheets and they often enjoy tenant waiting lists.\"\n\nReits that favour office and industrial space are among the worst performers on the FTSE/JSE SA Listed Property Index, with Emira Property Fund Ltd losing 2.8 per cent, while Investec Property Fund Ltd, which is a separate company to the money manager that Mr Stuart-Findlay works for, has returned 2.1 per cent this year.\n\nSouth Africa has a mall culture where most people living in suburbs shop, dine and go out for the night, mainly because of security concerns. A growing middle class in the continent's second-largest economy combines with the world's highest inequality rating, making it one of the most dangerous countries outside a war zone for incidences of crime such as car hijackings, armed robberies and rape. The current influx of new shopping centres reflects the length of projects and how some developers \"pull the trigger\" at the top of the business cycle and deliver the completed centres in a downturn, said Marvin Nair, head of new business in real estate finance at Standard Bank Group Ltd in Johannesburg.\n\n\"There is retail space oversupply in particular in the metropolitan areas because of the economic downturn,\" Urban Studies partner Dirk Nico Prinsloo said. \"That should subside within two years because of population and potential employment growth.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

But slightly under 39 per cent projected a poorer showing in profitability in Q1 - the gloomiest since early 2014 before oil prices took a nose dive.\n\n\"Looking ahead, while the overall picture for the level of profitability remains positive, the latest results show that fewer respondents now expect further improvements from the record level seen in 2015,\" said the Iata report. \"This reflects downward pressure on yields and ongoing uneven and modest global economic growth prospects.\"\n\nThe cargo industry appears to be having a tougher time than the passenger market. On the passenger side, less than 10 per cent saw a fall in traffic demand in the first quarter, while some 71 per cent expected a pick-up in traffic demand in the coming 12 months.\n\nComparatively, nearly 27 per cent on the freight side saw deteriorating traffic in the first quarter while only 43 per cent project demand growth going forward. This is in line with weak global trade.\n\nMeanwhile, \"lower input costs and increased competition are putting downward pressure on yields, and tie in with expectations of slower profit growth,\" said Iata. Seventy per cent of survey respondents reported a year-on-year decrease in passenger yields in Q1 - the highest proportion in six years - and more than half expect a decline in the coming year too.\n\nIn the cargo market, robust capacity growth continues to put strong downward pressure on cargo yields.\n\nHalf of the survey respondents reported decreases in cargo yields in Q1 and around 46 per cent project yields will keep coming down in the year ahead.\n\nRespondents were also less bullish that costs would continue to ease. Looking ahead, nearly 39 per cent expect costs to come down while some 19 per cent expect them to go up.\n\nIata highlighted: \"Oil prices rallied in the weeks leading up to this quarter's survey. Clearly, the scope for big further gains is reducing.\" In the first quarter, jet fuel - which typically accounts for a third of operating costs for the industry - was down 39 per cent year on year.\n\n\"That said, on balance input costs are still expected to fall over the coming 12 months as fuel hedges continue to roll off and, in some cases, exchange rate dynamics become less of a headwind.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead of funding public services, this tax would be a pure deadweight loss, with no economic benefit.\"\n\nPredictably, economists who favour Brexit disagreed with the analysis, but warnings from the OECD, IMF, the US administration and others are beginning to influence undecided voters.\n\nLatest economic data shows that fears about the outcome of the referendum have already knocked the UK economy: The Office of National Statistics (ONS) calculates that GDP grew by only 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, down from 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Part of the slowdown came from a sharp fall in construction output, which fell 0.9 per cent; industrial output, which includes manufacturing, declined by 0.4 per cent. The service sector, the biggest part of the economy, grew by only 0.6 per cent. Retail sales volumes dropped 1.3 per cent in March, compared with February, a bigger fall than was expected.\n\nDavid Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that the figures confirmed the picture of a weakening UK economy.\n\nThe ONS said it had no evidence for or against the slowdown being linked to the EU referendum on June 23, but economists contend that global uncertainty, combined with referendum uncertainty, has deterred business investment.\n\nThe trend will continue in the second quarter, they predict. Despite the dire warnings, sterling has rallied by almost 5 per cent from its February low against the US dollar, and has improved against the euro; this is the result of the short covering by pound bears, who are betting that the electorate will choose to stay in the EU.\n\nBut the OECD warns that the referendum result is far from certain.\n\nIts 30-page report said: \"Since becoming a member of the European Union (EU) in 1973, GDP per capita in the UK has doubled, outpacing other affluent non-EU, English-speaking countries.\n\n\"Brexit, which would have persistent adverse consequences on economic activity in the UK, would result in negative near-term spillovers elsewhere, particularly in the rest of the EU.\"\n\nThe OECD added that if Brexit comes to pass, Britain would suffer from the loss of unrestricted access to the single market. It would also face new barriers in many of 53 third-country markets if it loses preferential access as a result of leaving the EU. This is possible even if it succeeds in negotiating new trade arrangements with Europe, and trade deals would be cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\n\"An important risk is that capital inflows would be disrupted, leading to a jarring contraction of the UK's record-high current account deficit of 7 per cent of GDP.\"\n\nThe longer-term effects of weaker technical progress, migration and capital caused by Brexit are projected according to three OECD scenarios: optimistic, central and pessimistic.\n\nIn the optimistic projection, the negative impact on GDP is around 2.7 per cent by 2030. In the pessimistic one, it would be more than 7.5 per cent. In the central scenario, UK's GDP would be more than 5 per cent below what would be expected if the country remained in the EU.\n\nThe study also notes that the estimated costs of Brexit do not take into account the fact that remaining in the EU could lead to additional GDP growth, as further development of the single market boosts trade and foreign direct investment.\n\nThe immediate fallout following Brexit would bring about heightened economic uncertainty that would reduce confidence, hold back spending decisions and tighten financial conditions by lifting risk premia, thus increasing the cost of finance and reducing its availability, said the report. A danger is that large capital outflows, or a break in inflows, might threaten the financing of the record-high current account deficit of 7 per cent of GDP.\n\n\"Brexit would generate a financial shock beyond the UK, magnified by the appreciation of other currencies against the sterling.\"\n\nThe OECD claimed that immigration has accounted for half of the UK's GDP growth since 2005, with more than two million jobs created.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The focus therefore rests on its statement, due at 1800 GMT, and any clues it offers as to when interest rates could be hiked again.\n\nTraders said policymakers may be wary of sending too strong a message of an imminent policy tightening, particularly after another batch of disappointing data.\n\n\"There are two major events coming up: the Fed and the BOJ. As far as event risk goes, it doesn't really get much bigger than that,\" said Mizuho's head of hedge fund sales in London, Neil Jones. \"I call this the calm before the storm.\" He said that whatever the BOJ did on Thursday, it would be likely to have a particularly big impact on markets, as there was no consensus on what they were likely to do.\n\nMany investors believe the central bank will announce some form of easing measures, including an increase in purchase of stocks and a cut in interest rates, though they think it could be a close call.\n\nAgainst a basket of major currencies, the US dollar edged down 0.1 per cent to 94.397, leaving it less than one per cent above an eight-month low of 93.627 touched earlier in the month.\n\nThe euro edged up 0.1 per cent to US$1.1314.\n\nThe Australian dollar fell by as much as 1.9 per cent, hitting a nine-day low of US$0.7600 and on track for its biggest one-day fall in three months.\n\nData showed that core inflation unexpectedly slowed to its lowest on record in the first quarter, reviving talk the Reserve Bank of Australia could cut the already record-low 2 per cent cash rate at its May policy meeting next week.\n\n\"The inflation data clearly puts an interest rate cut back on the table quite firmly,\" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley in London.

While the reasons vary - including the long slump in personal computer (PC) sales and slipping prices for online ads - a common theme has been that as these companies have grown into giants, it has become harder and harder to keep up the momentum.\n\nApple's chief executive Tim Cook described the decline as a \"pause\", not a fundamental change in the company's business.\n\n\"This, too, shall pass,\" he said in a call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the results. \"The future of Apple is very bright.\"\n\nBut investors were not so sure. Net income fell 22 per cent to US$10.5 billion, or US$1.90 a share. Apple's results fell well short of Wall Street expectations, and its shares were down as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading. That wiped out about US$47 billion in stock market value.\n\nSales fell faster in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, than in any other region, down 26 per cent compared with the previous year. Sales in mainland China, Apple's second-largest market after the United States, fell 11 per cent as the country struggled with a slowing economy. Apple's prospects there remain uncertain since the government recently shut down Apple's e-book and digital movie services without explanation.\n\nApple's forecast for the current quarter did not make Wall Street more confident. The company projected revenue of US$41 billion to US$43 billion. That is much worse than Wall Street had been predicting.\n\nAmit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that Apple may be entering a period of slowing replacement sales, similar to what happened in the PC market a decade ago.\n\nMr Daryanani also noted that many companies had been hurt by the strong US dollar, which makes American products more expensive overseas. \"It's a common theme across technology companies,\" he added.\n\nMr Cook portrayed the slowdown as part of the normal two-year product cycle of Apple's iPhone. The company's larger iPhone 6 line, introduced in 2014, led to a surge in sales last year as customers upgraded, sending Apple's stock to a record high.\n\n\"If you look at our installed base of iPhones today versus two years ago, it's increased 80 per cent,\" he noted.\n\nApple's newest phone, the 4-inch iPhone SE, went on sale on March 31 - too late to affect the second quarter's results - and Mr Cook said that there was more demand for it than Apple could currently fill.\n\nApple has high hopes for some of its consumer-oriented services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, as well as for its nascent Watch accessory, but those have yet to turn into giant businesses. Apple said first-year sales of the Watch exceeded first-year sales of the original iPhone but declined to provide specific figures.\n\nThe iPad tablet, once a powerful revenue generator for the company, has had disappointing sales in recent years, despite new, larger professional versions. But Mr Cook said iPad sales would improve in the current quarter.\n\nApple still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year. And the company said on Tuesday that it would pass along more of that money to its shareholders. Apple said it would raise its quarterly dividend 10 per cent to 57 cents a share and increase the amount of stock it buys back to US$175 billion.\n\nApple's services segment was one bright spot in the quarter, with revenue up 20 per cent. The company ended the quarter with US$233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\n\n\"When we look at the dynamics of the iPhone business, we feel very good,\" Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said in an interview. Although unit sales were down 16 per cent, \"we continue to draw millions of people that are buying their first smartphone to iPhone.\"\n\nDenny Fish, a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, said on Tuesday that the fund sold some of its position in Apple in the first quarter, citing the company's growth challenges and worries about its position in China.\n\nApple, which is based in Cupertino, California, is expected to introduce other iPhones this year, which could give sales a jolt.\n\nThe company has been embroiled in a well-publicised battle with the federal government over unlocking encrypted iPhones. But Mr Maestri said it had not seen any effect on sales, positive or negative, from the controversy.

Customers today discover new products and services on social media, easily search for alternatives online, compare reviews, and conveniently tweet their feedback to companies, good or bad. The world is the customer's oyster today where choice is concerned and no brand is considered indispensable.\n\nIn tandem, the customers' expectation of brand experience has increased. Customer service is not only 30 per cent more important to consumers than the brand, but also 52 per cent more important than \"value for money\" in driving customer satisfaction, according to recent Twitter research. Customers desire freedom and flexibility in how, where and when they are served, alongside such perks as more personalised experiences and 24/7 availability. This level of personalised service to consumers is only possible if brands up their customer service game and dive deeper into the customer journey.\n\nAs the first place where customers typically share feedback to brands, Twitter is more than familiar with the customer experience desired. How well a business understands the different stages of the customer journey in relation to social media best practices can help springboard it to greater heights.\n\nWhen it comes to creating brand awareness in the media, brands are offered the unique opportunity to cultivate one-to-one-to-many interactions with consumers. This has the benefit of allowing the broader community to form an opinion on a company's offerings or service interaction, and usually in a manner that's both conversational and public.\n\nBefore starting on the task of acquiring potential customers however, it's important to take a step back and think about how one might define the ideal customer service experience: How does a firm want its customers to feel? What should the brand voice sound like?\n\nOnce those questions are in place, the next step is to mine the potential audience for insights that can help better frame customers' needs, and in turn, help refine targeting strategies in the quest to build awareness for the product or service.\n\nWith the right analytics tools in hand, social media channels can afford a wealth of data that brands can leverage to fundamentally shift the economics of proactively engaging customers, yielding new, more targeted opportunities for meeting customer needs. In addition, companies can learn more about their customers than ever before, enabling personalised products and services tailored to each individual, helping to define strategies down the road for converting potential customers into actual paying ones.\n\nBy not shoving products and services in their faces, and instead presenting prospects with genuinely useful information via the many social media channels available, this consistent flow of content can help educate and inform potential customers, gradually building trust in a company's expertise, service or product to help them make purchasing decisions.\n\nThis content can come in the form of industry insight, research and statistical analysis, or even actionable metrics which the prospects can use to finetune their own marketing efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, if a business has been tracking where conversations happen most often with its target customer base, direct and genuine engagement with customers (in a tasteful and personalised manner, of course), can also be used as a way to encourage conversion. For example, Coca Cola's #ShareaCoke campaign involved direct brand engagement with its customers, encouraging them to grab a personalised bottle of Coke, or to share one with friends of the same name.\n\nCustomer service teams are frequently tasked to balance the seemingly impossible: Reduce operating costs and generate revenue, and by the way, do something about customer satisfaction while they are at it.\n\nIn the past, entities such as banks and telecommunications companies have relied on call centres to help manage customer queries in the hopes of converting prospects into sales results. Today however, it's the rare person who's willing to be put on hold for 20 minutes before being transferred from one department to another. Customer service today needs to be instant and responsive, and there is a cost-effective, engaging method to customer service which brands have been slow to embrace - social.\n\nWith the right strategies in place backed by an empowered team, customer service on social media can be transformed from an operating expense to a critical brand asset that directly impacts positive brand image, as the public are watching and forming opinions about a company's brand as they see it supporting its customer in a personal, effective manner, all in real-time. Apple, for example, recently got in on the act by setting up shop on Twitter for customer support, using the handle @AppleSupport. Providing tips, tricks and other helpful information aside from answering customer queries, the @AppleSupport account has been a raging success so far, with more than 209,000 followers, and 18,300 tweets.\n\nFor some, social media serves as an early warning system; T-Mobile, for example, found that a change in its service offering suddenly spiked negative sentiment on Twitter from 1 to 3 per cent, all the way to 37 per cent. This pulse-check was fed back into the organisation, and the company's CEO, John Legere, was able to quickly tweet a response which brought sentiment back to normal levels.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that dedicated social media customer service teams can serve as the \"voice of the customer\" within the larger organisation and share transformative insight. This insight can then be used to help make informed decisions to help drive future plans.\n\nAll in all, the more thoroughly a company gains understanding of the customer journey, the better it will be able to frame its priorities. The value of social media goes beyond using these services as broadcast channels or customer support avenues, but instead provides a real-time pulse on customers' behaviours, attitudes and needs. Now, a firm can know and serve the people most important to it like never before.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

One must feel for its senior management and crisis communications team as they tackle one mishap after another.\n\nA power fault was the cause of a major breakdown of train services on three MRT lines and one LRT line on Monday evening. This was the first time so many lines were down at the same time, stranding thousands of commuters during one of the busiest travel times of the day. The trip caused blackouts and cut off the air-conditioning at the affected stations, which also lost power except for emergency lighting.\n\nThe North-South and East-West lines were disrupted for about half an hour, and the Circle Line for about an hour. It was worse for those wanting to ride the Bukit Panjang LRT, as trains started moving again only after a more than two-hour delay.\n\nThings didn't get much better on Tuesday morning, when a traction power fault halted train services between Kranji and Woodlands MRT stations on the North-South line. This was the line's third stoppage in a week.\n\nMonday's disruptions occurred just hours after SMRT announced the findings of an investigation into the deaths of two of its staff last month. The operator said that a failure to follow proper safety measures before allowing the work team to get onto the train tracks had directly caused the tragedy. The safety lapses included not providing early warnings to the work team.\n\nIt's worth noting that Singapore - with a vehicle population of one million and nearing its peak - is already taking baby steps towards becoming a car-lite society, and encouraging more people to take buses and trains as their main mode of getting around. As Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan put it recently, a car-dominant model is unsustainable given Singapore's land constraints, and he hopes Singaporeans will eventually cherish public transport as an indispensable part of their daily lives.\n\nBut for that to happen, there must be an excellent public transport system - dependable and convenient. So commuters are naturally aggrieved that the train network's reliability has once again been called into question. There should be greater transparency and clarity when it comes to explaining the reasons behind a disruption, as well as the specific measures taken to rectify the identified faults.\n\nMr Khaw's recent announcement in Parliament that the government will invest heavily in preventive maintenance as well as hardware replacement and upgrading is welcome; this week's breakdowns only serve to heighten the sense of urgency.\n\nThere will invariably be some trade-offs that the public will have to accept along the way. Mr Khaw has called for commuters to allow operators to open some of the MRT lines slightly later in the morning (or to shut them earlier at night) in order to give engineers more time to perform necessary maintenance and upgrading.\n\nAnother crucial task at hand is to win back the public's trust and confidence. Those affected by the breakdowns can get refunds within a 14-day period at any train station, but there have been calls for more compensation. For instance, some bemoaned the fact that they had no choice but to take a taxi during the peak period because of the disruptions - with fares costing many times more than a train trip. After a lengthy disruption, a move to offer free train rides to all (perhaps for a day or two) is a small investment that could pay big dividends for SMRT: the goodwill earned from commuters would go a long way towards repairing the corporation's battered reputation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of 0.5 per cent.\n\nSteady hiring and borrowing costs still close to record lows are conducive to purchases, especially at the entry level part of the market. The advance in pending sales in March helps lay the ground for a pickup in demand for previously owned properties in coming months, sustaining the housing rebound.\n\n\"Despite supply deficiencies in plenty of areas, contract activity was fairly strong in a majority of markets,\" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.\n\n\"This spring's surprisingly low mortgage rates are easing some of the affordability pressures potential buyers are experiencing and are taking away some of the sting from home prices that are still rising too fast and above wage growth.\"\n\nEstimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from a drop of 1.5 per cent to a rise of 2 per cent. The Realtors' group previously reported the February reading as a 3.5 per cent gain.\n\nThree of four regions saw an increase, the report showed. That included a 3.2 per cent advance in the Northeast, a 3 per cent pickup in the South and a 0.2 per cent gain in the Midwest. Pending purchases fell 1.8 per cent in the West.\n\nCompared with a year earlier, the index increased 2.9 per cent on an unadjusted basis, after a 5 per cent gain in the prior 12-month period. It was projected to climb 0.8 per cent, according to the Bloomberg survey median.\n\nThe pending sales gauge was 110.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest since May of last year. A reading of 100 corresponds to the average level of contract activity in 2001, or \"historically healthy\" home-buying traffic, according to the NAR.\n\nEconomists consider pending sales a leading indicator because they track contract signings. Purchases of previously owned homes are tabulated when a deal closes, typically a month or two later.\n\nResales make up more than 90 per cent of the housing market, with new-house purchases accounting for the rest. Recent figures were mixed. Sales of existing dwellings rose more than projected in March.

Such an esoteric subject may not generally attract intense interest, but when Canada's new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is involved, these things have a tendency to go viral.\n\nMr Trudeau has become a digital star many times over since his election in October. Videos of the leader explaining his brand of feminism or hugging baby pandas have become a near-weekly staple of social media feeds.\n\nThe clip of Mr Trudeau, 44, excitedly breaking down quantum computing during a visit to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, this month prompted admiring write-ups from both Canadian and American news media outlets.\n\nThe Toronto Star: \"The man who has been called Canada's new heart-throb, yoga hotshot, feminist PM - apparently eager to show he's more than a now globally recognised pretty face - promptly showed he has computer-geek talents previously little known.\" The Washington Post: \"The Internet's love of Justin Trudeau knows no bounds. And it grows greater still.\" Writing in the Canadian news magazine Maclean's last month, political analyst Evan Solomon called the prime minister \"our first 'Viral PM', creating political 'moments' specifically so they become shareable\". Mr Solomon also compared Mr Trudeau's political skills to those of Donald Trump: \"If Trump has taught the world anything, it is that celebrity is a political currency that is valued very highly. Trudeau's image isn't a two-bit coin; it's political bullion.\" Experts say that politicians such as Mr Trudeau, Mr Trump and President Barack Obama have been ahead of the curve in harnessing social media's paradigm-changing power. Their ability to shine in bite-size media is reminiscent of John F Kennedy's prowess compared with Richard Nixon's in the first televised presidential debate in 1960. And tools including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have given these politicians a significant portion of control in disseminating their own messages.\n\nLaura Olin, who ran social media strategy for the Obama campaign in 2012, said that politicians' most viral moments have become so easy to identify that \"at this point the digital media company machine has learned to do a lot of this work for social media campaigners\". \"It is another way of showing that politicians who are able to act like normal human beings are the ones who are going to attract mass followings,\" she added.\n\nMr Trudeau and his Liberal Party's digital fluency during the election helped them attract the support of an unusually large group of young voters. A study commissioned by a students' association and released last week by the Canadian public opinion firm Abacus Data found that voter turnout among 18 to 25-year-olds \"likely increased by about 12 points in 2015,\" and that 66 per cent of young Canadians said they could relate to Mr Trudeau.\n\nAbacus' chief executive, David Coletto, said that the Liberals understood social media and that Mr Trudeau understood it \"unlike any leader we've had in Canada\". Mr Trudeau's political opposition has not taken kindly to his online success, criticising the prime minister as superficial. His answer on quantum computing was used as fodder for a Conservative Facebook video, which claimed that he had staged the moment to avoid answering a question about fighting terrorism.\n\n\"Sorry, Mr Trudeau. Serious questions need serious answers,\" the ad said.\n\nSome digital outlets have also been critical of the quantum computing video. Gawker suggested in a headline that it was most \"likely staged\". The Washington Post quibbled that the explanation \"was actually not quite right\".\n\nA spokesman for the prime minister, Cameron Ahmad, rejected any suggestion that occasions like the one on quantum computing were staged purely for the purposes of publicity. He also pointed out that Mr Trudeau had returned to answer the reporter's question about terrorism at length after tackling quantum computing.

However, should the Fed continue to paint a 'cautious and data dependent' approach, the USD will stay pressured and the Singapore equity market is likely to remain buoyant despite the uninspiring Q1 corporate results season,\" DBS Group Research said in a monthly strategy report on April 26.\n\n\"STI now trades at slightly above the 12.09x (-1SD) FY16/FY17 PE level of 2900. Further upside for the STI beyond 2965 is hard to justify unless the USD/SGD continues its decline. Furthermore, stock prices could pull back with many stocks going XD (ex-dividend) soon. Upside looks limited, another pullback looks due. We peg a range of 2800 to 2965 till end-May with support along the way at about 2860.\"\n\nA retreat in large caps such as the three local banks and telco Singtel did weigh down the STI on Wednesday, with part of the index's drop having to do with some stocks going ex-dividend. The biggest lagger in the basket was UOB, which fell 51 Singapore cents or 2.6 per cent to S$18.88 after going ex-dividend.\n\nBut Singtel, which did not go ex-dividend on Wednesday, was the next largest drag on the STI, shedding eight Singapore cents or 2 per cent to finish the session at S$3.85. The telco made it to the top 10 actives list on the local bourse, with 18.5 million shares changing hands.\n\nThe drop in Singtel shares came despite a \"buy\" maintained by Nomura on Wednesday, in a report that raised the possibility of two large initial public offerings (IPOs) from Singtel over the next few years.\n\n\"NetLink Trust (NLT) divestment is a definite we think - it could be worth around S$3 billion we estimate, which suggests up to 14 Singapore cents can be returned to shareholders via special dividends - hence total yield in FY18F could be as much as 10 per cent,\" the brokerage said.\n\n\"There is a small possibility of an Optus IPO too - but it is not as straightforward, in our view. Optus' EV (enterprise value) is S$18 billion on our forecasts. We think Singtel will remain M&A active.\"\n\nNomura has a S$4.25 target price for Singtel.\n\nAmong second-liners, energy-related stocks were in heavy play. The most actively traded counter was Catalist-listed Resources Prima Group, which fell S$0.011 to S$0.036 with 76.8 million shares changing hands. Other actives included less commonly seen IEV Holdings and familiar name Ezra Holdings.\n\nDBS Group Research said in its report: \"Our technical view for Brent is a pullback to about US$37 per barrel before another up move to US$55 per barrel before year-end. We look to selectively accumulate O&M (offshore and marine) stocks on Brent pullback, our picks are Sembcorp Industries and Ezion.\"\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In Lord Adair Turner's case, that subversion of orthodoxy applies twofold. A former banker and chief of the UK's Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner is part of a movement that reckons with prevailing economics orthodoxy, and finds it wanting. As an establishment figure seeking a post-crisis economics, he is by no means alone. But as the most prominent proponent of \"helicopter money\" - that central banks should print money to fund government deficits - he is a heretic among heretics.\n\nYet to judge Lord Turner's most radical, \"devilish\" proposal shorn of its argumentation would not do the book justice. In fact, while his conclusions are heterodox, Lord Turner arrives at them via surprisingly standard analysis. Following Raghuram Rajan and others, he argues that financialisation has not been \"axiomatically beneficial\" for economies anywhere. Instead, finance is ridden with what John Cassidy terms \"rational irrationality\": what is individually optimal makes the system less efficient and more volatile. At first glance, Lord Turner's account of the global financial crisis would not seem out of place in Martin Wolf's classic The Shifts and The Shocks. Nor would some of his recommendations: stricter capital requirements; regulating collateralised debt obligations, credit default swaps and other forms of \"shadow banking\"; and fragmenting big banks. So far, so standard.\n\nWhere Lord Turner deviates from his post-crisis peers is his thesis that debt is the ultimate cause of financial boom and bust. Tracing intellectual and economic history from Aristotle to Irving Fisher, he argues that the fixed nature of debt is a double-edged sword. By providing lenders security, debt allows the mobilisation of capital. Then prices rise, making more capital available. But virtuous cycles can turn vicious: repayments are fixed only until a default occurs. When lenders sense imminent defaults, they can fall in thrall to animal spirits and withdraw credit en masse, leading to \"sudden stops\". Debt that finances existing assets, such as real estate, is even more vulnerable because it generates no new incomes, leading to \"supercharged\" credit cycles. Knock-on effects on prices can prompt more defaults, and spiral into what Mr Fisher calls \"debt deflation\", as the world saw in 2008.\n\nLord Turner's writing is a distinct analysis of financial crises, and implies a distinct policy. The specific failures of banks, for instance, can only make the fundamental volatility of debt worse. Analysts who narrowly pin the crisis on \"bad lending\" in the subprime mortgage chain miss the forest for the trees.\n\nAs Lord Turner puts it: \"Even good lending can be bad.\" Yet, while he views addressing market failures as a distraction, he is reluctant to recommend direct remedies to \"debt pollution\". Central banks should target private sector leverage in addition to targeting inflation, but as he admits, \"there is no science\" to determine the optimum. He deems other options, such as taxing debt and abolishing banks, too extreme. Lord Turner faces the same dilemma about credit that Mr Wolf and others face in addressing inherent failures in finance. As he explains: \"The most fundamental problems . . . are created not by activities that we would quite happily see disappear entirely, but by activities . . . which in moderate amounts are clearly valuable, but on an excessive scale can cause economic disaster.\"\n\nLord Turner should be commended for eschewing easy solutions. Yet because of this dilemma, his toolkit for preventing crises ends up looking very similar to other authors. By falling back on targeted policies to stem the spread, such as macroprudential restrictions on real estate lenders and borrowers, he ultimately fails to resolve what he identifies as the core issue: debt.\n\nInstead, the radicalism lies where he explains both the crisis and the subsequent recovery, or lack thereof. Debt caused the crisis, and that same debt is now holding up growth. Inspired by Richard Koo's analysis of Japanese stagnation, Lord Turner argues that debtors - firms and households alike - would rather pay off debts than borrow or spend, leading to a \"balance sheet recession\".\n\nHere Lord Turner is on more contentious ground. Feeble demand for credit is far from the only explanation for a weak recovery: initially, governments sought to ensure a steady credit supply; now left-wing economists blame austerity; still others point to an ageing population and high savings as a cause of secular stagnation. While Lord Turner's thesis neatly and appealingly explains both crisis and recovery, each may also have different causes.\n\nIf debt is the problem, Lord Turner argues, the obvious response is for the private sector to deleverage. Expansionary fiscal policy seems like an obvious answer, but this only shifts the debt to the public sector, as sovereign debt crises have made clear. Loose monetary policy is less direct, and creates more private debt that could sets the stage for the next crisis. As he puts it, \"all policy levers seem to be blocked\" - all except helicopter money. While mindful of the risk of runaway inflation, he argues that central banks can be constrained to finance deficits in moderation, using a \"dangerous medicine\" only to \"help cure severe illness\".\n\nBut should they? The necessary structure of Lord Turner's argument about recovery leaves it open to critique at every link in the chain. First, each theory about the weak recovery has a corresponding policy recommendation - or recommendations. Quantitative easing, for instance, is the go-to solution if weak credit supply is the problem. Why should proponents of other theories choose helicopter money? Moreover, critics can argue that neither fiscal nor monetary policy is blocked. While stimulus leads to public debt, governments may not have the same incentives and discipline to deleverage as firms and households. And if we adopt the macroprudential policies that Lord Turner favours, the risks of monetary policy sowing the seeds of another crisis are limited.\n\nLord Turner's heretical conclusion, through comprehensive and compelling argumentation, is far less heretical than it at first appears. He relies on standard analysis, and even produces fairly standard recommendations to prevent crises. But by linking crisis to recovery, he has exposed the taboo against printing money as just that - a taboo - and allowed us to consider seriously the money financing of public debt in dire circumstances. And there are some prominent converts. As Mr Wolf, no stranger to the establishment, puts it: \"I fail to see any moral force to the idea that fiat money should only promote private, not public, spending.\" Of course, whether what we can do is what we should do remains to be seen.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Resident unemployment rate and redundancies in some sectors will also creep up.\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower will release on Thursday an advance copy of the labour market report for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.\n\nMAS had first expressed its concerns about the weakening labour market in its April 14 monetary policy statement, but did not list projected figures.\n\nIn the same statement, MAS stunned market-watchers with a shift to a neutral policy stance of zero per cent appreciation of the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) band.\n\nTaken together, the statement and the full review reflected a central bank that is now more guarded in its economic outlook, with the labour market flagged as a rising concern.\n\nMAS noted that cyclical and structural factors have softened labour demand, with overall job gains at 32,300 in 2015, a far cry from 2014's 130,100. Productivity gains has also staved off demand for labour.\n\nOn the supply side, residents who have been laid off are finding it more difficult to re-enter the workforce within six months, with the mismatch in skills listed as a possible factor. Tightening foreign worker policies also capped foreign labour supply growth.\n\nAll these point towards loosening pressure in the labour market.\n\nMAS' labour market pressure indicator - a statistic based on 31 indicators - showed that tightness had eased to 0.33 in H2 2015, from 0.44 in H1.\n\n\"Looking ahead, overall headcount gains will remain modest, alongside a weak cyclical environment, intensifying industry reconfigurations in some sectors and increasing skills mismatches within the resident workforce\", wrote MAS, resulting in softening wage pressures and rising resident unemployment rate.\n\nAll these will affect aggregate demand in the economy, said UOB economist Francis Tan.\n\n\"The key thing is that we all want to survive - workers will spend cautiously because they are scared of being laid off; companies don't want to raise prices because they already are not getting much business. This will put a cap on core inflation,\" he said.\n\nMAS reflected this assessment in its review, saying that projected pick-up in core inflation in 2016 will not likely come from pick-up in aggregate demand.\n\nTo be sure, MAS made it clear that \"the Singapore economy is not expected to experience a recession or widespread price declines\" this year.\n\nBut it now sees core inflation coming in the lower half of the 0.5 to 1.5 per cent forecast range.\n\nUptick in core inflation will, however, be driven by \"smaller price declines in the components of the consumer price index (CPI) basket\", wrote MAS.\n\nAs disinflationary pressures from fiscal measures wear off, and as oil prices start to slowly rise, MAS sees it fit to ease policy stance slightly in mid-April \"to secure medium-term price stability\".\n\nThis latest stance follows recent \"measured steps\" that MAS had taken in January and October 2015, when the slope of the S$NEER band was decreased, it said.\n\nThese three moves can be seen as the central bank tackling weakening imported and domestic inflation, said economists.\n\nWhile some signs of stability in macroeconomic conditions seem to be emerging, observers are still mulling over the next step MAS will take to counter price pressures. Most say a re-centring of the S$NEER band is on the cards should conditions worsen.\n\nA smaller proportion are going into unchartered territory in flirting with the idea of a negative slope.\n\nThis thought is even more poignant now, as the Bank of Japan - one of the handful of central banks to put interest rates at negative - will issue another decision today.\n\nBut such a move will have severe consequences for Singapore's economy and even politics, said Mizuho economist Vishnu Varathan.\n\n\"For the S$NEER slope to go into reverse - it would almost be us conceding that we are into negative productivity, where we are losing competitiveness drastically,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nS'pore sees broader weakening in economic activity\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For example, it has 20 tables in the IT section that can be switched out, to feature more laptops just before the back-to-school period for secondary and tertiary students.\n\nThis also allows the store to cater to larger products, such as speakers and printers when needed, without the need to adjust the display area permanently.\n\nDuring sale periods, areas of the store can be easily cleared out and redesignated as warehousing space to support its Click & Collect business, where consumers can make purchases via the website but pick up the items in stores.\n\nCourts is also moving from sticker-based posters to magnetic panels for in-store displays, to cut down on time spent attaching and removing the posters. This increases productivity as it allows staff to spend more time with customers. The more consumer-focused store will also have product categories stocked by colour codes, and offer more in-store demonstration counters, to better engage an increasing number of savvy consumers who have switched to shopping online.\n\nStan Kim, chief executive officer of Courts Singapore, said: \"This is an important step in the direction Courts is taking to stay relevant amid growing competition, fast-changing shopper preferences and the numerous and varied modes of shopping available today.\"\n\nThis next-generation store is the first of its kind in Singapore, and one of two in the region. Along with the company's upcoming Sri Damansara Megastore makeover in Malaysia, both revamped stores will serve as test beds for the company to gauge consumer interest and feedback, before deciding if it will introduce the changes to more stores across the region.\n\nThe new store design was done by Australia's 25-year-old Greater Group company, which had previously designed Samsung Experience stores in Australia.\n\nWhile Courts has an online store, it also sells items exclusive to its retail stores.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The same unit had a weak quarter at the end of 2015.\n\nThe British oil major does not disclose figures for its energy trading divisions, or give details on its performance.\n\n\"Given the lack of visibility on the repeatability of these profits, we have largely maintained our downstream (refining and trading) earnings estimates,\" said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, without disclosing his estimates.\n\nFrance's Total, whose net adjusted profit beat expectations by US$400 million, also relied on a strong performance by its trading and petrochemicals units, which are equally difficult to read.\n\nStatoil's trading unit suffered from lower margins, it said, but a cost-cutting programme helped the company beat expectations. Underlying production rose by 2 per cent in the first quarter, after adjusting for divestments.\n\nBP's production rose 5.2 per cent, without contribution from Russian oil major Rosneft, in the first three months of the year, mainly due to production sharing agreements (PSAs).\n\nBP has warned production will fall in the second quarter because of fluctuations in PSA payments and planned field maintenance.\n\nAnalysts struggle to predict higher production from PSAs as contributions to oil majors on behalf of national governments differ depending on oil prices.\n\nIn Iraq, companies are being repaid their dollar investments in oil, meaning that during times of high oil prices they get one barrel to compensate for every US$100 of investments, while during times of low prices they can get as many as three barrels.\n\nTotal's production rose 4 per cent in the quarter, equivalent to the target it had set for the full year, said Alexandre Andlauer, analyst at AlphaValue, which means it is unlikely to exceed that in coming quarters.\n\n\"The production surprise is a one-shot in our view but a welcomed one,\" he added.\n\nEuropean oil majors Eni and Shell report first-quarter results on April 29 and May 4, respectively.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

A policy decision statement is due to be released at 2 pm EDT (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Janet Yellen is not scheduled to hold a press conference.\n\nMarkets have turned up since the last rate decision in March. The S&P 500 has risen more than 14 per cent since mid-February. China's economy has also shown more positive signs, growing at a 6.7 per cent pace in the first quarter.\n\nA Reuters poll of more than 80 economists showed expectations were for two rate increases this year, with the possibility the Fed will hike in June.\n\nAdditionally, some of the pressures that have kept inflation lower than the Fed would like have abated. Oil prices have rallied, with the Brent benchmark crude up 20 per cent to around US$44 a barrel since the Fed's December rate hike, while the dollar has dropped around 4 per cent against a basket of currencies during the same period.\n\nThose factors may allow the Fed to reinstate a balance of risks assessment in its statement, most likely a description of the risks to the US economic outlook as \"nearly balanced.\" Such phrasing is usually seen as prerequisite to policymakers even considering another rate rise. However, the US central bank has tried to move away from forward guidance as it implements rate hikes.\n\nThe Fed may also acknowledge the recent improved market indicators by dropping or softening its March warning that global economic and financial developments \"continue to pose risks.\"\n\n\"If anything, Fed officials will likely want to encourage markets to price in more tightening than is being priced in currently,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note.\n\nInvestors currently see zero chance the Fed will raise rates at this week's meeting and see a 23 per cent probability of a hike in June, according to an analysis of Fed Fund futures by the CME Group.\n\nThe Fed may be wary of making too strong a judgment on the resilience of the US economy come June until it has more data.\n\nThe global situation has already caused the Fed rate setters to dial back their estimates on the number of rate rises this year. Predictions from policymakers now show two, compared to four last December.\n\nOther major central banks are grappling with ways to deal with lackluster growth. The Fed remains concerned that with interest rates still close to zero it would have to rely on more unconventional policy tools should the economy slow.\n\nLast week the European Central Bank kept its main refinancing rate at zero and its bank overnight deposit rate in negative territory.\n\nThe Bank of Japan could cut its rates further into negative territory when it meets on Thursday.\n\nUS data in the pipeline includes the initial estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product growth on Thursday, which is expected to be weak. Economists polled by Reuters predict 0.7 per cent growth for the first quarter. The Fed will look for signs over the next few weeks that the economy is accelerating for the second quarter.\n\nAnother strong monthly jobs report in just over a week's time could assuage concerns as would evidence a recent uptick in inflation is being maintained.\n\nAs such if there isn't a balance of risks reinserted into April's statement, \"Fed officials could still use their speeches to manage market expectations higher,\" if they decide on June, said Sam Bullard, an economist at Wells Fargo.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Shares declined as much as 17 per cent Wednesday, the most since August.\n\nSales will be US$590 million to US$610 million, the company said Tuesday in a statement, missing the US$677.1 million average analyst projection. Twitter said it added 5 million monthly active users in the first quarter, for a total of 310 million. Analysts projected 308 million.\n\nChief executive officer Jack Dorsey, the co-founder who took the top job again officially in October, is trying to reshape the company's product and reputation to draw a more mainstream set of users. The company hired a chief marketing officer, as well as curators for a live news product called Moments, meant to make the network less daunting for new users. The latest strategies so far haven't revived interest from advertisers or widened the user base beyond Twitter's core constituency of journalists, celebrities and politicians.\n\n\"There's risk that Twitter is a deteriorating asset,\" Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who has a hold rating on the stock, said before the earnings report. \"I just haven't seen enough product improvements for an experience that's just materially better than people have seen in the past, or appeals more to the mainstream.\"\n\nFirst-quarter revenue grew 36 per cent to US$594.6 million, compared with $607.5 million projected by analysts. Earnings, excluding some items, were 15 cents per share, higher than the average estimate of 10 cents. The company's net loss narrowed to US$79.7 million, or 12 cents per share.\n\n\"Revenue came in at the low end of our guidance range because brand marketers did not increase spend as quickly as expected in the first quarter,\" the company said in the statement. \"We see a clear opportunity to increase our share of brand budgets over time.\" The shares dropped as much as 17 per cent to US$14.81 Wednesday in New York, the biggest intraday decline since Aug 24., and were trading at US$14.99 at 10:16 am. The stock had lost 23 per cent this year through Tuesday.\n\n\"The concern that dismal user growth would eventually affect revenue growth is starting to show up in Twitter's results,\" Jitendra Waral, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an e-mail. \"Twitter experienced lower- than-expected brand-ad spending on its network. This doesn't bode well for investor faith in Twitter's revival plans for fixing its core product.\"\n\nTwitter's\u00a0last few months have been turbulent. The company lost five of its top executives on one weekend in January, for example. Mr Dorsey also added two new members to the board, replacing two directors who are set to leave when their terms expire later this year. Meanwhile, Mr Dorsey is the boss of another public company, Square Inc, and splits his time between the two offices, a block away from each other on San Francisco's Market Street.\n\nDespite the shifts at the top of the company, Twitter has gotten clearer about explaining its purpose and its goals. Mr Dorsey in January hired Leslie Berland from American Express to be its chief marketing officer, given the task of cementing Twitter's reputation as a place for live events. The company is prioritizing live video, and working to make content deals for streaming sports, political events and entertainment.\n\nEarlier this month, Twitter agreed to pay US$10 million to the National Football League for the rights to stream 10 Thursday night games during the 2016 season, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nJust as the company is settling on \"live\" as its priority, so are its bigger competitors. Facebook Inc, which has five times the users, recently made it possible for any of them to live-stream directly on the network. Facebook also is emphasizing live news in its feed and search results. Snapchat Inc, which has more than 100 million daily active users, has become a popular place to watch \"live stories,\" which include video curated from its users.\n\nTwitter is projected to draw 2.3 per cent of the US$102.5 billion mobile Internet advertising market this year, according to eMarketer, behind Google Inc, Facebook Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The DPSS is payable May 31.\n\nGross revenue was flat at S$27.37 million, while net property income edged up 0.8 per cent to S$24.68 million. Income available for distribution rose 1.3 per cent to S$19.44 million.\n\n\"Tourist arrivals into Singapore registered encouraging growth in the first two months of the year,\" said Gerald Lee, chief executive of the Reit manager.\n\nAccording to estimates from the Singapore Tourism Board, arrivals were up 12.3 per cent year on year in January and February, bolstered by key source markets such as China and Indonesia.\n\nHe went on to say: \"While leisure traffic showed a healthy rebound, demand from the corporate segment was soft. We remain cautious given the weakness in the macro environment. We are also expecting more hotels to open this year.\"\n\nCiting a CBRE report and Far East H-Trust's research, the Reit manager noted that some 2,700 new rooms were projected to come onstream this year.\n\nFar East H-Trust comprises Far East Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (Far East H-Reit) and Far East Hospitality Business Trust. Far East H-Reit has a portfolio of 12 properties in Singapore consisting of eight hotels and four serviced residences.\n\nFor the quarter under review, average hotel occupancy rate (AOR) rose 5.7 percentage points year on year to 88 per cent, but the average daily rate fell 6.4 per cent to S$160. This resulted in a flat revenue per available room of S$141.\n\nIts serviced residences posted a 1.5 percentage point slide in AOR to 84.3 per cent while average daily rate slumped 7.1 per cent to S$223, depressing revenue per available unit by 8.7 per cent to S$188. This was due to \"weaker demand from project groups and lower corporate travel budgets\", it said.\n\nMeanwhile, revenue from the retail and office spaces was 2.1 per cent lower at S$5.8 million due to a decrease in the average occupancy, which was partially offset by a higher rental rate. Lower operating expenses helped to mitigate the shortfall in revenue.\n\n\"To stay competitive, we will continue to enhance our assets while seeking opportunities to grow the trust,\" added Mr Lee.\n\nThe trust closed trading on Wednesday at 67 Singapore cents, up one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We don't believe in going too much outside beer. That makes the likelihood of success in integration higher,\" CEO Carlos Brito told the company's annual meeting.\n\nThe comments from Brito suggested that future deals were possible but that candidates were more likely to be drawn from closer to its core business.\n\nAB InBev, which makes Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, expects to seal its US$100 billion-plus acquisition of SABMiller in the second half of the year.\n\nSpeculation about AB InBev's next move has been strengthened by a six million share option plan for some 65 senior managers, below the executive board, which would be granted if the company's revenue hit US$100 billion in 2020, 2021 or 2022.\n\nAB InBev's revenue last year was US$43.6 billion. With SABMiller, that would be a pro-forma of US$55-60 billion, including disposals, leaving a 70-80 per cent hike required in a maximum of seven years.\n\nWithout further acquisitions, this would be a giant leap, particularly with currency weakness versus the dollar making any expansion this year hard to achieve.\n\nFurthermore, with the creation of InBev in 2004 and its purchase of Anheuser-Busch in 2008, of the rest of Mexico's Modelo in 2012-2013 and SABMiller now, it has shown it tends to get the major merger bug every four years.\n\nMr Brito did talk about one clear area of growth in the coming years - low and no alcohol beers. The company has a target that these should make up 20 per cent of overall revenue by 2025. It does not say what that percentage is now.\n\nMr Brito said lower alcohol drinks were among the fastest growing parts of the market, such as in Germany and with the increasing popularity of Radler, typically a mix of beer and lemonade.\n\n\"There are a lot of consumer trends going in that direction,\" Mr Brito said. \"And the margins are very good because you don't have the excise tax because it's non-alcohol. You charge sometimes the same price as beer or higher, depending on how you position the product.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

In comparison, Halcyon Agri had negative net tangible assets of S$139 million, or negative 23.1 Singapore cents per share.\n\nIn spite of this, \"the Halcyon offer values GMG at S$0.70 per share while Halcyon is valued at S$0.75 per share\", SIAS noted.\n\nFollowing the voluntary offer Halcyon Agri will make for GMG Global, Halcyon Agri will also acquire other natural rubber assets owned by Sinochem International for S$210 million, which represents about 1.6 times their net asset value of US$93.7 million as at Dec 31.\n\nIn comparison, the implied offer of S$0.70 for GMG Global represents 0.74 times its net asset value, SIAS said.\n\n\"Does the board not think GMG is relatively under-valued in this instance?

Forecasts from suppliers such as Qualcomm Inc and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co have suggested demand is cooling, and stalled economic growth in China is paring Apple's sales in that region.\n\n\"I see nothing on the horizon from a component or a technology perspective that's going to drive these major upgrades,\" Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research LLC, said in a televised interview on Bloomberg West. \"We're going to see people hold onto these things longer, just like we saw with PCs.\"\n\nSecond-quarter sales slid 13 per cent\u00a0to US$50.6 billion from US$58 billion a year earlier, the company said Tuesday in a statement. That compared with the average analyst estimate of US$52 billion. Net income declined to US$10.5 billion, and IPhone shipments fell 16 per cent. Sales in the third quarter, which ends in June, will be US$41 billion to US$43 billion, Apple said. On average, analysts estimated revenue of US$47.4 billion,\u00a0according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe smartphone market \"is currently not growing,\" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said a conference call. \"That's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many places in the world.\" The stock dropped as much as 8.3 per cent to US$95.68 Wednesday morning and was trading at US$96.92 at 10:07 am in New York. Concerns about decelerating smartphone demand have contributed to an almost 20 per cent decline in Apple shares in the past 12 months. The\u00a0stock fell less than 1 per cent to US$104.35 at Tuesday's close in New York. That gave Apple a market capitalization of about US$579 billion - still the world's largest company by that measure.\n\nThe last time Apple's quarterly profit dropped compared with the same period a year earlier was in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, when it cited higher expenditures on developing new products. The introduction of the iTunes Store the following quarter was the starting point for surging iPod growth, which would ultimately birth the iPhone four years later.\n\nThe\u00a0Cupertino, California-based company\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0also said it will boost its share-repurchase program to US$175 billion, from the US$140 billion announced last year. Apple will increase its quarterly dividend, as it did a year ago, to 57 cents a share from 52 cents.\n\nThe second-quarter report showed that Apple is no longer able to count on China as a growth engine. Sales in that country, Taiwan and Hong Kong fell 26 per cent in the period, a major shift from just a couple of years ago, when sales in the region were more than doubling with regularity. Apple attributed the decline primarily to lower sales in Hong Kong, where the local currency peg with the US dollar made products more expensive to visitors.\n\n\"China is particularly worrisome for Apple because it has risen quite quickly to become Apple's second-most important region,\" said Brian Blau, a San Francisco-based\u00a0analyst at Gartner Inc. \"That makes us wonder what the issue is, whether it's a temporary issue or whether it's going to be something longer-term.\"\n\nIPhone sales in the recent period fell to 51.2 million from 61.2 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had predicted the company would sell 50.7 million iPhones in the quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe quarterly report is Apple's first since a high-profile legal skirmish with the US government over data privacy, encryption and law enforcement. The US dropped two separate demands that the company help it break passcodes to get data from the iPhones used by a drug dealer in New York and a shooter in a December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Apple had vehemently fought against both orders, saying that helping the government would jeopardize security for hundreds of millions of users and the cases could pose a dangerous precedent for law enforcement agencies' access to encrypted iPhone data. The Department of Justice had argued it only wanted access to specific phones in limited instances, and abandoned the two cases after finding alternate methods for unlocking the phones in question.\n\nAs iPhone sales slow, Apple investors are increasingly asking what might fuel the company's next growth spurt. A number of possibilities have surfaced: virtual reality gear, a self- driving car or a live television service, for example. Yet Apple's secretive approach to development makes it hard to predict when, in what form, or even if any of these innovations will someday surface.\n\nVirtual reality gained headlines back in January, when Cook said VR wasn't a \"niche\" and had some \"interesting applications.\" Meanwhile the potential allure of the automotive industry for Apple and other technology companies has been highlighted in recent weeks as Tesla secured more than 325,000 pre-orders for its latest electric car in a matter of days.\n\nAs growth slows, Mr Cook said Apple may look to acquisitions to speed up product development or help the company enter new product categories. Apple has made 15 acquisitions over the past 12 months, most of them small.\n\n\"We're always looking,\" Mr Cook said.\n\nAnalyst project sales will be little changed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September, and on average they predict sales growth of 4 per cent in the last three months of the year, when a new version of the full-sized iPhone is likely to be on the market.\n\nIn the meantime, the company has been adding to its product line. In March, the company rolled out the new iPhone SE, partially seen as a move to bolster sales in emerging economies such as India and China. Yet analysts cautioned that the smaller phone, starting at US$399 in the US, could risk cannibalizing sales of the more expensive flagship 6-series handsets, and may reduce the average price at which Apple sells its phones.\n\nThe lower price point of the iPhone SE is one of the main reasons for Apple's lower-than-projected third-quarter sales forecast, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview. The company has been unable to manufacture enough iPhone SEs to meet demand, he added.\n\n\"Every time we launch a new product we know there is an element of overlap,\" Mr Maestri said. \"We look at the opportunity to attract the first-time smartphone buyers.\"\n\nLast month Apple also unveiled a new, smaller iteration of the iPad Pro,\u00a0incorporating the power and some features of its larger Pro model for business users, aimed at stemming a persistent decline in sales of the tablet. IPad shipments in the recent quarter fell 19 per cent from a year earlier to 10.3 million, topping analysts' average projection of 9.4 million.\n\nTo help make up for dwindling growth in smartphones\u00a0and other devices in the shorter term, Apple has been trying to bolster its services business, which includes its iCloud storage platform, Apple Music and the App Store. Not only is the profit margin wider on these offerings, buying them usually commits customers to subscription services that generate stable recurring revenue streams over months or years. Services was a bright spot in the second quarter, with revenue jumping 20 per cent.\n\nSales of Mac computers declined 12 per cent to 4.03 million units, less than estimates of 4.6 million.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/worlds-safest-returns-signal-pessimism-em-bonds-waning", "site_title": "World's safest returns signal pessimism in EM bonds is waning", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWorld's safest returns signal pessimism in EM bonds is waning\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Apr 27, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nEmerging markets\n\nFollow\n\nLondon\n\nLOOK anywhere in the world and you will be hard-pressed to find an investment that's as profitable and safe as the dollar-denominated bonds of higher-rated companies in developing nations.\n\nTheir 5.6 per cent rally this year, while not the biggest in absolute terms, eclipses more than 130 assets from US Treasuries to gold and even bitcoin when volatility is factored in, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 19 per cent jump in Colombian stocks might sound like a better deal, but price swings in Bogota exposed investors to six times more risk. When both factors are considered, the gains in emerging-market (EM) corporate dollar bonds come out twice as good, the data show.\n\nThat marks a turnaround for the securities after last year's sell-off fuelled by concern higher US interest rates, currency swings and a slowdown in China's economy would spur corporate defaults in emerging markets. Now investors are returning, buying the bonds of borrowers such as oil-company Petroleos Mexicanos and Brazilian iron-ore exporter Vale SA in a sector that has low volatility and yields an average two percentage points more than Treasuries.\n\n\"There's too much fear earlier and the sell-off went to ridiculous levels,\" said Luc D'Hooge, who oversees US$700 million as head of emerging-market bonds at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich and bought Latin American investment-grade notes including Pemex and high-yield credit in Africa this year.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the default risk in emerging markets is not massive. The spreads we saw last year were unjustified and that's what has led to this performance,\" he said.\n\nThe travails of 2015 prompted economists from the International Monetary Fund to the Bank for International Settlements to warn investors that weakening currencies would raise the cost of repayment in emerging markets and lead to increased defaults. The threat failed to materialise this year as state support, hedging strategies and a recovery in exchange rates helped companies not only to pay off their debts, but also refinance at lower costs.\n\nThat boosted investor appetite for developing countries, helping sovereign and corporate bonds in both investment and high-yield grades to post the best four performances in a broad swathe of global assets. An analysis of 65 stock markets from Canada to New Zealand, currencies from the US dollar to Danish krone, commodities including oil and orange juice, treasuries, corporate bonds and the biggest exchange-traded funds failed to show a better score on risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe bounce-back in oil and commodity prices played a key role in the performance. Companies from these two industries dominate the sweepstakes in emerging-market bond gains. The 2042 notes of Brazil's Vale and 2022 notes of Mexico's Industrias Penoles SAB de CV have returned more than 17 per cent this year.\n\nOptimism about growth has returned, too. Signs of stability in China, an acceleration in India's economy and brighter prospects for energy-exporting countries such as Russia present a contrast to last year when the air was thick with the talk of slowdowns and recessions. The growth differential between emerging markets and developed markets is set to widen this year and the next, HSBC Holdings predicted this month.\n\nThe rally has been marked by continued pessimism among some money managers and could fizzle out with a change in any of the factors including the Federal Reserve's dovish stance, China's stimulus plans or the stability in crude prices, some analysts say. \"It's a reluctant type of rally,\" Larry Hatheway, the chief economist at GAM Holding AG in London, said. \"What certainly propels it is the absence of alternatives.\"\n\nOthers see a need for continued caution against gains overshooting fundamentals. \"We were coming off extreme pessimism last year,\" said Alberto Gallo, the head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments. \"It is too early to call it an extraordinary whole year. Investors still need to be very selective about what they buy.\"\n\nFor now, investors are seeking to escape almost US$8 trillion of global sovereign notes that offer nothing more than negative interest rates. Emerging markets help them in three ways: their bonds typically have higher rates, with those issued by investment-grade borrowers being relatively safe, and the dollar securities among them strip out the currency risk.

It would replace an earlier system of tax relief that expired at the end of 2012. Since then, companies have paid about US$2.5 billion in higher taxes on such imports, according to the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill is expected to pass the House on Wednesday under expedited debate rules. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said in an interview he hopes the Senate will advance its version soon.\n\nThe House bill is broadly backed by business. More than 200 trade groups and manufacturers including Nike Inc, Xerox Corp and Merck & Co signed an April 20 letter to lawmakers calling the proposed new tariff-petitioning process \"long overdue.\"\n\nEnactment of the plan would be \"an important victory for manufacturers of all sizes in the US,\" said Linda Dempsey, the vice president of international economic affairs at the manufacturers' group.\n\nThe vote comes amid delays in a much bigger debate over the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that is a top priority for President Barack Obama. The deal faces opposition from a number of Democrats and also would be a tough vote for Republicans from manufacturing and tobacco states who are vulnerable in this year's election. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said that while he supports free trade, he has problems with the Pacific-rim deal and doesn't want Congress to vote on whether to approve it until after the November election.\n\nThe House tariff bill, HR 4923, was approved by the Ways and Means Committee this month on a unanimous vote, with panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, calling it a win for companies and consumers.\n\nIt would allow a tariff to be reduced or suspended for up to three years as long as the lost revenue wouldn't exceed US$500,000 in a calendar year. The ITC would review businesses' requests for tariff relief and recommend a list for Congress for a vote. Lawmakers could remove some items from the list but wouldn't be allowed to add any.\n\nThe previous system, which let members of Congress submit proposals for tariff relief to the ITC, was abolished because it violated a ban on home-district \"earmarked\" favors. The last package of tariff reductions under that system was approved in 2010.\n\nThe prior system created tariff adjustments for about 80 products, including reusable shopping bags, over-the-range microwaves, camel-hair yarn and various chemicals.\n\nConservative groups that pushed for the earmark ban are backing the House bill, including the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens Against Government Waste. Two other conservative groups - Club for Growth and Heritage Action - instead want to eliminate all tariffs that generate less than US$500,000 a year in revenue for the federal government, though they aren't pressuring lawmakers to defeat the House plan.\n\nThe bill would require the ITC to create a searchable database of the petitions.

BHP Billiton has gained 30 per cent since cutting its dividend in February.\n\nThis willingness to accept lower or no dividends in favour of leaner balance sheets marks a significant shift.\n\nMoreover it would signal to European firms that efforts to spend on themselves and get in front of a pickup in growth would be rewarded while a stubborn reliance on payouts would not.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

That is uncertain. But we are confident on the direction towards a rise in prices,\" he said at the company's earnings presentation.\n\nHis comments echoed those of BP CEO Bob Dudley who said on Tuesday he expected crude prices to recover towards the end of the year. Oil hit its highest level this year on Wednesday, touching US$46.8 a barrel, after rallying in the past few months.\n\nShares in Statoil, 67 per cent owned by the Norwegian state, were up 3.7 per cent by 0829 GMT, outperforming a 1 per cent rise in the Oslo benchmark index. It was among the best-performing stocks in the Stoxx Europe 600 oil and gas index .\n\nAlthough Statoil's first-quarter underlying operating earnings plunged 70 per cent from a year ago to US$857 million due to lower oil and gas prices, they were above expectations for US$833 million in a Reuters poll of analysts.\n\nIts core Norwegian business recorded a higher-than-expected profit in the first quarter, while its international unit posted a smaller loss than analysts had predicted, due to Statoil's cost-cutting scheme.\n\n\"We think the key takeaway of Statoil's results is success from their upstream cost reduction programmes which are driving better bottom-line results,\" brokerage firm Bernstein said in a note to clients. Bernstein has an Outperform rating on the stock. \"Both Upstream Norway and Upstream International did better than we estimated due to lower costs. Statoil is therefore following the trend of the European majors group ie opex reduction momentum, higher production, continued capex downside, and ultimately falling oil price break-evens.\"\n\nStatoil said it increased its underlying production by 2 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, after adjusting for divestments.\n\nThe Norwegian company has less exposure to refining than some oil majors, so has not benefited as much from rising refining margins as the oil price tumbled.\n\nIt said it would propose a first-quarter dividend of 22.01 US cents in line with its own guidance to keep the dividend at this level for the first three quarters.\n\nLike French peer Total, Statoil has proposed that shareholders could choose shares over cash as a dividend payment, a so-called scrip dividend. Total also maintained its dividend on Wednesday as it posted forecast-beating net profits.\n\nStatoil also kept its capital spending target of US$13 billion and a total exploration activity level of US$2 billion this year. However, analysts from Pareto, Carnegie and Exane BNP Paribas said they expect capex to be lower than US$13 billion this year.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

By 2020, the OECD says gross domestic product would be more than 3 per cent smaller than with continued EU membership, which it calculates is equivalent to a cost of 2,200 pounds (US$3,200) per household. By 2030, GDP would be 5 per cent lower, equivalent to 3,200 pounds.\n\n\"Brexit would harm the economy to a considerable extent,\" the organization said. It would be \"akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained.\"\n\nThe OECD report joins a chorus of warnings about the impact Brexit would have on both domestic and European growth. The Bank of Englandcalled it the biggest risk to domestic financial stability, with policy makers saying the June 23 referendum is already weighing on growth. The International Monetary Fund said this month that it was concerned about the \"severe\" damage a vote to leave could inflict, while the World Bank has cautioned that the global economy won't cope well with the increased uncertainty surrounding the decision.\n\nVote Leave campaign spokesman Robert Oxley rejected the OECD's \"doom-laden predictions,\" accusing it of being consistently wrong on the EU. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage described the institution on BBC radio of being \"stuffed with people who failed in politics.\" The report comes amid signs the British economy is already losing momentum. It expanded 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, matching the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2012, data showed.\n\n\"It's good news that Britain continues to grow, but there are warnings today that the threat of leaving the EU is weighing on our economy,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who is campaigning to remain in the 28-nation bloc, said in a statement. \"Investments and building are being delayed, and another group of international experts, the OECD, confirms British families would be worse off if we leave the EU.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Iron ore imports by the world's biggest buyer may drop 5 per cent to 900 million tons, it said.\n\nThe outlook for a recovery in China's market has fueled a speculative surge in prices of steel, iron ore and coking coal.

Some retailers and suppliers in Asia aren't so sure.\n\nIn a Reuters survey of 10 retailers in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, seven - including four Apple Stores - reported solid early demand, but three third-party retailers said sales were weak. Two suppliers of components for Apple phones, including the new iPhone SE, said they were seeing lower orders.\n\n\"I've been dealing with iPhones for five to six years now. This current quarter for Apple feels weak,\" said an executive at a Taiwan-based company whose components are used in iPhones including the SE model, which markets for US$399. \"Our current shipment situation for Apple is not like the last two years. There are more iPhone models, but the total volume of iPhones is falling.\" Such a mixed outlook from Greater China, its most important market after the United States and generator of a quarter of the company's revenue, could be a major cause of concern for Apple.\n\nThe company's revenue from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 26 per cent in the March quarter, making it the weakest region in the world.\n\nApple did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters survey.\n\n\"iPhone is still popular but sales have dropped because... there's no new model and the SE is similar to 5C. So it doesn't sell well,\" said Zhu You Peng, a salesman at Apple product reseller Xiongyu in Shenzhen. The 5C was Apple's last attempt to produce a cheaper phone, back in 2013.\n\nMr Zhu said it sold around 300 iPhones per month last year but the number has dropped to around 100-200 this year.\n\nThat view contrasts with upbeat comments about the phone from Apple's Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri on Tuesday.\n\n\"The situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,\" he told Reuters, referring to the iPhone SE. \"The demand has been very, very strong.\"\n\nThe iPhone SEs are sold out in Apple's own stores in mainland China and customers have to wait about three weeks to get the product delivered by Apple, according to Apple's websites. The size of the original supplies to the stores is unclear.\n\nApple, whose shares dropped about 8 per cent after it reported the disappointing first-quarter results on Tuesday, is under pressure to show that the decline in iPhone sales represents just a hiccup, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.\n\nIt isn't the only challenge facing the US technology giant. Its mobile entertainment services were blocked online in China earlier this month just at a time when it wants to grow services business as potential source of revenue against tapering iPhone sales. The New York Times reported that a state regulator had demanded Apple halt the services.\n\nThe new phone was seen as an important offsetting influence in subsequent periods until Apple launches its iPhone 7 - widely expected around September. The lower price point was part of a strategy to compete against Asian rivals in emerging markets such as China.\n\nAt the iPhone SE product launch in March, Apple vice president of iPhone product marketing Greg Joswiak singled out China as a target market, saying four-inch displays like that on the iPhone SE were still popular with first-time smartphone buyers. Apple's mainstream iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens.\n\nAnother supplier said iPhone orders will be lower in the second quarter and second half of this year. It also provides a component for the SE model. \"Our customer is aiming for a higher target, but we are more conservative on that,\" the person said, referring to Apple.\n\nThat adds to concern that Apple may further lose momentum in China, where slowing economic growth may prompt more consumers to snap up cheaper phones. \"Local brands are taking up more sales, especially among low income people who earn less than 3,000 yuan (S$623.50) a month. Oppo, Vivo phones that cost around 1,000-2,000 yuan sells the best among them,\" said Mr Zhu at Xiongyu.\n\nAided by strong market share gain in China, Chinese smartphone vendors shipped more smartphones globally than Apple and Samsung Electronics Co combined had supplied for the first time in the first quarter, according to research firm TrendForce.\n\nUnderscoring the surging growth for Chinese vendors, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, third-largest after Samsung and Apple, reported earlier this month a 62 per cent growth in global smartphone shipments in the first quarter.\n\n\"Consumers who want to show they are rich enough, they will buy an iPhone... those who want to use something different, they will choose Samsung,\" Joonsuh Kim, chief design officer of Huawei's consumer business group, told Reuters, referring to consumers in China.\n\n\"But these days consumers are not that old fashioned. They are getting much smarter, and this is why we have much chance,\"said the former Samsung mobile design director.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

It is then expected to edge up marginally to 4 per cent in 2017.\n\nGrowth in Singapore has been driven by three clusters: modern services, trade-related industries, and the domestic cluster. Over the last few years, the modern services cluster - led by a surge in gains in the financial sector - has expanded strongly.\n\nGrowth from activities concentrated at home, such as construction and healthcare, has risen steadily, buoyed by public projects.\n\nPerformance in trade-related industries has, however, deteriorated, amid persistent weakness in the external environment.\n\nBut in early 2016, the impact of weaker external demand broadened, reflected by a step-down in exports across most regional economies. The finance industry pulled back, as offshore lending such as trade finance eased. Corporate demand for business services, such as consultancy, weakened. Meanwhile, the domestic retail segment has been hit by weakening consumer confidence.\n\nIn the first quarter, the trade-related sector posted a surprising upturn, though this was due to \"idiosyncratic factors\". The pharmaceuticals segment, which is typically volatile, saw a large surge in output from three months ago.\n\nThe Singapore economy grew by 1.8 per cent year on year in the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, unchanged from the previous quarter, flash estimates this month showed. While this beat market forecasts, growth was flat on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, a contrast to the 6.2 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter.\n\n\"Growth in capital formation in the G-3 is likely to be lower than last year, which could weigh on Singapore's trade-related industries given their exposure to the global investment cycle,\" said MAS.\n\nSingapore's electronics and precision engineering industries are the most vulnerable to a pullback in foreign investment, it noted.\n\n\"The sluggish investment climate stems in part from the global manufacturing malaise that has persisted in the post-GFC era,\" said MAS. In China, fixed asset investment has recently been on a secular downtrend.\n\nGrowth in Asia excluding Japan will be hampered by the sharp run-up in debt in the post-GFC period, with China seeing the most pronounced lift in leverage, MAS said. One market view is that China should be able to grow its way out of the debt burden.\n\nOver time, the rebalancing of the Chinese economy towards consumption should support demand for imported services, MAS said.\n\nIt noted that the quarterly SME business survey, conducted by the Singapore Business Federation and DP Information Group, showed that business sentiment was at its lowest level since 2010. \"Given the more downbeat external outlook, corporate margins could come under further strain in the near term.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nLabour pains flagged in central bank's macroeconomic review\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Meanwhile, the government's policy of gradually raising the point at which people start paying income tax meant that the share of the adult population paying it fell to 56.2 per cent from 65.7 per cent.\n\nThe shift is partly the result of long-term trends. In 1978-79, the richest 1 per cent paid 11 per cent of total income-tax receipts. Since then, growing inequality has meant that the larger tax burden on the richest reflects their rising incomes.\n\n\"One implication of an income-tax base that increasingly relies on a smaller group of taxpayers is that the growth of receipts may be more unpredictable and risky,\" the IFS said.\n\n\"As the system becomes more reliant on a smaller subset of individuals, tax revenues become more sensitive to the composition of income growth, making revenues more uncertain.\"\n\nIt's not just the very highest earners who have been affected. Over the same period, the number of people paying tax at the higher 40 per cent rate and above rose to 5 million from 3.9 million.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Spire runs a fleet of \"nanosatellites\" that can detect and track ships as they pass through Indonesian waters.\n\nShips on the high seas are required by international law to carry a transponder that \"pings\" information via radio frequency about their identity and location to other vessels in order to avoid collisions.\n\nSpire's miniature satellites - each no bigger than a wine bottle - collect this publicly available information to quickly and accurately construct a global map of shipping movements, and transmit this data to authorities on the ground.\n\nIndonesia can then respond to any \"red flags\" - like a vessel switching off its transponder - that might suggest a suspicious ship is passing through their territory, Spire's business development executive Mark Dembitz told AFP.\n\n\"This provides them an additional arrow in the quiver to fight the good fight,\" said Mr Dembitz.\n\n\"They are looking to use as much technology as they possibly can to solve their illegal fishing problem.\" It will also give Indonesia a technological edge to closely monitor its vast exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the remote Natuna Islands in the South China Sea, the scene of a tense standoff between Jakarta and Beijing last month.\n\nIndonesia was towing a Chinese vessel it claimed was trawling without a permit near the fish-rich Natunas when Chinese coastguards appeared and rammed the captured boat.\n\nIndonesia does not have overlapping territorial claims with Beijing in the hotly disputed waters, but it does object to a segmented line China uses to define its claims since this overlaps Indonesia's EEZ north of the Natunas.\n\nIndonesia, a vast archipelago of 17,000 islands, has taken a tough stance on illegal fishing, impounding around 200 foreign vessels caught trawling without permits.\n\nMany of those vessels have later been blown up in spectacular public displays that have stoked tensions with Indonesia's neighbours and trading partners.\n\nJakarta remains unapologetic and has vowed to defend its maritime borders from the illicit trade it claims costs billions every year in lost revenue.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Treasuries to gold and even bitcoin when volatility is factored in, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 19 percent jump in Colombian stocks might sound like a better deal, but price swings in Bogota exposed investors to six times more risk. When both factors are considered, the gains in emerging-market corporate dollar bonds come out twice as good, the data show.\n\nThat marks a turnaround for the securities after last year's selloff fuelled by concern higher US interest rates, currency swings and a slowdown in China's economy would spur corporate defaults in emerging markets. Now investors are returning, buying the bonds of borrowers such as oil-company Petroleos Mexicanos and Brazilian iron-ore exporter Vale SA in a low-volatility sector yielding an average 2 percentage points more than Treasuries.\n\n\"There was too much fear earlier and the selloff went to ridiculous levels,\" said Luc D'Hooge, who oversees US$700 million as head of emerging-market bonds at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich and bought Latin American investment-grade notes including Pemex and high-yield credit in Africa this year.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the default risk in emerging markets is not massive. The spreads we saw last year were unjustified and that's what has led to this performance.\" The travails of 2015 prompted economists from the International Monetary Fund to the Bank for International Settlements to warn investors that weakening currencies would raise the cost of repayment in emerging markets and lead to increased defaults. The threat failed to materialize this year as state support, hedging strategies and a recovery in exchange rates helped companies not only to pay off their debts, but also refinance at lower costs.\n\nThat boosted investor appetite for developing countries, helping sovereign and corporate bonds in both investment and high-yield grades to post the best four performances in a broad swathe of global assets. An analysis of 65 stock markets from Canada to New Zealand, currencies from the US dollar to Danish krone, commodities including oil and orange juice, treasuries, corporate bonds and the biggest exchange-traded funds failed to show a better score on risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe bounce-back in oil and commodity prices played a key role in the performance. Companies from these two industries dominate the sweepstakes in emerging-market bond gains. The 2042 notes of Brazil's Vale and\u00a02022 notes of Mexico's Industrias Penoles SAB de CV have returned more than 17 percent this year.\n\nOptimism about growth has returned, too. Signs of stability in China, an acceleration in India's economy and brighter prospects for energy-exporting countries such as Russia present a contrast to last year when the air was thick with the talk of slowdowns and recessions. The growth differential between emerging markets and developed markets is set to widen this year and the next, HSBC Holdings Plc predicted this month.\n\nThe rally has been marked by continued pessimism among some money managers and could fizzle out with a change in any of the factors including the Federal Reserve's dovish stance, China's stimulus plans or the stability in crude prices, some analysts say.\n\n\"It's a reluctant type of rally,\" said Larry Hatheway, the chief economist at GAM Holding AG in London. \"What certainly propels it is the absence of alternatives.\"\n\nMr Hatheway, who still sees value in the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent the South African rand, said it's \"tough\" to find many favourites after gains in the past two months.\n\nOthers see a need for continued caution against gains overshooting fundamentals.\n\n\"We were coming off extreme pessimism last year,\" said Alberto Gallo, the head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments Ltd in London, who sees value in European financial debt and US high-yield corporate bonds. \"It is too early to call it an extraordinary whole year. Investors still need to be very selective about what they buy.\"\n\nIn the developing world, Mr Gallo sees promise in Argentina, as well as countries with less exposure to commodities like India and Mexico.\n\nFor now, investors are seeking to escape almost US$8 trillion of global sovereign notes that offer nothing more than negative interest rates. Emerging markets help them in three ways: their bonds typically have higher rates, with those issued by investment-grade borrowers being relatively safe, and the dollar securities among them strip out the currency risk.\n\n\"Now people are asking why invest in bonds with negative yields because you're sure to lose money,\" Vontobel's Mr D'Hooge said. \"If you are ready to accept a little bit of risk and volatility, you can make much more returns.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Unable to stop the sinking, Jakarta has focused its attention on bolstering its defences with a 15-mile seawall and refurbishing the crumbling flood canal system.\n\nThe plan is known as the \"Giant Sea Wall\" or \"Great Garuda\", for its resemblance from the air to the bird-god of Hindu mythology that is Indonesia's national symbol.\n\n\"The point the president wants to make is the project is needed to save Jakarta,\" said city Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. \"But the national interest shouldn't be entangled in the legal cases.\"\n\nIncluded in the master plan is the building of 17 artificial islands off Jakarta's northern coast, where property developers plan to build shopping malls and attractions similar to Singapore's Sentosa Island.\n\nBut work on these islands will be suspended for six months, said cabinet secretary Pramono Anung, after officials named the president director of property developer PT Agung Podomoro Tbk a suspect in allegedly bribing a city council member to influence the regulation for a land reclamation.\n\nAuthorities have also imposed a travel ban on the head of another property company, Agung Sedayu Group, and could soon name more suspects.\n\n\"We see this as a big case because it involves a Jakarta programme that is quite huge and that has become the object of the world's attention,\" Saut Situmorang, one of the key anti-graft investigators, told Reuters.\n\nMr Joko has backed the investigation and ordered his ministers to oversee every facet of the project.\n\n\"The president stressed that this project should not be driven by the private sector, but it should be completely within the control of the central and regional governments,\" Mr Anung said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Now for GAC Motor's development in the US we also hope for Chrysler's support and help,\" said GAC Motor General Manager Wu Song on the sidelines of the Beijing auto show, which ends on May 4.\n\nMr Wu and representatives of GAC Motor did not elaborate on what type of support Fiat Chrysler might offer. A Fiat Chrysler spokesman declined to comment.\n\nForeign car makers in China are required to form joint ventures with local firms if they want to manufacture domestically and thereby avoid hefty import taxes.\n\nGuangzhou Auto was the sixth-largest automaker in China by sales volume last year, including vehicles produced through joint ventures with Fiat Chrysler, Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\n\nExtending cooperation beyond China is uncharted territory, though General Motors Co and China's largest automaker, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, plan to begin joint production in Indonesia next year.\n\nGAC Motor is in discussions with potential dealership partners in the United States and has yet to begin road tests there - the two biggest steps it must take to start sales. Mr Wu said the automaker is already doing tests in China on two of its car models against American standards.\n\nChina's auto market is slowing down and price competition is rising, but Wu said GAC Motor will keep its primary focus on the mainland rather than overseas expansion.\n\n\"Sudden price cuts have messed up the whole (Chinese) market, so at this time we have to invest a lot of energy determining the brand's next strategic steps to protect our position,\" he said. \"We must not be distracted.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

We'll have to see in a few months or so, but I'm not sure that it's getting better now,\" said Franck Puget, a 45-year-old worker in the insurance industry, stopped in a central Paris street by Reuters TV.\n\nMr Hollande can take some relief in monthly jobless figures published on Wednesday which showed that the number of people out of work fell in March by the most in over 15 years. The figures nevertheless raise some questions.\n\nMuch of the decline was due to people dropping out of the tally because they had not updated their job-seeker status.\n\nThat could be a sign they found work. However, with the average time people stay unemployed at a record 580 days, it could also be down to people giving up hope of finding a job and so not bothering to update their status.\n\nGoing by INSEE's survey, households are not yet buying into the idea that a sustained recovery in the labour market is taking hold. Unemployment fears rose in April to the highest level since October.\n\n\"There are not a lot of people that believe (in a recovery)\", said Francoise Escoffier, a lawyer, told Reuters TV ahead of the data. \"There's no reason to expect a decrease in unemployment and a stronger economy.\"\n\nThe government expects the economy to grow 1.5 per cent this year, but a Reuters poll this month of private economists showed that on average they expect 1.2 per cent - the same as last year.\n\nEconomists estimate anything less than 1.5 per cent growth would not be enough to get unemployment falling sustainably, which would be bad news for Mr Hollande since he has said he will not run for re-election unless joblessness comes down.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

No diapers or car parts or aspirin - it's all been well documented. But now the country is at risk of running out of money itself.\n\nIn a tale that highlights the chaos of unbridled inflation, Venezuela is scrambling to print new bills fast enough to keep up with the torrid pace of price increases. Most of the cash, like nearly everything else in the oil-exporting country, is imported. And with hard currency reserves sinking to critically low levels, the central bank is doling out payments so slowly to foreign providers that they are foregoing further business.\n\nVenezuela, in other words, is now so broke that it may not have enough money to pay for its money.\n\nThis article is based on interviews with a dozen industry executives, diplomats and former officials as well as internal company and central bank documents.\n\nAll of the companies declined official comment; the central bank did not respond to numerous requests for interviews and comment.\n\nThe story began last year when the government of President Nicolas Maduro tried to tamp down a growing currency shortfall. Multi-million-dollar orders were placed with a slew of currency makers ahead of December elections and holidays, when Venezuelans throng banks to cash their bonuses.\n\nAt one point, instead of a public bidding process, the central bank called an emergency meeting and asked companies to produce as many bills as possible. The companies complied, only to find payments not fully forthcoming.\n\nLast month, De La Rue, the world's largest currency maker, sent a letter to the central bank complaining that it was owed US$71 million and would inform its shareholders if the money were not forthcoming. The letter was leaked to a Venezuelan news website and confirmed by Bloomberg News.\n\n\"It's an unprecedented case in history that a country with such high inflation cannot get new bills,\" said Jose Guerra, an opposition law maker and former director of economic research at the central bank.\n\nLate last year, the central bank ordered more than 10 billion bank notes, surpassing the 7.6 billion the US Federal Reserve requested this year for an economy many times the size of Venezuela's.\n\nThe currency crisis sheds light on the magnitude of the country's financial woes and its limited ability to remedy them as oil - the mainstay of its economy - continues to flatline. Venezuela's inflation, the world's highest, is expected to rise this year to close to 500 per cent, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe first signs of the currency shortage date back to 2014 when the government began increasing shipments of bank notes as wallet-busting wads of cash were already needed for simple transactions. Venezuelans spend hours waiting in line for consumer staples, lining up first at banks and cash machines, often carrying the loot in backpacks and gym bags to pay for dinner out.\n\nAhead of the 2015 congressional elections, the central bank tapped the UK's De La Rue, France's Oberthur Fiduciaire and Germany's Giesecke & Devrient to bring in some 2.6 billion notes, according to bank documents and people familiar with the deals. Before the delivery was completed, the bank approached the companies directly for more.\n\nDe La Rue took the lion's share of the 3-billion-note order and enlisted the Ottawa-based Canadian Bank Note Company to ensure it could meet a tight end-of-year deadline.\n\nThe cash arrived in dozens of 747 jets and chartered planes. Under cover of security forces and snipers, it was transferred to armored caravans where it was spirited to the central bank in dead of night.\n\nWhile the cash was still arriving - at times, multiple planeloads a day - authorities set their sights on the year ahead. In late 2015, the central bank more than tripled its original order, offering tenders for some 10.2 billion bank notes, according to industry sources. But currency companies were worried. According to company documents, De La Rue began experiencing delays in payment as early as June.\n\nSimilarly, the bank was slow to pay Giesecke & Devrient and Oberthur Fiduciaire. So when the tender was offered, the government only received about 3.3 billion in bids, bank documents show.\n\n\"Initially, your eyes grow as big as dish plates,\" said one person familiar with matter. \"An order big enough to fill your factory for a year, but do you want to completely expose yourself to a country as risky as Venezuela?\" Further complicating matters is the sheer amount of bills needed for basic transactions. Venezuela's largest bill, the 100-bolivar note, today barely pays for a loose cigarette at a street kiosk.\n\nAs early as 2013, the central bank commissioned studies for 200 and 500 bolivar notes, former monetary officials say. Despite repeated assurances, no new denominations have been ordered, pushing Venezuela into uncharted territory by its refusal to produce larger bills while not fully paying providers.\n\nCompanies are backing away. With its traditional partners now unenthusiastic about taking on new business, the central bank is in negotiations with others, including Russia's Goznack, and has a contract with Boston-based Crane Currency, according to documents and industry sources.\n\nSteve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, who has studied hyperinflation for decades, says that to maintain faith in the currency when prices spiral, governments often add zeros to bank notes rather than flood the market.\n\n\"It's a very bad sign to see people running around with wheelbarrows full of money to buy a hot dog,\" he said. \"Even the cash economy starts breaking down.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/b3a8b776a289f11083f0669b9de7b416ef8569947edf43ff31407b6b92002827?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Venezuela's epic shortages are nothing new at this point.

It points to a more creative and less rigid marketing strategy,\"said Virendra Chauhan, analyst at Energy Aspects in Singapore.\n\nAramco sold Shandong Chambroad a cargo, including Arab Heavy crude, at a differential to the Oman/Dubai benchmark price, said an industry source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Arab Heavy May OSP was set at a US$3.65 per barrel discount to Oman/Dubai.\n\nThe shipment moved out of Aramco's storage site on the Japanese island of Okinawa that it operates as protection against supply disruptions and to react quickly to short-term demand.\n\nRussia has filled most of the surging demand from China's teapots, most of which were only allowed last year to import crude, pushing it to China's biggest oil supplier in March and in four separate months in 2015, nudging aside the Saudis.\n\n\"For the Saudis, offering a spot cargo to a teapot signals they want to bite back at the Russians, who have supplied most of the demand by the rising teapots,\" said a senior trader who has done deals with Saudis and Chinese importers.\n\n\"And it tells other producers, Iran in particular, that the Saudis are willing to play hard ball in the rush for Asia's market share.\"\n\nIran, freed from crippling sanctions in January, boosted exports in February to Asia's four biggest oil buyers by 24.6 per cent from a year ago to 1.28 million barrels per day (bpd), government and tanker-tracking data showed.\n\nIran has increased its production to 1.9 million bpd, up from just over 1 million bpd in January, and plans to reach the pre-sanction level of 4 million bpd as soon as possible.\n\nOther sources said Aramco's move was a test to explore whether it could start a long-term relationship with China's teapots.\n\n\"This for now is a one-off test of the teapot's interest and its technical ability to process Saudi oil,\" said a Beijing-based trading official with knowledge of Aramco's marketing.\n\nNeither Saudi Aramco nor Shandong Chambroad Petrochemicals were available for comment.\n\nChambroad's deal with Aramco is a major win for a teapot, which usually lack the credit ratings needed to sign long-term international contracts.\n\nMajor oil producers have shunned teapots after several deals fell through within months of them entering the market. \"The deal gives them access to Aramco supplies,\" said a person familiar with the deal.\n\n\"That's like a knighthood for the teapot.\"\n\nOil producers are scrambling to find buyers as supplies still outstrip demand, causing prices to drop 70 per cent between mid-2014 and early 2016.\n\n\"It is obvious that there is a major turf war going on in the crude market,\" said an oil tanker broker.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

By contrast, industrial and construction output declined 0.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.\n\nManufacturing and construction output suffered the steepest drops in annual terms since early 2013.\n\nThe soft outlook for the world economy, combined with a slowdown in British wage growth, has prompted economists to push back their bets on when the Bank of England will raise rates into next year.\n\nOfficial data earlier this month showed industrial output shrank at the fastest rate in more than three years in the three months to February and the trade deficit ballooned to its widest in eight years.\n\nWhile consumer demand has remained broadly solid, retail sales dropped at the joint-fastest rate in March since January 2014, adding to signs of a slowdown.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

While that's more than double the previous period, the forecast is below analysts' projection for 44.1 billion yen, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares of Nintendo fell 6.1 per cent in German trading following the announcement.\n\nNintendo predicted that Wii U sales will fall to 800,000 units from 3.26 million, while those of 3DS will decline to 5 million from 6.79 million. Tatsumi Kimishima, Nintendo's chief executive officer, said two new smartphone games - Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing - will help bolster profit this year. Nintendo said Wednesday that the NX, the company's next gaming platform, will debut in March of next year.\n\nRevenue fell 8 per cent to 504.5 billion yen for the year that ended in March. Net income for the latest fiscal year was 16.5 billion yen, compared with 41.8 billion yen a year earlier.\n\nNintendo shares jumped 33 per cent in 2015 after the company said it planned to develop titles for iPhones and other mobile devices. Miitomo lets users automatically generate a cartoon- like avatar using a photo taken on the smartphone, and tweak minute facial features, set personality parameters and choose the character's voice.\n\nStill, Nintendo was criticized last year when it said the app would be free-to-play, and didn't include characters from its popular Mario and Zelda gaming franchises.\n\nMore than 10 million Miitomo users have registered since the app's March release, the company said on Wednesday. It also topped US and Japan rankings for free-to-play iOS apps, according to market researcher App Annie. SurveyMonkey Intelligence estimated the messaging-based app is making US$280,000 a week.\n\nNintendo teamed with DeNA Co, operator of the Mobage network, to create mobile games and operate new membership services that will eventually - though not immediately - include applications based on Nintendo's character lineup of plumbers, gorillas and princesses.

Russia supplies a third of EU natural gas supplies.\n\nOther consignments are due to follow following US accords with EDF and Engie of France and British Gas.\n\nFrance's Engie has a deal with Cheniere to buy up to 12 cargoes of LNG a year between 2018 and 2023.\n\nIn 2008 Cheniere was still banking on the opposite strategy of gas imports. But the gush of gas from shale fields, enabled by developments in hydraulic fracturing or fracking technology, turned the tables.\n\nUS natural gas production shot up nearly 43 per cent between 2010 and 2014 on the surge in shale output.\n\nNatural gas produced in Europe costs about US$4.18 per million BTUs (British thermal unit), compared with roughly US$2 in the United States. With a transportation cost estimated at 50 US cents per million BTUs, the US price remains attractive.\n\nSwiss group Ineos took March delivery of a US consignment of liquified ethane for use in the petrochemicals industry at Rafnes in Norway, which is outside the EU.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

President Tetsuro Aikawa said a day earlier that the company had been improperly measuring the mileage of models since 1991, adding 11 years to the period of misconduct that executives initially disclosed last week.\n\nThe automaker is carefully assessing the future impact from the testing irregularities, according to the company statement. Mitsubishi Motors said it had cash and equivalents of 462.4 billion yen (S$5.62 billion) as of end of March.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board also announced an investigation of whether models sold in the US meet fuel economy regulations.\n\nThe EPA has instructed Mitsubishi to provide additional information on vehicles sold in the US and will direct the company to conduct additional testing, EPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday in Washington.\n\nMitsubishi Motors has yet to specify how many models the company certified without complying with Japanese law. The fraud already reported has also prompted a probe by US regulators. The company's board this week formed a panel of three ex-prosecutors to investigate for about three months.\n\nMitsubishi Motors shares fell Wednesday for a sixth day, slashing the company's market value by 51 per cent during that span to about 415 billion yen. The deepening crisis is the worst for the automaker since it admitted more than a decade ago that it covered up defects in its trucks.\n\nThe flaws including faulty axles that led wheels to detach in fatal accidents. That scandal prompted multiple bailouts from Mitsubishi group companies.\n\nThe company said Tuesday it hasn't decided how it will compensate customers. It's in reimbursement talks with Nissan Motor Co, which buys minicars from the company to sell under its own brand. Nissan was supplied about three-quarters of the 625,000 minicars already identified as having been improperly tested and relying on manipulated data.\n\nNissan has voluntarily stopped sales of the Japan-only models, called Dayz and Dayz Roox. The models are sold under the Mitsubishi brand as eK Wagon and eK Space.\n\nWrongdoing by the Japanese automaker and Volkswagen AG has prompted a reckoning of the ways carmakers test for and label the fuel economy and exhaust emissions of their vehicles. While Volkswagen has set aside 16.2 billion euros (S$24.76 billion) to cover the costs of its emissions-cheating scandal, Mitsubishi Motors has less money to work with. The company had 484.7 billion yen in cash and equivalents as of Dec 31, the lowest among Japan's major automakers at the end of December.\n\nJapan's transport ministry on Tuesday asked Mitsubishi Motors to re-submit findings from its investigation of improper testing methods by May 11. An initial report that the company provided the regulator was insufficient, Takao Onoda, a ministry official, said Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to potential payouts to customers and Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors may have to pay back government tax rebates that its minicars shouldn't have been eligible for, Ryugo Nakao, an executive vice president, said last week.\n\nNissan first uncovered fuel economy discrepancies when working on development for the next generation of the minicars. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said Monday that Nissan will decide on the future of the partnership after further verification.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a461a471f65f17df7ceccfd2909ed23b746b5a9e7736814af9575451a60487c0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Mitsubishi Motors Corp abstained from forecasting its results for this fiscal year as revelations that it committed fuel-economy testing fraud for more than a quarter century clouds the company's outlook."}]}

Lower household income and higher costs for credit will weigh on demand for houses at least through mid-2017, the report said.\n\n\"The severity of the ongoing recession will lead to increased payment delays and defaults over the next two years,\" Moody's analysts including Ceres Lisboa and Cristiane Spercel wrote.\n\nBrazil is suffering from a shrinking economy, rising unemployment and inflation that has exceeded the central bank's target for years, damping demand for new houses and making it more difficult for workers to borrow. While the government has used state-owned lenders to bolster credit in an effort to fuel growth, increased concern about the country's fiscal accounts is making that strategy increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nCaixa has tapped into the national worker's social security fund, and sought other, more expensive sources of financing to support mortgage issuance after exhausting the amount it could loan based on the deposits it holds, according to Moody's.

It wasn't immediately clear how such a transaction would affect DreamWorks Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nBuying the maker of the \"\n\nShrek\n\n\" and \"\n\nKung Fu Panda\n\n\" movies would bolster Comcast's collection of animated films as the largest US cable provider searches for ways to grow amid a trend of cord-cutters dropping traditional TV for online video services like Netflix. Such a move may also illustrate how Hollywood is heating up in terms of deal activity, with Viacom Inc saying it's looking to sell part of Paramount Pictures.\n\n\"Content owners have become increasingly valuable as of late and we could argue Comcast sees potential value in the library of franchises, characters that could be integrated,\" said Eric Wold, a B Riley & Co analyst covering the entertainment industry.\n\nDreamWorks Animation spokesman Dan Berger declined to comment. Comcast representatives weren't immediately available for comment.\n\nThe report revives merger speculation surrounding DreamWorks Animation since 2014, which included approaches from Hasbro Inc and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.\n\nAfter a series of film write-offs, Mr Katzenberg in early 2015 implemented a wide ranging restructuring that involved cutting 18 per cent of its workforce and selling its Glendale, California-based campus after costs swelled.\n\nThe studio also committed to reducing its film costs and the number of films it made a year to two. Mr Katzenberg himself said he would refocus on making his features profitable. There have been some bright spots, with the studio seeing some success with \"\n\nHome\n\n\", its only feature last year, and its growing TV business.\n\nComcast's Universal Pictures comes off its best year ever in movies but will faces the challenge of keeping up with Walt Disney Co - owner of LucasFilm, Marvel and Pixar - which will produce an estimated record number of billion-dollar movies in 2016. Comcast's NBCUniversal business - which includes TV, films and theme parks - generated about 38 per cent of total revenue and 30.5 per cent of operating income last year.\n\nDreamWorks shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at US$27.12 in New York on Tuesday.

You cannot be complacent,\" said Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault-Nissan.\n\nBMW has enabled some vehicles to use several popular Chinese apps, including microblogging platform Weibo.\n\nAnd all vehicles sold by French automobile maker PSA Peugeot-Citroen in China will be connected via 4G SIM card by 2020 - compared to 20 per cent of its current upmarket DS range.\n\nPSA will also equip some cars with a wi-fi hotspot in collaboration with Alibaba, and offer an app to remotely check the vehicle's location and petrol levels.\n\nChinese buyers have lower privacy concerns than elsewhere, and are the most willing in the world to share their data, McKinsey found in a 2015 study.\n\n\"The Chinese want up-to-date interactive maps showing places of interest like restaurants and shops,\" said Celine Le Cotonnec, PSA's China head of connected services, digital marketing and mobility.\n\n\"They are also really into social messaging and games,\" which offer relief from the tedium of traffic jams, she added.\n\nBut while the large tech companies are working with carmakers for now, some may soon become auto competitors themselves as the lines between the two industries begin to blur.\n\nAt the Beijing auto show, Alibaba and Baidu displayed their own self-driving cars, while online video giant LeECO unveiled an electric car.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

It's a defeat for Exxon, which sought to retain the rating after S&P placed it on notice in February.\n\nBefore the downgrade, Exxon shared the distinction with just two other companies: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\"Nothing has changed in terms of the company's financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet,\" Scott Silvestri, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.\n\n\"Exxon Mobil places a high value on its strong credit position and continues to be focused on creating long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility.\" The downgrade is another blow to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson's legacy as he approaches the company's mandatory retirement age next year. In the decade he's led the world's most valuable publicly traded oil explorer, he spearheaded a US$35 billion bet on natural gas right before the market collapsed.\n\nThat was followed by a stillborn partnership with Russia's state-controlled crude driller that stranded US$1 billion behind a wall of international sanctions.\n\nS&P questioned Exxon's decision to spend US$54 billion on stock buybacks since 2012 even as its debt load swelled. Exxon's preference for returning cash to shareholders may be hurting its ability to stockpile cash and pay down debt, the credit rating company said. Exxon is scheduled to release first-quarter earnings on Friday before the start of trading.\n\n\"The company's debt level has more than doubled in recent years, reflecting high capital spending on major projects in a high commodity price environment and dividends and share repurchases that substantially exceeded internally generated cash flow,\" S&P wrote in the note.\n\nExxon also is facing challenges in finding enough new discoveries to replace the crude it's pumping from the ground, S&P said on Tuesday. The company only found enough new oil last year to replace 67 per cent of its production.\n\n\"In our view, the company's greatest business challenge is replacing its ongoing production,\" S&P said.\n\nOil prices have tumbled almost 60 per cent since June 2014 and are trading at about US$44 a barrel. The crash has choked crude-producing nations like Nigeria and Venezuela of cash, thrown hundreds of thousands of employees out of work, stalled drilling and pipeline investments around the world and even reverberated into ancillary industries such as steel-making and railroads.\n\nExxon was one of the last holdouts against the wave of credit downgrades that engulfed oil drillers with diminishing prospects of paying debts, dividends and rig fees.\n\nThe downgrade will not only raise Exxon's cost to borrow money but may also erode its status among oil-rich governments as a premier partner with which to do business. As Exxon Vice President of Investor Relations Jeffrey Woodbury said in February, the company's AAA rating was a key selling point when competing for drilling licenses.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

The Tokyo-based company forecast profit could dwindle to to 92 billion yen by this time next year, and that a stronger yen may cost it 160 billion yen in revenue.\n\nKomatsu blamed \"declining sales of mining equipment against the backdrop of slack demand as well as drastically reduced demand in China and other emerging countries\" for its full-year result.\n\nIts fourth-quarter net income showed a 10 per cent decline on the year to 33.6 billion yen, while sales fell 11 per cent, according to a presentation to reporters in Tokyo.\n\nA three month-old upswing in commodities has yet to benefit the manufacturers of mining machinery, after customers reduced purchases amid a long retreat in prices from their 2011 peak.\n\nCaterpillar Inc, the industry leader with revenue almost three times that of Komatsu, cut its earnings forecasts last week, questioning whether the commodities rally is sustainable.\n\nOver the year, Komatsu's sales fell most in China, down 32 per cent, while the biggest gain was seen in North America, up 23 per cent. The company said that demand for mining equipment will drop by a further 15 to 20 per cent, while currency will have a big impact on its earnings this year if the yen remains relatively strong.\n\nThe yen rose above 108 to the dollar earlier this month, a level not seen since 2014, making Japanese exports less competitive.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

They take material from loads of different sites,\" Prof Beckett said, adding that it has a young and speedy workforce.\n\nYet although the site generated nearly \u00a373 million in revenue last year, mainly through advertising, DMGT admits the freely accessible site is not yet profitable, saying it needs to tip the \u00a3100 million mark.\n\nOnline advertising also faces the road bumps of ad-blocking software and the smaller space available on smartphones and tablets.\n\nCompetition is fierce from sites such as Buzzfeed and Vice, which have proved to be highly skilled in creating video content - a rapidly growing area.\n\n\"Integrating video is very expensive but people want more and more of it,\" said Mr Lechevallier. \"We're in a kind of race that makes this business model totally unstable.\"\n\nMailOnline \"is definitely ahead of the others but it still doesn't have the perfect business formula\".\n\nMaking a move to buy Yahoo can be explained by the fact that the maturing Internet continues to reward research and analysis services, which could help MailOnline to grow.\n\nThe US Internet giant has also itself absorbed new gems such as microblogging site Tumblr and the image sharing website Flickr, which the British group could hope to leverage to drive more traffic to its site - while relying on the large assets of Yahoo to achieve economies of scale.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The subdued global growth expected in 2016 reflects the low nominal growth in many advanced economies - the trend in the years after the global financial crisis.\n\n\"Confronted with weak demand from these economies, as well as China, growth in the rest of emerging Asia is expected to stay tepid,\" said MAS.\n\nAnd as global financial conditions tighten, domestic demand growth in the region will be impeded by rising debt service burdens. \"The softness in emerging Asia's growth will, in turn, spill back into activity in the advanced economies,\" MAS said.\n\nGlobal inflation is likely to stay muted in 2016, but may rise further next year, alongside the mild pick-up in economic activity, MAS said.\n\nEconomic activity in Singapore appears to have weakened across more sectors into the first quarter, MAS said. \"Besides pockets of the trade-related industries, the modern services and consumer-facing services sectors also turned in a muted performance.\"\n\nThe Singapore economy grew by 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, unchanged from the previous quarter, flash estimates this month showed. While this beat market forecasts, growth was flat on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, a contrast to the 6.2 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe MAS this month flattened the slope of the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) band, to reflect an updated forecast of a milder increase in core inflation. MAS now expects core inflation this year to come in within the lower half of the 0.5-1.5 per cent forecast range.\n\nCore inflation - which excludes accommodation and private road transport costs - was at 0.6 per cent in March, slightly higher than February's 0.5 per cent, MAS and the Ministry of Trade and Industry said this week.\n\n\"On the domestic front, labour market tightness is expected to ease further,\" MAS said in its review. Wage growth is expected to soften from 3.5 per cent in 2015 to about 2.5-3 per cent in 2016, although it will continue to be uneven across sectors, the central bank said.\n\n\"Together with a modest increase in productivity gains, aggregate unit labour cost growth is expected to moderate this year. The overall pass-through of domestic costs to consumer prices will continue to be constrained by subdued economic activity.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 68-year-old, however, did not file his nomination papers in the end.\n\nCampaigning for the by-election will run for nine days until May 5.

R&R Chief Executive Ibrahim Najafi will be CEO.\n\nEven though Nestle has a stated goal of becoming a more health-focussed company, it will keep its stronger ice cream businesses in Asia and most of the Americas, and its position as the world's second-largest ice cream company, behind Unilever .\n\nFinancial terms were not disclosed, but the venture will be a close No. 3 player, with annual sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs (S$3.75 billion) and 15,000 employees.\n\nLONDON LISTING\n\nFroneri will be based in the United Kingdom, where it plans to eventually list on the London Stock Exchange.\n\n\"Long term, the objective will be to list the entity as we believe this will be quite an attractive growth story. We think it's a natural outcome,\" said Frederic Stevenin, partner at PAI.\n\nAside from the ice cream businesses of Nestle and R&R, which makes Cadbury Flake Cones and other frozen treats, Froneri will include Nestle's European frozen food business, excluding pizza in Italy, and its chilled dairy business in the Philippines.\n\nThe executives declined to comment on the possibility of job cuts, saying the initial focus would be on growing sales, such as by filling gaps in the respective distribution networks. \"The strengths will come from innovation and from pushing growth because we believe there is a fantastic potential in a lot of countries where we could develop new propositions,\" Mr Cantarell said. \"Then time will tell how the company will work.\"\n\nFollowing integration, the company would also be open to mergers and acquisitions, he said. \"We will look at all possibilities.\"\n\nNestle has other joint ventures, with US cereal maker General Mills and one with French dairy firm Lactalis.\n\nThe deal is expected to close around the end of the year, subject to employee consultations and regulatory approval.\n\nNestle was advised by Credit Suisse, while PAI was advised by Rothschild.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/9a4d4a1b02fa67c3b637193330dcd4fd36dba91f6d2334d565e15c7f6a2d7c0a?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Nestle has struck a deal with Britain's R&R Ice Cream to form a joint venture that will sell ice cream and frozen food in over 20 countries, its latest attempt to adapt to a changing and more competitive packaged food market."}]}

When asked directly, most investors in American fund firms are critical of CEO pay packages, according to a national Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nAmong respondents, 59 per cent said chief executives at S&P 500 companies were paid \"too much,\" and 56 per cent said mutual fund firms \"should challenge executive pay more often.\"\n\nThe survey was conducted between March 22 and March 31. It included 1,024 people who said they invested with one or more of five top asset managers and 722 people who said they had at least some understanding of what a fund manager is. It has a credibility interval of about 4 per centage points.\n\nThe poll results underscore a growing angst over large-company CEO pay, which now runs more than 300 times that of US rank-and-file workers, according to a study by the AFL-CIO, the largest US federation of unions.\n\nMany CEOs at major companies have pay packages worth US$10 million or more.\n\nOne poll participant, Fargo, North Dakota cabdriver Brent Hartz, said CEO pay is often \"ridiculous\" and worries that managers of funds he owns - such as the US$50 billion Vanguard Growth Index Fund - are too cozy with corporate chiefs. \"It's almost like they're in cahoots with each other,\" Mr Hartz said in a telephone interview.\n\nAsset managers hold about 30 per cent of US corporate stock, giving them great influence over executive compensation and other corporate governance issues. Retail investors have about 89 per cent of the nearly US$16 trillion held in mutual funds, according to trade group Investment Company Institute.\n\nAll of the five large firms - BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments, State Street Corp and T. Rowe Price - emphasize that executive pay should be linked to company financial performance. Their voting history, however, shows that they rarely use their ballots to challenge compensation packages for perceived underperformance.\n\nLast year, the firms cast their advisory \"say on pay\" votes in support of senior executives 96 per cent of the time or more at S&P 500 firms, according to research firm Proxy Insight.\n\nThat level of support was typical for recent years, as median pay among S&P 500 CEOs rose to US$11.3 million in 2014 from US$9.4 million in 2010, according to pay consultant Farient Advisors.\n\nBig fund firms are facing more questions about their pay votes. BlackRock faces a shareholder proposal that calls for the world's largest asset manager to report on how it might bring its voting practices in line with its stated support of linking pay and performance. BlackRock calls such a report unnecessary.\n\nBlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said the firm believes that talking privately with company officials is the best way to address pay issues. Last year, the firm engaged with about 700 US companies and focused on executive compensation matters in 45 per cent of those meetings, he said.\n\nVanguard spokeswoman Linda Wolohan said via email that executive pay \"is a matter on which people have a wide variety of views (as supported by your survey results).\"\n\nPay is just one factor Vanguard considers in its proxy voting and it often addresses pay issues with company boards privately, she said.\n\nFidelity spokesman Charlie Keller said that its funds \"are managed with one overriding goal: To provide the greatest possible return.\" Spokespeople for T Rowe Price and State Street declined to comment.\n\nPublicly-traded US companies were required to submit the pay of their top executives for advisory votes by their investors under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act. With thousands of votes to cast each year through electronic platforms, the companies each have their own governance specialists to oversee their voting decisions.\n\nRetired Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank, one of the act's creators, has suggested that funds with highly paid executives make poor overseers of CEO pay.\n\nBlackRock CEO Laurence Fink, for instance, made US$25.8 million last year.\n\nSeveral leaders of union and state pension funds, which vote against executive pay more often, said the Reuters/Ipsos poll results suggest that most investors want funds to take a harder line.\n\n\"Ultimately, it has got to be driven by their clients,\" said Mike McCauley, a governance officer for the Florida State Board of Administration, which manages US$178 billion.\n\nMany respondents supported the status quo. Thirty per cent said S&P 500 CEOs are paid \"about right\" and 21 per cent said the fund firms \"are taking the correct approach\" on pay.\n\nIn Byron Center, Michigan, retired Army officer Gabe Hudson worries that the government might step in to regulate executive pay. \"If you think the CEOs are getting paid too much, you can always pull your money out of the fund and go to another fund,\" Mr Hudson said in an interview.\n\nThe poll did not ask about societal issues of income inequity, but many respondents brought it up in interviews. Some also acknowledged they don't carefully monitor proxy votes.\n\nBarbara Dixon, a retired school teacher who lives in South Carolina, said she has not closely followed such votes at the US$15 billion Fidelity Magellan Fund where some of her money is invested.\n\nStill, she wants the fund to play a role controlling in executive pay. \"Someone who is making millions of dollars does not need all that money,\" she said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Viewership of a presumably \"safer\" group of articles about US government security forces decreased much less in the same period.\n\nMr Penney's results, subjected to peer-review, offer a deeper dive into an issue investigated by previous researchers, including some who found a 5.0 per cent drop in Google searches for sensitive terms immediately after June 2013. Other surveys have found sharply increased use of privacy-protecting Web browsers and communications tools.\n\nMr Penney's work may provide fodder for technology companies and others arguing for greater restraint and disclosure about intelligence-gathering. Chilling effects are notoriously difficult to document and so have limited impact on laws and court rulings.\n\nMore immediately, the research could aid a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Wikipedia's nonprofit parent organization and other groups against the NSA and the Justice Department.\n\nThe year-old suit argues that intelligence collection from backbone Internet traffic carriers violated the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

White House backing has eased the way for the legislation's likely enactment into law.\n\nTheft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, is estimated to cost American firms more than US$300 billion a year, according to a 2013 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.\n\nTrade secret theft already is a federal crime, but without the right to sue in federal court, companies must seek redress in state courts amid a patchwork of state laws.\n\nCorporations such as Boeing Co and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce and computer software lobbyists representing companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, have pushed for the enhanced protections.\n\nBackers of the legislation have cited a case last year in which a South Korean company, Kolon Industries, was found guilty in US federal court of conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont.\n\nThe foreign firm was ordered to pay US$85 million in criminal fines and US$275 million in restitution for illegally obtaining information on the chemical company's Kevlar body armor, which resulted in nearly US$1 billion in economic losses for DuPont, according to lawmakers.\n\nIn allowing civil suits in federal court for illegal procurement of trade secrets including manufacturing processes, formulas, computer algorithms, industrial designs, business strategies and customer lists, the legislation aims to create uniform standards for what constitutes trade secret theft.\n\n\"In today's digital environment, it has never been easier to transfer trade secrets across the globe with the click of a cell phone, tablet, or computer key,\" said Representative Jerrold Nadler, the leading Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

There might be some light at the end of the tunnel though.\n\n\"As global trade volume keeps falling this will likely stunt our export growth, but in April we saw some positive indicators out of China,\" said Kim Doo-un, economist at Hana Financial Investment. \"We may see some improvement from that end, in terms of IT products and cosmetics.\" China posted its slowest economic growth since 2009 in the first quarter, data showed earlier this month, but other activity indicators were better than expected thanks to a surge of new debt there.\n\nApril this year had 22.5 working days, compared to 24 days in the same month last year.\n\nThe Reuters poll predicted imports to be down 12.5 per cent in April.\n\nThe same survey forecast March industrial output to have edged up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent on-month, slowing from a 3.3 per cent gain in February which was the fastest growth in 6-1/2 years.\n\nLee Sang-jae, chief economist at Eugene Investment & Securities, said factory output probably benefited from new smartphone and car releases. However, it would be premature to say the economy is on track for a strong rebound given the still-weak external trade picture.\n\nApril inflation is expected at 1.0 per cent on-month, unchanged from March, the polled showed, underpinned by a bounce in global oil prices and gains in housing costs as more South Koreans tend to move as the weather gets warmer in spring months.\n\nThat would still leave inflation lower than the central bank's target of 2 per cent.\n\nMarch industrial output data will be released on April 29 while April trade numbers are to be announced May 1.

The 10-year contract added 3.5 ticks to 97.3900 in a bullish steepening of the curve.\n\nThe 20-year contract eased 1.5 ticks to 96.7650.\n\nThe spread between 10- and 3-year cash bonds increased to 67 basis points, the widest since mid-February.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar also struggled after domestic data showed a wider-than-expected trade deficit.\n\nIt fell 0.3 per cent to US$0.6880 after New Zealand posted an annual trade deficit of NZ$3.838 billion (S$3.56 billion), the largest in seven years.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast a monthly surplus of NZ$475.5 million and an annual deficit of NZ$3.56 billion.\n\nThe next focus is on central bank announcements, beginning with the Federal Reserve and followed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.\n\nMost analysts polled expect the RBNZ to hold rates at 2.25 per cent on Thursday, but markets are pricing an easing as a 50-50 chance.\n\n\"Trading should be light ahead of tomorrow morning's double header with the FOMC and RBNZ statements out within a few hours of each other,\" said BNZ Currency Strategist Jason Wong.\n\n\"The combination of a slightly more hawkish Fed and an RBNZ easing would help take the NZD below US$0.6800.\" New Zealand government bonds were mixed across the curve with yields slightly lower at the short end and slightly higher at the long end.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

That olive branch is expected to cost the Korean company almost US$9 billion upfront.\n\nSamsung is in talks with Apple to be the exclusive supplier of displays for iPhone models scheduled for release next year, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The company would need to spend the money building capacity for the technology, which is thinner, brighter and less draining on the battery than those in most current smartphones.\n\nThe potential deal to supply Apple with OLED screens - first reported by the Maeil Business Newspaper - may help Samsung reverse two years of dwindling smartphone market share, revenue and net income. The consumer-electronics giant in January warned of a gloomy 2016, so locking in Apple may attract Chinese smartphone vendors wanting to upgrade their devices to stay competitive.\n\n\"It looks like a huge investment risk for Samsung at first, but it will pay off handsomely,\" said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities in Seoul. \"Once Apple adopts the new display, others can't help but follow.\"\n\nSubsidiary Samsung Display may spend at least 10 trillion won (S$11.8 billion) beefing up OLED capacity, the Maeil reported, citing sources it didn't identify. Apple sold more than 231 million iPhones last year, and Samsung Display made about 3 million screens a month. Just to keep pace, Samsung would have to boost production by a factor of at least six.\n\nSamsung Electronics owns 85 per cent of Samsung Display as part of an intricate web of cross-shareholdings in the conglomerate. Samsung Display, based in Yongin, declined to comment in an e-mail.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman in South Korea didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nSamsung Electronics will report audited first-quarter results on Thursday, including net income and divisional performances. Analysts estimate profit of 4.42 trillion won, or a 2 per cent decline from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nShares of Samsung rose 0.2 per cent to 1,299,000 won as of 10:37 am in Seoul. The stock has risen 3.1 per cent this year after posting three straight annual declines.\n\nSamsung posted better-than-expected preliminary operating profit of 6.6 trillion won on April 7 after releasing its Galaxy S7 phones about a month earlier than usual to capitalize on the lull in new Apple products. First-quarter sales of 49 trillion won slightly exceeded analyst estimates.\n\nIn the past four weeks, eight analysts raised their estimates by an average of 281.1 billion won.\n\n\"It's great news for Samsung,\" Chung Won Suk, a Seoul-based analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co, said of the potential Apple supply deal. \"Samsung will exclusively get the initial orders from Apple in late 2017 for the flagship lines, and it will get the price premium.\"\n\nMaking a multibillion-dollar commitment to Apple hasn't always worked out for suppliers. In 2014, GT Advanced Technologies Inc filed for bankruptcy after it couldn't produce sapphire screens of usable quality for iPhones. Filings by GT Advanced called the terms of its deal with Apple \"onerous.\"\n\nSamsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae Yong is trying to accelerate a diversification beyond phones, which depend on Google's Android operating system and compete with hundreds of Chinese makers, including Huawei Technologies Co, Xiaomi Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd.\n\nThe mobile division generated 103.6 trillion won in sales last year - or 52 per cent of Samsung's total, the company said.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales are expected to increase by just 7 per cent this year, the slowest rate in the product's history, according to Gartner Inc. About 150 million users in Asia will delay upgrading in the next three years while they wait for prices to come down, the researcher said.\n\nSales of another key product for Samsung - TVs - declined 0.3 per cent last year and are only expected to grow by 3 per cent this year, helped by the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The sluggish growth is affecting Samsung shares, which have declined about 7 per cent during the past 12 months.\n\nDuring the same period, Apple shares plunged 21 per cent. Sales will fall for a second straight quarter, a forecast that missed analyst estimates, as growth stalls in the smartphone market, the company said Tuesday. The lower-cost iPhone SE released in March targeted new customers in emerging markets such as China and India.\n\nSamsung gets about 4.8 per cent of its 200.7 trillion won in revenue from supplying Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At least three Samsung Group companies provide the Cupertino, California-based company with displays, memory chips and batteries.\n\nSales of OLED displays should almost double to 21.5 trillion won next year from 11.2 trillion won last year, Peter Yu, a Seoul-based analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said in an April 15 report. Top-of-the-line Galaxy smartphones also should start using the displays next year, Mr Yu wrote in raising his price target on the stock.\n\nSamsung was one of the biggest makers of chips and displays for Apple until the companies started suing each other in 2011 for alleged patent infringements. Samsung invested in a flash-memory factory after Apple said it wanted to switch from hard-disk drives in its iPods. Yet that relationship progressively soured, and Apple depended on alternative suppliers, including LG Display Co, Sharp Corp and Japan Display Inc.\n\nThose rivals have come to depend on work for Apple and in each case are its biggest customer. Apple generates 42 per cent of Japan Display's sales, 31 per cent of LG Display's and 20 per cent of Sharp's, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn 2014, Apple and Samsung dropped all lawsuits against each other outside the US, with Samsung agreeing in December to pay US$548 million. And, last year, Samsung created a standalone team of about 200 employees working exclusively on Apple products, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\n\"When Apple starts adopting the new screens for its iPhones from 2017, that will be the trigger to change the whole smartphone industry landscape to OLEDs,\" said Park Ki-Bum, a Seoul-based analyst at BNK Securities Co.\n\n\"If the world's two biggest smartphone makers are leading the technical changes, it is almost certain that Chinese brands will follow their path.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Chip profits - which accounted for just under half of its overall 2015 operating income - are widely expected to fall, with some analysts predicting a drop of more than 10 per cent in January-March from a year earlier.\n\nBut if its rivals are getting pummelled, the South Korean tech giant is merely bruised and is in many ways benefiting as clients shift towards premium power-conserving DRAM chips for smartphones, as well as solid-state drives for data storage using 3D NAND chips.\n\n\"The technological gap between Samsung and its competitors in fields such as DRAM and NAND has been widening lately, which helps the company avoid the rate of profit decline seen at other firms,\" said Song Myung-sub, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.\n\nEven with a first-quarter drop of around 10 per cent, Samsung's chip operating profit is expected to be nearly five times that of SK Hynix.\n\nThe world's No 2 chipmaker also happens to run the world's biggest smartphone business, giving it a captive customer for its chips that none of its rivals have.\n\n\"This is a safehouse they can go to,\" said Avril Wu, an analyst at research firm Trendforce.\n\nHealthy initial sales for Samsung's new flagship Galaxy S7 smartphones are expected to be the main driver of first-quarter operating profit, which the firm has said likely rose 10.4 per cent from a year earlier to 6.6 trillion won (S$7.84 billion).\n\nDOMINANT POSITION\n\nOf its key products, analysts are most upbeat about Samsung's NAND chip prospects. Samsung was the first to mass produce NAND flash chips using a technology called 3D NAND, helping it assume a dominant position in higher-margin products such as solid-state hard drives for computers and servers.\n\nBNP Paribas expects the South Korean firm's NAND revenue to climb 16 per cent and NAND operating profit to jump 69 per cent this year.\n\nShipments will also likely outpace the industry average, allowing Samsung to seize more market share, it said in a report.\n\nThe technology is already contributing to Samsung's profits, analysts say, adding that this is not the case for main NAND rivals Toshiba Corp, SK Hynix and Micron Technology Inc which are estimated to be as much as three years behind.\n\nInvestors and analysts also point to Samsung's superior production technology for DRAM chips, saying the firm is ahead of its closest rivals by at least a year.\n\nIt can mass produce smaller chips than rivals, which boosts performance and conserves power as well as increasing the number that can be made from a single wafer.\n\nSamsung commanded 58 per cent of the mobile DRAM market as of the fourth quarter of 2015, according to TrendForce.

Schools will be closed on Fridays starting this week, he said.\n\n\"The public sector will work Monday and Tuesday, while we go through these critical and extreme weeks where we are doing everything to save the Guri,\" Mr Maduro said, referring to the giant hydroelectric dam that has become like a \"desert\". The collection of electricity-saving measures have reduced Guri's daily drop from 22 centimetres a day to 10 centimetres, he added.\n\nVenezuela is requesting emergency international help from the United Nations for public works construction to help the country recover from an \"extreme situation,\" Mr Maduro said. He called for \"social peace\" during the power crisis.\n\nVenezuelans, except those in Caracas and some states, began to experience programmed four-hour rolling blackouts on Monday as a drought cripples generation at the Guri dam. It's the latest blow to an economy that the International Monetary Fund forecasts will contract 8 per cent this year, after shrinking 5.7 per cent in 2015.\n\nWater levels at Guri dam reached a record low of 241.67 metres on Monday, according to state power utility Corpoelec. If levels drop below 240 metres, the dam's operator may be forced to shut down units at the plant that produces about 75 per cent of the electricity that Caracas, the country's capital and largest city, consumes.\n\nMr Maduro ordered the country's time zone changed this month to save energy, reversing the decision by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, to set back clocks 30 minutes in 2007 to ease daily predawn commutes for school children and the poor. Clocks will be moved forward a half hour May 1.\n\nThe president decreed Fridays as holidays for state workers through May as part of plans to save electricity after ordering a week-long break over the Easter holiday last month. Mr Maduro said those efforts saved almost 22 centimetres of water at the Guri dam in the southern state of Bolivar.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Can we turn this year off and turn it back on when it stops being a giant exit for all the most talented people?\" The actress Minnie Driver echoed the thoughts of many in tweeting her reaction to the sudden loss of Prince, the latest in a long list of entertainers who died in 2016.\n\nSimilar comments flooded social media, along with somber opinion pieces in newspapers and magazines on what has so far been a dark year for the celebrity galaxy.\n\n\"All the adults that affected me in my childhood are making an exodus one by one,\" the hip-hop producer Questlove wrote on Instagram.\n\nPrince's death at age 57 came three months after David Bowie, another of music's leading lights, succumbed to cancer at age 69.\n\nOther notable deaths this year in the industry include the so-called \"Fifth Beatle\" George Martin, dead at 90; Earth, Wind & Fire founder Maurice White, who was 74; Paul Kantner, the co-founder of Jefferson Airplane, also 74.\n\nThe music world was plunged into mourning once again at the weekend with the death of soul great Billy Paul - he of Me and Mrs Jones fame - at age 81.\n\nOutside the music world, high-profile recent deaths in the entertainment industry include British actor Alan Rickman, who was 69. Britain has lost a host of actors, performers or television personalities this year, many of them from the same era.\n\nSo has 2016 really been the year when the grim reaper took aim at the stars?\n\nFor Nick Serpell, obituary editor for the BBC, the number of notable deaths in 2016 has been \"phenomenal.\"\n\n\"This past year by objective measure has been a year of notable deaths in the music world,\" agreed Shaun Tandon, AFP's music correspondent in New York who pointed also to Glenn Frey of The Eagles, and Natalie Cole and Lemmy of Motorhead, both of whom died at the end of 2015.\n\nThe deaths of Prince and Bowie - both living legends - would have had a massive ripple effect no matter when they died.\n\nBut social media also amplifies the way we experience celebrity deaths.\n\n\"When, say, Otis Redding died in a 1967 plane crash, plenty of fans were grieving but they could not instantly open their computers and commiserate and create a larger movement of grief,\" Tandon said.\n\n\"Suddenly everyone has a platform - and might even feel an obligation to share.\" Stef Woods, a professor of American Studies at American University in the capital Washington, agrees there has been a steady stream of celebrity deaths.\n\nBut there are also a lot more celebrities out there, as well as chances to \"share and be involved with the lives and work of our cultural icons,\" Woods, who specializes in pop culture and social media, told AFP.\n\n\"Our grandparents' generation, there wasn't the same... opportunity to share someone's work through a variety of mediums, or follow somebody on Instagram, or hear their music on Tidal or Spotify, or see a movie on YouTube.\"\n\nLike Serpell, Prof Woods predicts that the apparent spike of high-profile deaths will become the norm as the stars of the baby-boomer generation, roughly born 1946 to 1964, hit their mid-50s and beyond.\n\n\"David Bowie, Alan Rickman, they fall within the baby-boomer years,\" she says.\n\nBut, she adds, we also feel like more people are dying because we are \"inundated\" with information by rolling news channels and digital media that chart every painful step in a celebrity's illness, the details of their death, the funeral and the impact on their family.\n\n\"For some it is a source of comfort,\" says Prof Woods. \"For others, it is overwhelming.\n\n\"We are losing someone that we feel close to and has been a part of our lives for decades.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Some 108 companies on the Topix report earnings Wednesday.\n\nWith policy makers and investors assessing data to judge the strength of the US economy, a report Tuesday showed orders for US durable goods climbed less than expected in March. A separate reading on home prices in 20 US cities rose less than forecast in February from a year earlier, while consumer confidence decreased more than predicted in April.\n\n\"We may see weaker volume as investors hold off ahead of the Fed meeting today and the BOJ tomorrow,\" IG's Mr Nicholson said. \"Speculation is pretty high that we're going to see some sort of announcement of further easing from the BOJ, particularly with regard to an increase in ETF purchases, a benefit to the equity market.\"\n\nE-mini futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 0.2 per cent after the underlying gauge rose 0.2 per cent Tuesday as a rally in oil prices boosted commodity producers. Crude extended gains on Wednesday from the highest level in more than five months as U.S. industry data showed a decline in stockpiles.\n\nApple shares fell as much as 8.3 per cent in after-hours US trading. Sales in the third quarter, which ends in June, will be US$41 billion to US$43 billion, the Cupertino, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. On average, analysts estimated revenue of US$47.4 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.8 per cent after bets surged that the central bank will cut interest rates next month. Inflation unexpectedly slowed in the first quarter, a report showed Wednesday.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi index and New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 Index both slid 0.2 per cent. Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 0.5 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.1 per cent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland stocks traded in the city rose 0.2 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index was little changed.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Capital Markets & Currencies\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust\u2019s proposed privatisation by sponsor gets SGX in-principle approval\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 AM\n\nStocks to watch: OCBC, SGX, Centurion, Sats, Frasers Property, Frasers Hospitality Trust\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:39 AM\n\nAims Financial Group raises stake in Aims Apac Reit to 18.7%\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:35 AM\n\nUS dollar has best week since February on tariff inflation risks\n\nJul 12, 2025 11:52 AM\n\nEurope: Stocks down with bank and healthcare drag, US-EU tariffs in focus\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:56 AM\n\nUS: Stocks edge down from records amid tariff threats\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:45 AM\n\nSingapore stocks notch 5-day rally ahead of GDP data\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:06 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM", "images": []}

namely the junior doctors and all that work with them - than supporting the NHS and people that keep us all alive,\" Mr Corbyn said.\n\nWhile there have been several recent walk-outs, this one affected hospital emergency care such as accident and emergency (A&E) and maternity units for the first time, although senior doctors and nurses were to remain on duty.\n\nEngland has around 50,000 junior doctors, who are graduates with years of experience who have yet to complete their professional qualifications.\n\nThe walk-out runs from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm (0700 GMT to 1600 GMT) on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\"This is the saddest day of my professional life,\" said Fiona Martin, 36, at a picket outside St Thomas' Hospital in central London, in the shadow of parliament.\n\n\"I never thought as a doctor I would be forced to put down my stethoscope but we have been forced into it by a government that refuses to listen,\" she told AFP.\n\nA key sticking point in the dispute has been how much financial compensation junior doctors should get for working on Saturdays.\n\nThe government has proposed treating most of Saturday like a weekday, cutting down on overtime pay.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' trade union, has not ruled out an open-ended strike or mass resignations as a way of trying to force the government's hand on the issue.\n\nBut health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the new contract was a \"very fair deal\" that rewarded junior doctors better than paramedics, police officers and fire officers for working unsociable weekend hour and accused the BMA of blackmail.\n\n\"We have too many heartbreaking stories, parents who have lost children, people who have lost loved ones, because we are not delivering high-quality care at the weekend,\" Mr Hunt said.\n\nThe taxpayer-funded NHS, established in 1948, is one of Britain's most respected institutions, providing largely free medical care.\n\nWhile it has been shielded from austerity cuts to public services under Mr Cameron, experts warn it still faces increasing financial strain due to factors like rising treatment costs and an ageing population.\n\nMr Cameron's government argues that reforms to junior doctors' contracts are necessary to ensure that the quality of care for patients is as high at weekends as it is during the week.\n\nThe prime minister has quoted research claiming mortality rates for patients admitted to hospital on a Sunday can be 16 per cent higher than on a Wednesday, though doctors question this.\n\nAn Ipsos Mori poll for BBC News found that 57 per cent of the general public supported the doctors while a quarter opposed their actions.\n\nMr Hunt announced in February that he intended to impose the new contract on junior doctors after they rejected his \"best and final offer\".\n\nThere are signs the dispute is getting more entrenched.\n\n\"Both sides seem to be digging in their heels,\" warned Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia says trade permit required for AI chips of US origin\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nSouth Korea trade envoy: may be able to strike framework deal with US by August 1 deadline\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM\n\nAI is already showing signs of slashing job openings in the UK\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:30 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nNew Zealand spending slowdown adds to signs of cooling economy\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:54 AM\n\nChina\u2019s growth seen outpacing target, easing stimulus pressure\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:49 AM\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nUK government to make new push to cut red tape for businesses aiming to cut emissions\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:13 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/e1cfb93df6b7435dcda4878c3b2bab165ce87a023a8cbbfbf999963bbe2d346c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Junior doctors in England staged their first ever all-out strike Tuesday in a bitter row with Prime Minister David Cameron's government over pay and conditions."}]}

It's buying startup Withings to jolt your memory\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 26, 2016 \u00b7 11:55 PM\n\n[PARIS] About a decade after Apple Inc's iPhone first hit the market, Nokia Oyj is seeking to relaunch its consumer business with health bands and connected scales by acquiring French startup Withings SAS.\n\nIt's out to revive a brand that was once one of Europe's most valuable, but has slipped further as Nokia sold its phone business to Microsoft Corp two years ago to focus on telecommunications networks.\n\n\"The longer you're out of a market, the more your brand value declines,\" Ramzi Haidamus, who heads the Nokia Technologies unit from San Francisco, said in an interview in Paris.\n\n\"Today, we're coming back to consumers' hands - we're inverting that decline.\"\n\nNokia said Tuesday it's buying Withings in a deal that values the startup, based near the French capital, at 170 million euros (S$259 million). Withings, which has about 200 employees, doesn't disclose financials. The Nokia brand was worth 3.2 billion euros at the end of last year, and the company re-evaluates that estimate each year in its accounts, Mr Haidamus said.\n\n\"Studies show us Nokia is a trusted brand,\" Mr Haidamus said. \"So it's very compatible with health.\"\n\nNokia said it'll decide on re-branding Withings' products when the transaction closes in the third quarter.\n\nSales of wearable consumer devices such as health bands will make up US$32 billion in sales by 2019, about three times the 2013 level, according to a report by researcher IHS.\n\nNokia's brand value topped out at ninth globally in 2008 at US$33 billion, plummeted to US$2 billion in 2014 and has since rebounded a bit to US$3 billion this year, but still falls outside the top 500, according to data from Brand Finance.\n\nSince selling its mobile-phones unit to Microsoft, Nokia Technologies has focused mostly on licensing patents. It dipped a toe back into the consumer segment with an Android-based tablet built by Foxconn Technology Group unveiled in 2014, and started advertising a virtual-reality camera for professionals last year.\n\nMixed trends on the network side of its business may have given Nokia extra motivation to make a consumer-focused comeback and seek new revenue.\n\nPhone carriers have spent billions in recent years on faster wireless networks, but with much of the networks already built, investments are expected to slump by 7 per cent this year and another 5 per cent in 2017, according to predictions by Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nMeanwhile, Nokia's phones have fallen off the map. Microsoft in July unveiled plans to cut jobs and write down about US$7.6 billion on its mobile unit, wiping out nearly the entire value of a business that failed to gain market share since it was acquired.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows Phone software still commands less than 5 per cent of the market for mobile operating systems, according to researcher IDC.\n\n\"In its golden years, Nokia built a great brand in the mobile telephone market,\" IHS analyst Antonios Maroulis wrote in a note.\n\n\"Nokia still believes its brand holds value and has maintained trust, despite all of the calamities that ensued since Windows Phone.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

The move may have been an effort to show that it can and does use the White House process and disclose hacking methods when it can.\n\nThe flaw the FBI disclosed to Apple this month did nothing to change the company's perception that the White House process is less effective than has been claimed, said an Apple executive who declined to be named.\n\nThough he declined to provide technical details, the executive said the problem had been fixed by the company nine months ago, with the release of iOS9 for phones and Mac OS X El Capitan.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of iPhones are on a safe version of the operating system, and Apple said it does not plan to issue a patch for the older software.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Without that, the FBI could not share it even if it wanted to, sources said.\n\nReuters reported on April 13 that the unnamed contractor had sole ownership of the method it used, making it unlikely that the government could share it.\n\nA day later, the FBI warned Apple of a separate flaw in its iPhone and Mac software, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nIt was the first time the government had alerted Apple to a vulnerability under a White House interagency procedure, known as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, for reviewing technology security flaws and deciding which ones should be made public, the company said.\n\nThe FBI's provisional decision means that the unlocking mechanism used on the San Bernardino iPhone will not be referred to the interagency procedure for review.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, FBI director James Comey said his agency was assessing whether the mechanism would go through the review.\n\n\"We are in the midst of trying to sort that out,\" Mr Comey said.\n\nOfficials have said that the interagency review process leans toward disclosure of technological flaws. But it is not set up to handle or reveal flaws which are discovered and owned by private companies, sources have told Reuters.\n\nMr Comey's comments appeared to confirm the FBI did not own the method used to crack the county-owned work phone belonging to Syed Farook, who with his wife opened fire in December on a San Bernardino, California, holiday party, killing 14 and wounding 22.\n\nThe method instead belongs to a still-unidentified third party that the FBI said came forward due to the attention received from its public pursuit of a court order to compel Apple's assistance in unlocking the phone.\n\nApple's refusal to comply prompted a high-profile standoff and fueled a long-simmering debate over security, privacy and law enforcement access to encrypted technology.\n\nThe government withdrew its case after it said the hacking method worked. Mr Comey has said the method works on a \"narrow slice\" of iPhone 5c devices running iOS 9.\n\nAn Apple senior executive told reporters earlier this month that it was confident the flaw used by the third party would have a \"short shelf life\" and be patched through the firm's ongoing efforts to improve the security of its devices.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

The likelihood, or risk, of reaching any accord is fading.\"\n\nMr Fekl, who is France's envoy to the talks, added that there was no desire in Europe to \"sign up to anything at any price\".\n\nSpeaking on a visit to Germany, French Finance Minister Emmanuel Macron said \"there is no urgency\" to sign a deal which France has to be sure is \"complete, ambitious and which does not disown any of our interests\" but is drawn up \"fully transparently\".\n\nHis comments come a day after US and European negotiators opened a 13th round of talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership in New York, which are expected to last a week.\n\nShould the agreement succeed, it could give an economic boost of 120 billion euros (S$182 billion) to the EU and 95 billion euros to the United States by 2027, according to a 2013 study carried out by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research and financed by the European Commission.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Obama and German chancellor Angela Merkel made a joint pitch for more transatlantic trade, vowing to complete the US-EU pact in the face of mounting opposition in Europe.\n\nOn the eve of Mr Obama's visit to Germany, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the country against the proposed pact which has raised fears it would erode ecological and labour market standards, and in protest over the secrecy shrouding the talks.\n\nThe pact also faces a threat in the form of a British referendum on exiting the EU which is to take place in June.\n\nAs one of the largest trading economies of the bloc, Britain would play a major role in the pact, but if it votes to leave the EU, it could deal a devastating blow to trade pact's prospects.\n\nIt has also invoked growing anti-free trade talk in the US presidential election race and growing suspicions among the American public because details of the talks are secret.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Samsung Pay - another form of contactless payment all meant to replace the physical wallet with the phone - is coming soon, too.\n\nBut the big leap in contactless payment rests on another giant. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will pilot this year the use of contactless debit or credit cards for commuting. If implemented, it will go some length to refine a fragmented market for contactless payments, fractures which have been needless for a small country with smart nation ambitions.\n\nContactless payment has been offered in Singapore for a few years, and comes in several forms. There's one charge led by payment companies such as Visa and MasterCard, which allows customers to tap their credit cards on contactless payment terminals. A similar version is led by Singapore's payment system NETS. Starbucks is one retailer offering its own digital stored value card used by caffeine-on-drip patients.\n\nThe most critical charge comes from EZ-Link. EZ-Link announced that from March, those who have a compatible mobile phone can now tap their phones at gantries and card readers to pay for their train and bus trips.\n\nThe contactless payment movement led by EZ-Link - and aided by telcos - has lacked verve. Quite simply, consumers do not want to pay for a new SIM card to enable contactless payment. There are also just a small number of phones that have this function, and these exclude the iPhone.\n\nA looming problem remains with system compatibility. EZ-Link runs on a closed system that recognises a Singapore-specific standard for contactless payment, and requires the digital purse to be pre-funded. The best analogy to mind is the communication needed for an EZ-Link transaction to go through, is now in Singlish.\n\nLTA is effectively exploring an open system - what it dubs an account-based ticketing system - which will allow consumers to use contactless debit or credit cards for fare payments, it said in March. To follow the analogy, the communication will now be in business English. This should no longer tie the consumers' use of contactless payment to telcos' re-issuance of Singlish-speaking SIM cards. The pilot is set for the fourth quarter. If fully implemented, Singapore would move to the London model, which runs on an open system.\n\nThe real potential rests with LTA opening up its system. The scale is clear: bus and rail ridership hit a record of a daily average of 6.9 million in 2015. But the opening up has taken time.\n\nThat some banks here are engaging with Apple Pay before the big LTA ramp-up means they relented to paying a fee, so tech giants can teach them how to influence consumer behaviour. Apple may be leeching on banks' established customer base and infrastructure, but lenders have already had to yield to Apple, and other tech bigwigs, that raised demands from consumers. Customers now want services that are fast, secure and painless. Amid greater expectations, banks cannot ignore the risk of a mass migration of huffy customers.\n\nThe selling point for Apple to banks is made clearer when considering that the iPhone had only been introduced in 2007. Less than a decade later, people are surgically attached to their smartphones, their faces bathed in perpetual glow from reading off their screens, or watching a certain Korean drama involving soldiers, doctors and coincidentally, product placement to showcase contactless payment on Samsung phones.\n\nSticky loyalty is not just from adopting contactless payment. It is about keeping people comfortable with making payments on their mobile phones - a huge e-commerce market - that banks hope to make money off, or just to make payments easier so people spend. And as customers become more adapted to banking online, and on their phones, the use of cash - which is more expensive to process - can be trimmed. Over time, banking can become less costly.\n\nThe tuition fee for banks may also be lower than the reported 0.15 per cent on each purchase that Apple levies on banks in the United States. In China, the sizzling market for mobile payment, Chinese banks wrangled to pay around 0.07 per cent of each transaction to Apple, according to Chinese media Caixin. On top of that, Apple - which launched Apple Pay in China in February - will reportedly only collect fees in two years.\n\nIt is understood that Apple is negotiating fees separately with each bank here. Singapore banks' power play is different from that of Chinese banks. Lenders in China are eager to fend off fintechs such as Alibaba and Tencent, but offer Apple access into the world's most populous country, and one that is extremely adapted to mobile payments already. Samsung is reportedly charging no fee in China and anywhere else - no doubt meant to challenge Apple in this space.\n\nSingapore makes up for its lack of size with a consumer base that is eager to try out new technologies. As it is, it is the third-largest country in the world with the widest adoption of Visa payWave after Australia and New Zealand. Transaction volume has jumped close to 70 per cent from a year ago for contactless payments through Visa-issued cards.\n\nA larger surge in contactless payment from here on is easy to imagine. But LTA has to tap in.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I'm reasonably optimistic (about China), less so with Russia.\"\n\nMr Comey's comments were far more upbeat than those from National Security Agency chief Michael Rogers earlier this month on the implementation of last year's accord between President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.\n\nThe two leaders agreed on principles aimed at stemming what has been seen as a wave of hacking directed against US companies and organizations.\n\nMr Rogers told Congress earlier this month that Chinese hackers remain \"engaged in activity directed against US companies\" and that the \"jury is still out\" on whether China indeed passes intel to the business world.\n\nMr Comey, speaking at the Georgetown International Conference on Cyber Engagement, said the FBI was ramping up its ability to combat hacking and cybercrime.\n\n\"We think we have to be more predictive and less reactive,\" he said.\n\nPart of this strategy, he said involves \"naming people and shaming them\" to demonstrate costs of hacking into US computer systems.\n\nThe FBI, he said, wants to \"make people feel our breath on the back of their neck -- physically ideally, but metaphorically\" to deter hacking.\n\nMr Comey also reiterated concerns about the impact of strong encryption in the wake of the legal battle over access to the iPhone used by a California attacker.\n\n\"I'm very glad that the litigation between the FBI and Apple on San Bernardino has ended, because it really was about getting access to that phone,\" Mr Comey said, referring to the court case in which the FBI sought to compel Apple to help unlock the phone used by one of the shooters in last year's deadly attack.\n\nBut Mr Comey said it was still important to have a discussion on the topic because \"there is a collision going on between values of all shades between privacy and security.\"\n\nMr Comey said encryption and privacy are important but \"there has never been a time in the 240 years of our country when privacy has been absolute.\"\n\nHe added that he is concerned that defenders of strong encryption, which allows only the users to access data, have failed to consider all the implications.\n\n\"We are moving to a place in American life, because we live our lives on these devices, (where they) will be immune to the judicial process,\" he said.\n\n\"My only request is that we talk about the costs ... We should not drift to a place where wide swaths of American life become off limits to the judicial process without a serious, adult conversation.\"\n\nMr Comey had previously expressed concerns about \"warrant-proof\" spaces that allow criminals to evade detection as he debated Apple and its backers. Apple argued that enabling access would weaken security for all iPhone users and open doors for hackers and others.\n\nThe government ended its request after finding a way to access the phone with the help of a third party.\n\nMr Comey said the FBI has not yet decided whether to tell Apple about how it accessed the data.\n\nSome activists have said the FBI should tell Apple under a US policy aimed at helping tech companies plug security vulnerabilities.\n\nMr Comey said that \"we are in the process of sorting it out, we are close to a resolution but I'm not ready to make news on this.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

That's the money supply itself.\n\nMoney-supply growth used to be viewed as a crucial indicator for measuring the interaction between central banks and the economy. The theory, which goes back more than 200 years, is relatively simple. More money leads to more transactions, which in modern terms means more GDP. Weak money growth leads to a weak economy.\n\nThe money supply as an indicator worked well until the 1980s. Then the link seemingly broke down as the rapid expansion of new instruments such as money-market funds (MMFs) blurred the definition of money.\n\nClearly these were \"money\" in the sense that they could be used at some point to fund transactions, but because they were less liquid than cash or savings deposits, it was hard to quantify their relationship to growth. Before long, the measure of money seemed no longer to be linked to GDP trends, at least in the short and medium run. Now, the statistical tools finally exist to solve the problems economists encountered in the 1980s. Applying those tools can yield new insights. It's time to resurrect money supply as an indicator.\n\nThe relevant measure is known as \"Divisia money\" after the French economist Francois Divisia. Mr Divisia developed statistical tools that could assign different weights over time to different components of an index. In the context of money supply, this means new money-like products can be weighted according to their \"degree of moneyness\" which is inferred from the interest rate they earn. For example, when you earn a higher interest rate by buying an MMF or putting money in a time deposit instead of keeping it in your current account, you give up some liquidity. Chances are you only put the money in these instruments if you think you won't be spending it soon. So it is still potentially money, but the Divisia method gives it a lower weight than cash or current accounts.\n\nECONOMIC FORECASTING\n\nEconomists have worked since the 1980s to apply this approach to measuring the money supply, and the research is now at a point where a Divisia monetary index can be used for economic forecasting.\n\nDoing so yields some interesting results. Our Divisia measure of global money-supply growth has picked up in the last year, but is still well below pre-2008 levels. This suggests the global economic upswing will continue but will likely stay disappointing, and further stimulus will be necessary.\n\nThis is clearest in the US - Divisia money growth has accelerated in the past two years but remains less than 4 per cent, well below the 6 per cent to 7 per cent growth prevailing before 2008. This slow growth is despite low interest rates and quantitative easing, and underlines the headwinds facing the US.\n\nBusiness is still cautious in the face of the slowdown in China and other emerging markets, the slow recovery in Europe, as well as the effects of increased regulation and taxes at home. Slow money growth supports the view that the US Federal Reserve should raise interest rates only very slowly, if at all.\n\nIn other places, the message from Divisia money is surprisingly positive. Our forecast is for eurozone economic growth of only 1.4 per cent in 2016. But Divisia money growth in the eurozone - which has surged over the past year and is now running faster than in the US, UK or Japan - suggests Europe could spring a growth surprise.\n\nThis may mean quantitative easing (QE) has been more effective than people realise. Last week's expansion of the size of QE and also of the assets the ECB will buy will make it more effective still. With unemployment still over 10 per cent, the ECB shouldn't let up on its stimulus. But Divisia money suggests it is finally on the right track. There is similar good news from China, where Divisia money has also picked up in the past year. This likely reflects cuts in interest rates and reserve requirements as well as increased fiscal stimulus, and supports our above-consensus forecast of 6.8 per cent for China's economic growth in 2016.\n\nThis underlines an important advantage of the Divisia approach. Because of the uncertainty over exactly what is money these days, central banks have tended to look at narrow measures of money such as M1 and M2, if they look at any at all. By using the Divisia approach, we can resurrect broad measures of money as an economic signpost.\n\nAs other indicators become less effective in today's unusual economic and monetary environment, this new twist on an old statistic could give central banks and analysts a much-needed and powerful tool.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

For the full fiscal year, its DPU rose 1.6 per cent to 8.13 cents.\n\nNet property income during the quarter rose 3.5 per cent to S$55 million and grew 4.3 per cent to S$220.7 million over the full fiscal year. But the higher net property income was offset by higher net finance expenses and unrealised exchange loss arising from the translation of the medium-term notes dominated in Japanese yen into Singapore dollar.\n\nSaying this a steady set of results despite weak retail sentiments and office market, the Reit manager's CEO Sharon Lim said that the focus on active asset management and cost management has buoyed gross portfolio revenue and savings in operating expenses for the fiscal year.\n\nGross revenue was 1.9 per cent higher at S$287.8 million in fiscal 2016 ended March 31, thanks mainly to positive contributions from VivoCity and Merrill Lynch Harbourfront, partially offset by lower revenue from Mapletree Anson and PSA Building.\n\nProperty operating expenses were pared down by 5.3 per cent year on year to S$67 million for the fiscal year due largely to lower utilities expense from lower tariff rates and electricity consumption as well as savings in advertising and promotion expenses.\n\nMCT's porfolio occupancy inched up to 96.6 per cent as of March 31, from 95.7 per cent a year ago.\n\nIts largest portfolio property, VivoCity, racked up a 3.7 per cent and 7.2 per cent increase in gross revenue and net property income, largely driven by higher rental income from positive rental reversion, and the effects of the rental step-ups in existing leases.\n\nVivoCity's first asset enhancement initiative was fully completed in June last year, which generated some 15,000 sq ft of high-yielding retail space on Basement One. As at March 31, the overall occupancy rate for VivoCity was 99.6 per cent, up from 97.5 per cent a year ago.\n\nOccupancy rates at MCT's office assets, Mapletree Anson and PSA Building, stayed at above 90 per cent with committed occupancy at above 94 per cent. But transitional vacancy from some earlier expiring leases remained during the January-March quarter, resulting in a 1.1 per cent year-on-year decline in the fiscal year's office portfolio NPI (net property income).\n\nAt Merrill Lynch Harbourfront, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's lease has been renewed and restructured in April. Post-restructuring, the weighted average lease expiry for MCT's office assets has been extended from 2.8 years to 3.5 years.\n\nMCT's investment properties were revalued at 3.4 per cent higher at S$4.3 billion, underpinned by a strong performance by VivoCity. The upward revaluation of the portfolio assets pared MCT's aggregate leverage ratio to about 35 per cent. Post-refinancing of the debts, the weighted average term to maturity of debt was extended to about four years.\n\nAs of March 31, 73.8 per cent of MCT's total debt of S$1.55 billion has been fixed by way of fixed rate debt or interest rate swaps. It has executed forward start interest rate swaps to bring total fixed debt to about 78 per cent.\n\nMCT will pay out the fiscal Q4 distribution on June 3, with the book closure date on May 5. The distribution reinvestment plan will discontinue after the Q4 distribution.\n\nUnits of MCT closed 1.7 per cent lower at S$1.465 on Tuesday before the earnings release.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While Powermat's charging technology is increasingly being used in phones, cars and Starbucks cafes, widespread adoption remains elusive.\n\nIt doesn't help that the Israeli firm is being roiled by management infighting, dividing the board and prompting CEO Thorsten Heins to offer his resignation.\n\nThe last thing Powermat needs right now is a distraction. Competition is intensifying with a rival technology called Qi, and Apple is said to be cooking up its own version. Consumers, having waited years to be freed from pesky charging cords, increasingly say they want someone - anyone - to provide a simple way they can wirelessly charge their phones, tablets and laptops.\n\nJim McGregor, the principal analyst at TIRIAS Research, says wireless charging won't become mainstream until a widely available service lets people power-up on the go. \"If you have to go around to multiple places, you don't want to carry a charging mat with you,\" he said. \"You want to charge where you are.\"\n\nMr McGregor says it's striking that wireless charging hasn't taken off despite the concept's appeal. Powermat's struggle to become ubiquitous is emblematic.\n\nSince its founding in Neve Ilan, a kibbutz-like cooperative outside Jerusalem, the company has tried one business model after another. First Powermat sold mats - hence its name - that charged devices placed on top of them. Since recognising that low-cost rivals were commoditising the business, Powermat has largely stopped making consumer hardware.\n\nThe company also licensed technology to automakers and inked partnerships with hotels and restaurant chains, including Starbucks, which has installed Powermat technology at hundreds of cafes. In the past few months, Powermat has tweaked its strategy again, moving to a service model. The company has developed a \"mobile engagement platform\" that it will sell to businesses - mostly restaurants, bars and hotels - so they can provide wireless charging to customers who've downloaded the Powermat app. As customers eat, drink or work, they'll receive coupons and ads via Powermat's cloud-based system.\n\nDavid Green, who researches wireless power for market intelligence firm IHS, said that while offering ads is a \"massive bonus\" for the provider, it also carries \"a risk of being off-putting\" to some consumers.

I think he should keep his thoughts to himself,\" Ms Taylor said.\n\nIn the Democratic race, front-runner Hillary Clinton looks set to expand her lead over US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Tuesday's contests. A strong showing by Clinton could turn up the pressure on Sanders to get out of the race or ease his criticism of her.\n\nThe former secretary of state has an almost insurmountable lead of 275 pledged delegates heading into Tuesday's contests, and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told reporters he did not think Sanders had a realistic path to winning the nomination.\n\nMr Reid said Mr Sanders had run a \"unique and powerful\" campaign and he refused to urge him to step aside.\n\nBut asked if he thought Mr Sanders had a path to the nomination, he said: \"No I do not.\" A senior strategist for Mr Sanders, Tad Devine, told the New York Times that Mr Sanders would \"reassess\" any possible adjustments to his campaign after Tuesday, although he said the candidate would stay in the race.\n\n'NOT GETTING OUT'\n\n\"Since Iowa, we've been asked at every election: 'Are you getting out now?' The answer is no,\" Sanders' wife, Jane, told MSNBC.\n\nMr Sanders, who has attacked Mrs Clinton from the left with pledges to do more than she would to address social inequality, insisted he stood a good chance to win some of the states. \"I think we've got a path to victory and we're going to fight this until the last vote is cast,\" Mr Sanders said on CNN.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr Trump expressed sympathy for Mr Sanders, saying he had been \"treated terribly\" in the Democratic race.\n\nMrs Clinton has added to her lead over Mr Sanders with strong support from superdelegates free to back any candidate.\n\nMr Trump, who would benefit if he faced two opponents in November instead of one, suggested Mr Sanders \"should show them, and run as an independent!\" Mr Sanders has said he would not make an independent run for the White House.\n\nWhile railing against the Republican system, Mr Trump announced on April 7 he was reorganising his campaign to focus on delegate and convention strategy, hiring advisers with convention experience.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, candidates hope to get as many die-hard supporters as possible elected as delegates, both to build support on the first ballot and to bolster their position if no one gets to 1,237 delegates outright and the Cleveland convention becomes a protracted fight for the nomination.\n\nIt is unclear if Trump's campaign revved up its efforts in time to make a difference in Pennsylvania's delegate race.\n\nUS Representative Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania, a Trump surrogate, said the campaign had taken some steps, including printing cards naming its preferred candidates for delegates so that voters going to the polls would know who backs Trump.\n\nBefore that, \"we were just scribbling names on a piece of paper for them,\" Barletta said. \"I think the organization coming here to Pennsylvania was just in the nick of time.\" Mr Cruz's Pennsylvania chairman, Lowman Henry, said he had not noticed a ramp-up by Mr Trump there. \"All we've noticed is a bunch of whining about it,\" he said. \"Our response is: They whine, we win.\"\n\nMr Cruz has met with would-be delegates who have promised to support him if they are elected, as well as candidates who have not declared any allegiance, Mr Henry said. Mr Kasich has also met with prospective delegates.\n\nIt is difficult to predict which presidential candidate will get the most support from Pennsylvania. Many delegate candidates have said they will vote for whoever wins the state or their district, at least on the first ballot at the convention.\n\nIf those delegates hold to their informal promises, Mr Trump could win most of Pennsylvania's votes on the first round in Cleveland, said Charles Gerow, a conservative strategist also running to be a Pennsylvania delegate.\n\nBut if Mr Trump falls short of the votes needed to win on the first ballot in Cleveland, and delegates across the country begin switching sides, the efforts now being made to woo Pennsylvania delegates could pay off.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

The dollar, which weakened after the last Fed meeting in March, was relatively steady at US$1.1298 per euro.\n\nAnd the indication from CME fed fund futures prices was that markets do not really expect the next rate hike before September at the earliest.\n\nWhen the FOMC made its first rate increase in more than nine years in December, putting the short-term benchmark at a still ultra-low 0.25-0.50 per cent, the expectation was for another 0.25 percentage point rise each quarter over 2016.\n\nBut so far this year, noted economist Chris Low at FTN Financial, what is notable about the FOMC is \"the lack of urgency by Yellen and Co.\"\n\nAlthough one key determinant of policy, employment levels, has improved strongly each month, with the unemployment rate now at 4.9 per cent, the other main indicator, inflation, remains very weak.\n\nBut the Fed has also focused on another variable, the turbulence in global markets that has been spurred at least in part by its plans for tightening US monetary conditions.\n\nBacking up the idea that events like Brexit and Chinese market volatility are on the mind of the FOMC, a study of Fed policy statements under Ms Yellen and under her predecessor Ben Bernanke by Standard Chartered showed an equal focus on stability, though Mr Bernanke led the central bank through the financial crisis and Ms Yellen's time has been easier.\n\n\"The Fed is attaching just as much significance to financial stability as it did during the recession,\" the study concluded.\n\n\"We expect that the minutes of the Fed's April meeting will continue the trend of emphasising financial variables, such as the most recent decline in market volatility.\"\n\nJim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics predicted the tone of the policy statement - Ms Yellen will not add any interpretation with a press conference - will be \"a bit more positive than in the March statement, consistent with another tightening move in June if data and market developments are supportive.\" \"That said, we don't expect any direct hint about potential tightening by then,\" he added.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

Parts of the area will now be turned over to residential housing, hotels and commercial establishments.\n\nA document outlining Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 reform plan, released on Tuesday, also said authorities would \"strive to salvage\" the industrial cities, which were designed to diversify the economy beyond oil and create jobs.\n\nIt said the financial district had been started \"without consideration of its economic feasibility\" and that the project had failed to convince the financial community to invest.\n\n\"Without any dramatic shift in direction, renting the 3 million square metres of built-up areas at reasonable prices, or even achieving decent occupancy rates, will be very challenging,\" the document said.\n\nThe government will therefore aim to transform the district into a special business zone with competitive regulations, visa exemptions for foreigners working there, and direct connections to Riyadh's international airport, it said.\n\n\"We will also seek to repurpose some of the built-up areas and change the real estate mix, increasing the allocation for residential accommodation, services and hospitality areas.\"\n\nThe financial district will house the headquarters of the government's Public Investment Fund, which Prince Mohammed plans to build up in the reform drive to hold 7 trillion riyals (S$2.57 trillion) of assets compared to 600 billion riyals at present.\n\nThe reform document also acknowledged difficulties in efforts to create the six \"economic cities\".\n\nThe most prominent of these is King Abdullah Economic City on the Red Sea coast near Jeddah, which is being developed by Emaar the Economic City, a publicly listed firm.\n\n\"Work has halted in several cities, and others face challenges that threaten their viability,\" the document said.\n\n\"We have worked in cooperation with Aramco to restructure Jizan Economic City,\" it said, referring to state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\n\n\"We will strive to salvage other economic cities, especially those with comparative advantages.

The Business Times reported in December that four to five proposals had been made to the firm's receivers Borrelli Walsh.\n\nMarket analysts told BT that Borrelli Walsh had started talks with BP on a one-year tolling arrangement, and was hoping to start up the plant in April or May.\n\nUnder the arrangement, BP would provide feedstock to JAC and take up all of its output, thus freeing JAC from market risks.

The latter includes paraxylene, better known as PX, which goes into making polyester.\n\nStarting up in the second quarter would have allowed JAC's products to enter the market at a time when prices for PX are usually firm, and when margins for PX producers have been good, according to analysts.\n\nBT reported last year that 2016 would represent a window of opportunity for JAC to start up in a more profitable climate.\n\nA source close to the talks said both the receivers and BP had been pushing for the plant to start up soon. But the fire that broke out in the plant has put paid to these efforts - for now.\n\nOne of JAC's oil tanks caught fire last Wednesday afternoon. The intense blaze, which resulted in the tank collapsing, took about 150 firefighters five hours to extinguish.\n\nThe tank, which measures about 40m in diameter and 20m in height, contained light crude oil, or condensate, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). According to Borrelli Walsh, the condensate in the tank was from 2014 when the plant was first commissioned.\n\nA SCDF spokesman said the tank, which has a capacity of 2.5 million litres, was about 10 per cent full. The value of the oil is below US$75,000, said Anu Agarwal, vice-president of chemicals at market data provider Argus Media.\n\nAll activity at the plant has now been halted while the SCDF and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) conduct investigations into the cause of the fire, said a Borrelli Walsh spokesperson.\n\nAn MOM spokesperson said that a stop-work order has been issued to stop tank storage operations while investigations are ongoing, to ensure that control measures are in place to prevent a recurrence.\n\nAsked how much damage the fire has caused to the company, the Borelli Walsh spokesperson replied: \"That's what we are assessing now. A lot depends on SCDF's and MOM's decisions as well.\"\n\nHow much the fire would affect the proposed arrangement with BP is uncertain for now. \"Where we proceed from here really depends on what happens to the plant,\" she added. It is unclear if the talks over the tolling arrangement with BP will continue. BP declined to comment.\n\nJAC had started operations in August 2014 - three years later than the originally planned date of 2011 due to difficulty obtaining funding during the financial crisis - just as the market for PX turned sour.\n\nIt stopped operations in December that year to \"recalibrate\" its production process, but subsequently ran out of working capital.\n\nBefore it went into receivership, JAC's largest shareholders were South Korean refiner SK Energy (30 per cent) and Chinese polyester maker Jiangsu Sanfangxiang Industrial Group (25 per cent).\n\nOther significant owners include entrepreneur Vijay Goradia of Houston-based chemicals firm Vinmar Group (10.5 per cent), Swiss trader Glencore (10 per cent) and Indonesia's Sridjaja family (9.5 per cent).\n\nThai KK Industry, EDB Investments and Indian multinational conglomerate Essar Group rounded up the rest of the equity interest.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In doing so, it will not develop policies that are \"non-starters\", but instead design policies that are sound, well-supported and can be properly implemented, he said.\n\nIn his reminder to all civil servants to remain neutral when it came to politics, he said they should not misuse state resources or powers for partisan political purposes.\n\nThe prime minister said: \"Neither should they shy away from carrying out their duties without fear or favour when a matter could be politically controversial. For these reasons, key officers in the service are not allowed to be members of political parties.\"\n\nHe admitted that there would always be a \"fine balance\" between the civil service being neutral and non-political, and being politically sensitive and responsive.\n\n\"This is inherent in the role of the civil service - to work with and for political leaders in a political environment, and yet maintain a certain detachment from politics. It is a fine balance which has always been required, and which we must continue to maintain,\" he added.\n\nMr Lee also explained that the role of the civil service is very different from that of Cabinet ministers, whose scope includes looking after the politics in Singapore, and mastering their ministry and the policies that they are responsible for.\n\n\"(A minister) is not a non-executive chairman, presiding passively over an organisation that runs fine without him, while he busies himself with political affairs.\n\n\"He has to be hands-on, articulate a clear strategy for his ministry to achieve the needs and meet the aspirations of the people, and make sure his permanent secretary does a good job in implementing policy and operating the ministry.\"\n\nMinisters also have to provide political guidance to civil servants to deliver results, as well as shield them from political interference and ensure they do not get involved in political activities.\n\nWhile the ruling People's Action Party is still in a strong position, Mr Lee noted that the opposition has more fertile ground to till and is constantly active on the ground. Elections are fiercely contested and it is uncertain who will form the government on Nomination Day.\n\n\"The political leadership and the civil service have to work hand-in-hand in this new environment, with each understanding its respective role,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee warned that if the politics in Singapore are not right, a good civil service would itself be in jeopardy, even with safeguards such as the Public Service Commission and the Elected Presidency in place.\n\n\"For the system to provide stable, consistently good outcomes over the long term, politics and policy have to fit closely together. If either one goes wrong, the system may well malfunction,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Singapore is in a \"sweet spot\" because the country's politics and policies have worked together in a constructive fashion over the years. This formula has delivered results, not just for a single election term but for the long haul, said Mr Lee.\n\nThis is a unique position to be in and it is \"highly abnormal\" by international standards, and Singapore must never lose this \"precious competitive advantage\" if it wants to stay special in the world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The total value of those transactions was about US$3.2 million.\n\nOn Tuesday, it said its auditors, Ernst & Young (EY), informed it on April 21 that EY had made a report to ACRA on issues it found while auditing Trek 2000's financial statements for the year ended Dec 31, 2015.\n\nTrek 2000 was \"not privy\" to the report and the report \"was not made available\" to it, it said.\n\nBut it added that EY told it that the report was \"accompanied by correspondence\" between EY and Trek 2000 that had been about the documentation deficiencies, further audit works in view of the deficiencies and an ongoing interested-party transaction (IPT) inquiry.\n\nEY had found discrepancies in: the identity of a customer in a transaction between Trek 2000's sales system and its books; delivery orders acknowledged by the customer and the airway bill relating to the shipment of the goods; and the identity of the payer as stated on certain bank transfer notices showing payments of about US$2.65 million made by the customer to the group.\n\nTrek 2000 said on Tuesday that \"pending the release of such announcements, there is uncertainty as to the implications arising from the matters raised by the auditors in the correspondence\", and it would convert its trading halt to a suspension.\n\nIt added that it would cooperate with the auditors and \"provide all reasonable assistance required to complete the IPT inquiry\", which is being carried out by TSMP Law Corp and scheduled to be completed around the end of May this year.\n\nThe auditors' report comes after two independent directors resigned from Trek 2000's board in late March. One, Francis Heng, resigned after bringing forward a \"pre-planned board retirement\" to facilitate personal work commitments and another, Ng Chong Khim, resigned due to personal reasons.\n\nThe company's shares last closed 0.2 Singapore cent down at S$0.186 on April 21.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

DeClout is seeking the approval of its shareholders to list its subsidiary Procurri and in the process reduce its effective stake from 69 per cent to an assumed 40 per cent. Based on the assumptions in the circular to shareholders, we estimate that DeClout may enjoy a windfall of at least S$48.6m - an impressive sum equivalent to 42 per cent of DeClout's current market capitalisation!\n\nOur review of comparable companies suggests that Procurri may be worth between S$141m and S$300m, with a similar sized company in France being sold at S$208m valuation in July 2015. Hence, the assumption of Procurri being listed at a market capitalisation of at least S$150m is reasonable.\n\nHowever, we caution that DeClout showed signs of slowing growth in 2H 2015. In our forecasts, we assume that DeClout will continue to invest in new businesses and we have been prudent to project an operating net loss in 2016, offset by the substantially larger one-off gain of S$48.6m.\n\nRaffles Medical Group | Sell\n\nTarget price: S$4.23\n\nApril 26 close: S$4.58\n\nCIMB, April 25\n\nPropelled by a full quarter's contribution from International SOS (ISOS), 1Q16 revenue rose a strong 23 per cent yoy to S$116.9m.

Magnus shares closed at 0.3 Singapore cent on Tuesday.\n\nMr Lee bought his shares from Value Capital Asset Management, a fund that holds Magnus-issued convertible bonds that may be converted into Magnus stock at a 10 per cent discount to recent prices. Those bonds are part of a three-tranche deal between Premier Equity Fund and Magnus. Value Capital Asset Management is the investment manager for Premier Equity Fund.\n\nThe emergence of Mr Lee, a Malaysian investor and politician, is very timely, given that Magnus's shareholders will meet at an extraordinary general meeting on Friday after a group of disgruntled minority shareholders sought a vote to remove the current directors. Mr Lee's newly acquired shares make him the single largest shareholder of Magnus.\n\nMagnus Energy chief executive Luke Ho said he has had contact with Mr Lee.\n\n\"He has expressed his confidence and faith in the current board and management,\" Mr Ho told The Business Times.\n\nLawyer Lim Chee San, who is one of the nominees proposed by the requisitioning shareholders to replace the current board, said the requisitioning shareholders are not hopeful of victory.\n\n\"Lee Chin Cheh is not associated with the requisitioning shareholders, as far as we know,\" Mr Lim said. \"Hence, we are not hopeful of succeeding at this Friday's EGM.\"\n\nThe 11 requisitioning shareholders - who held about 11.16 per cent of Magnus shares before the latest dilution by Value Capital's conversion of bonds into stock - are seeking to remove all four Magnus directors because of unhappiness with the \"relentless issuance of convertible notes\".\n\nIn the place of the current directors, the requisitioning shareholders wish to appoint Mr Lim, accountant Paul Go, and investor and businessman Steven Liu Yongqiang to the board.\n\nMr Lim said the proposed directors have yet to form a firm plan for the company without better access to information about the business.\n\n\"Although it is very likely that, if we do form the board, we will not activate the third tranche of the S$35 million convertible notes and may even try to negotiate cancellation of the unsubscribed portion of the second tranche of convertible notes. Also, if we do form the board, we will not waste any time in formulating a good plan for the company.\"\n\nMr Ho said the convertible bonds are essential.\n\n\"The board and management are seeking to grow the group by expanding on its existing business and to develop new business segments,\" he said. \"This requires funding, both for capital investments and working capital. Funds from the convertible bonds have been used to fund these investments and working capital, and we can increase our profitability and returns only if we invest sufficiently in these businesses.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The chain has grown to have over 3,000 outlets across the world, with around 2,000 in the UK.\n\n\"We are all very clear that Whitbread has been a great owner of Costa and given that track record and our future plans, there's no compelling reason to change Costa's ownership structure at this time,\" Ms Brittain said on a conference call.\n\nWhitbread said total sales at Premier Inn rose 12.9 per cent in the 53 weeks to March 3, with group sales rising 12 per cent. Total Costa Coffee sales grew 15.9 per cent with a 2.9 per cent increase in UK like-for-like sales.\n\nThe CEO believes that the UK coffee drinking market hasn't reached its peak and that there's still more momentum left. \"From a structural perspective, there is more (coffee) consumption to do,\" Ms Brittain added.\n\nUK is fast becoming a nation of coffee connoisseurs. Daily visits to coffee shops have increased and 16 per cent of coffee shop visitors frequented a coffee shop at least once a day in 2015 compared with 14 per cent a year earlier, according to consultancy Allegra Strategies.

That is the message from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, who overwhelmingly advise against adding to investments in developers such as Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliarios SA, Iguatemi Empresa de Shopping Centers SA and BR Malls Participacoes SA.\n\nMall operators have held up better than many of the retailers that fill their centres, and that resilience has helped their stocks rally 54 per cent this year, according to a weighted average of seven mall owners. That is almost three times the return for the benchmark Ibovespa.\n\nBut as much as Brazilians love to shop, the worst recession in more than a century - not to mention the presidential impeachment crisis - will probably undermine prospects for a turnaround in mall occupancy. An analysis by Credit Suisse Group AG published last month showed that one-third of major mall retailers were facing serious financial distress, led by apparel companies, which take up 63 per cent of mall floor space. The real estate companies that count on them for rental income are hardly immune.\n\nCredit Suisse analysts including Nicole Hirakawa and Luis Stacchini said that they no longer see malls as a wise bet on Brazil and that net income will probably fall this year across much of the sector for a second year. \"Vacancy and delinquency risks are higher, and the key factor will be the ability to replace retailers reducing store fleet and the ones that will go bust,\" they said.\n\nA total of 12,000 mall stores stand empty, according to a recent Ibope Inteligencia study. That is about 15 per cent of the total square footage. If grouped together, the space would equal that of 58 phantom malls of 323,000 sq ft (30,000 sq m) each.\n\nVacancy levels are higher in malls that opened in the past three years, the Ibope study shows. In newer centres, as much as 45 per cent of stores are empty, while fewer than 10 per cent are vacant in malls opened before 2012, prior to the economic slowdown and eventual collapse.\n\nLike new condominiums and suburban housing projects, the proliferation of malls was among the most visible signs of Brazil's economic boom in the previous decade, which helped shepherd some 40 million people out of poverty and into the middle class. In the go-go years, Brazilians not only had money but were willing to spend it. A McKinsey & Co report showed that 46 per cent of Brazilians considered shopping among the best ways to spend time with their families.\n\nIn the heart of Vila Olimpia, a bustling commercial district in Sao Paulo, at least 30 boarded-up retail spaces stand out in the ShoppingVilaOlimpia mall. The complex, which opened in 2009, had a 94 per cent occupancy rate in December, compared with an average rate of 98 per cent among all the malls in the portfolio of its operator, Multiplan. Multiplan said that it is always changing the retailers in ShoppingVilaOlimpia to meet the needs of consumers. Some of the available retail space is under negotiation for rent and some is about to be leased, according to the company.\n\n\"The flow of people into the ShoppingVilaOlimpia mall grew 21 per cent per year on average since 2010, and sales almost doubled in the same period,\" the company said.\n\nIt is not all bad news for malls, of course. A notable exception is Catarina, an 18-month-old outlet centre about an hour's drive from downtown Sao Paulo. On a recent sunny Saturday afternoon, Catarina was packed, with most visitors holding multiple shopping bags. The mall caters to Sao Paulo consumers on weekend trips to the countryside as well as middle-class shoppers from nearby towns. It features a wide range of clothing stores, from Hering - a Brazilian version of Gap Inc's Old Navy - to luxury retailers such as Tory Burch and Armani.\n\nCatarina's sales grew 69 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period last year, said JHSF Participacoes SA, which owns the mall.\n\nAmong other retail developers, Iguatemi and BR Malls still have growth potential, according to Marcelo Motta, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co in Sao Paulo. He has an \"overweight\" rating for both, and \"neutral\" recommendations for BR Properties and Multiplan.\n\nIguatemi and BR Malls have scale, which gives them bargaining power with store owners to keep their malls full. Iguatemi's centres cater to wealthier shoppers, who are less affected by the economic crisis, and to the Sao Paulo market, which has been less hit than Rio de Janeiro, Mr Motta said. As for BR Malls, he expects Brazil's benchmark interest rate to drop this year, which would benefit the company's debt payments. He also sees malls as an entertainment alternative even during crises.\n\nBrazil's middle and upper classes see malls as a safe haven in developing cities with high crime rates and poor options of public spaces, another reason that bulls think malls are a good bet.\n\n\"We are very well positioned to endure this moment of crisis,\" Iguatemi chief financial officer Cristina Betts said. \"It is much nicer for the consumer to go to a beautiful, well-located mall, and the retailer wants to be in a place with high traffic.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

But the analysts observed that during the first quarter as a whole, there were many instances of a distinct mismatch between sales growth and so-called starts at the provincial level.\n\nIn particular, some bulk commodity-producing locales like Xinjiang saw starts outstrip sales by a massive margin. This development lends support to a potentially worrisome dynamic: faced with a slowdown in growth, Chinese policymakers are backsliding on their quest for rebalancing of economic activity towards domestic demand.\n\n\"This regional discrepancy between new starts and sales is somewhat counter-intuitive, and more importantly, it probably runs against Beijing's target of property destocking,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"The central and western provinces (particularly the resource-rich ones) have been hit hard by the slowdown of the whole economy; as a result, existing property stock may be harder to be absorbed in these provinces; another wave of new starts clearly doesn't help to resolve the issue of existing housing inventory.\"\n\nHowever, Roper & Co point to another reason for the puzzling composition of China's housing strength. The looming value-added tax reform, which begins to go into effect on May 1, may see some of the revenue generated from housing starts siphoned away by the central government. The analysts speculate that local governments may have been leaning on developers to break ground ahead of this policy change in order to prevent further erosion of their tax bases.\n\n\"Beijing will probably work out a transition plan to ensure local interests don't get hurt too much, but the uncertainties of the final implementation may still have compelled some local governments to take measures to protect their tax income,\" the team noted.\n\n\"One possibility is that they may have pushed local property developers to advance project starts, and the implication is that actual construction activities may turn out to be somewhat less strong than the National Bureau of Statistics data suggest.\"\n\nThe upshot, according to the analysts, is that the demand for commodities implied by this spike in starts - particularly for steel - may be overstated in the near term if many of these starts turn out to be phantom activity that was advanced at the behest of local authorities.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/germanys-glashuette-beating-switzerland", "site_title": "Germany's Glashuette is beating Switzerland", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGermany's Glashuette is beating Switzerland\n\nIts watchmaking industry produced more than 32,000 watches last year, according to analyst estimates\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Apr 26, 2016 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nGermany\n\nFollow\n\nZurich\n\nTHE German village of Glashuette doesn't look like much: just a handful of streets stretching up and down a narrow valley from a bare station platform, where trains depart once an hour for the 45-minute trip to Dresden. Scratch a bit deeper, though, and you'll find that the town of 7,000 people is home to the greatest concentration of world-class watchmakers outside of Switzerland - with a business that's growing even as Swiss producers retrench.\n\nGlashuette produced more than 32,000 watches last year, with a total value of at least 500 million euros (S$763.4 million), according to analyst estimates. These aren't Swatches: The town's 10 watchmakers tend towards the high end, and the priciest local producer, A Lange & Soehne, has built a reputation that rivals those of giants such as Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet. Some of its watches top 1.9 million euros, and its average price is roughly 50,000 euros.\n\n\"Our customers like that not everyone knows what they have around their wrist,\" says Wilhelm Schmid, chief executive officer of A Lange & Soehne. \"We're a very well-kept secret, almost like stealth wealth.\"\n\nThe German industry, though far smaller than Switzerland's, is less dependent on sales to China, where the watch business has been hammered by an anti-corruption drive. And with most expenses in euros, producers have been able to keep costs in check, unlike Swiss rivals that have to deal with the surging franc. While Switzerland's Richemont in February said that it may cut as many as 350 jobs in Switzerland, the two biggest watchmakers in Glashuette say they're hiring. German watch exports last year jumped 14 per cent even as Switzerland's fell 3.3 per cent, government data shows.\n\nDespite the differing fortunes, the market for luxury watches is global, and the Germans may soon face the problems that have hit the Swiss, cautions Rene Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich. The slump in tourism to Europe after the November terrorist attacks in Paris and the bombings in Brussels last month will likely eat into sales, Mr Weber says, and \"the luxury watchmakers in Glashuette will also feel the downturn in Asia\". Glashuette owes much of its prosperity to the Swiss. Lange has sent employees to the Swiss town of Schaffhausen, home to sister brand IWC, for training. And some Glashuette producers import components such as watch hands and dials from Swiss suppliers. In 2000, Richemont bought Lange, and Swatch Group acquired Glashuette Original and Union Glashuette.\n\nGlashuette's success is all the more notable given that the town's industry has almost perished more than once. Lange was the town's first watchmaker, founded in 1845 by Ferdinand Adolf Lange, a Dresden native who studied the trade in Switzerland and Paris. He trained Glashuette youths to make pocket watches, and as they gained experience some branched out on their own. By the turn of the century, Glashuette counted as many as 20 companies that manufactured watches, marine chronometers and grandfather clocks.\n\nAfter World War II, the town's half-dozen remaining watch companies were expropriated by East Germany's communist government and merged into a state-owned kombinat, which continued to manufacture mechanical watches, marine chronometers and, from the 1980s, inexpensive quartz watches. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the kombinat had some 2,500 workers. But the company struggled with the introduction of the Deutschmark after unification with West Germany, and by 1994 employment in the town's watch industry had plunged to just 72 people.\n\n\"Unlike Switzerland, which has been allowed to work in peace, we've had wars, economic crises, bankruptcies,\" says Yann Gamard, president of Glashuette Original. \"Everything was taken away from us by the Soviets after World War II. But the people remained, and so did their know-how.\"\n\nTo avoid being sent to work in a uranium mine - a virtual death sentence at the time - Mr Lange's great-grandson Walter in 1948 fled Glashuette for the West, where he founded a company that distributed Swiss watches. The Lange brand, though, was mothballed for four decades. In 1990, Walter Lange returned to his ancestral home with Guenter Bluemlein, chairman of Swiss watchmakers IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre, and together they revived the Lange & Soehne name.\n\nJust like in the mid-19th century, a host of other watchmakers have sprung up around the company. Glashuette Original and Nomos Glashuette emerged in 1994, the year the resurrected Lange released its first wristwatches. In 2000, German watchmaker Bruno Soehnle opened a factory in Glashuette to produce mid-range timepieces. And in 2008, a veteran of Lange relaunched the 19th-century Moritz Grossmann brand, which today produces about 200 watches a year that cost as much as 168,000 euros.\n\nThe sector employs almost 2,000 people, and Glashuette looks something like a high-end watch show. At one end of town the five-storey building Lange completed last year spans the road. Across the train tracks, Moritz Grossman's 40 employees work in a white concrete building that resembles an ocean liner. Farther up the steep hill overlooking the valley, jeweller Wempe makes high-end timepieces in a converted 1910 observatory. Small watch retailers dot the main street, a watch museum dominates the central square, and the town's coat of arms depicts a clock dial.\n\nThe factories themselves are as clean as hospitals and as quiet as libraries. At Lange's pristine facility, women in white lab coats hunch over desks, polishing pieces just a few millimetres long to a range of finishes. A few doors down, engravers peer into microscopes to etch floral designs on pieces of metal the size of a baby's fingernail. In rooms sealed to ward off dust, the company's dozens of watchmakers use tweezer- like tools to create timepieces out of hundreds of tiny components. A century ago, \"Glashuette was known as Germany's watch mecca,\" said Christine Hutter, CEO of Moritz Grossmann. \"And today it has become that again.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/5fc8720577e94166c7c6f3c93f1f080095de19016edc6ab63dcbf86382cf5e25?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "(Above) Zeitwerk Striking Time being assembled at the A Lange & Soehne factory."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7ffedf99cb63e2e8d69489e5188e6676d15120d7f4789afe66a500e49ff3776f?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "\"We're a very well-kept secret, almost like stealth wealth,\" said Mr Schmid."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/d748df9a5e2c0382aadea3d9e160611da2b6f30e7446399ad06aa1b621e911c4?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "(Above) Richard Lange Tourbillion \"Pour le Merite\"."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/b030b86d18f10b281b37e0685a9023d8ddab00aa5f61371283039eb16a1046ec?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "(Above) Datograph Up/Down Flyback."}]}

He was candid in saying these are \"the least thorough projections I have done in my life\", speaking about the experimentation DBS is making in this form of banking, which is paperless and branchless. \"Our agenda is to take it to other markets.\"\n\nThis is mainly targeted at white-collar customers. The bank said that authentication is backed by the Aadhaar card, a biometrics-enabled ID issued to over one billion Indians in the world's largest biometric identification programme. Account opening is done through a network of outlets run by DBS's partners, including as a start, over 500 cafes in places such as Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai.\n\nCustomer service will be backed by artificial-intelligence technology, and transactions are secured through tokenisation.\n\nDBS wants to tap into this rapidly growing economy, with a booming middle class, and one with an existing digital infrastructure, said Mr Gupta. DBS also has no legacy footprint in India, and has had, until now, no retail strategy for India, he said. Its focus has been on corporate banking: DBS is waiting on regulatory approval for subsidiarisation of its India business. The approval allows it to open 50-70 branches to grow its corporate book.\n\nThe efficiencies and lower costs of mobile banking will enable the bank to pass on benefits to customers, Mr Gupta said. Account holders earn 7 per cent interest from the first rupee, one of the highest in the market. Customers also have no minimum balance requirements, and will be able to make unlimited free cash withdrawals at over 200,000 ATMs nationwide.\n\n\"Pricing is not the principal agenda,\" Mr Gupta said, noting that the strategy for holding on to its customers is to tie them in with hassle-free functions to make banking seamless.\n\nSpeaking earlier at the launch event in India, Mr Gupta - decked out in a suit but with a bright t-shirt underneath - noted that banks can easily go digital, arguing that fintechs do not have the monopoly or prerogative on technology. In a move that can be seen as self-deprecating, DBS created a mobile banking mascot - a jaunty dinosaur named Digor.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Slumping demand for automobiles, computers and electrical goods suggests that the downturn in the factory sector was far from over.\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday that orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft, meant to last three years or more - increased 0.8 per cent last month after declining 3.1 per cent in February.\n\nNon-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business-spending plans, were unchanged after a downwardly revised 2.7 per cent decrease in the prior month. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have decreased 2.5 per cent in February.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast durable-goods orders advancing 1.8 per cent last month, and orders for manufactured capital goods increasing 0.8 per cent.\n\nThe report came as Federal Reserve officials are meeting for a two-day policy meeting. The US central bank is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged on Wednesday. It hiked interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nWhile most manufacturing surveys have painted a fairly upbeat picture of the sector in recent months as a US dollar rally fizzled, so-called hard data such as industrial production and factory orders have remained depressed.\n\nManufacturing, which accounts for 12 per cent of the US economy, is struggling with the lingering effects of the dollar's past surge and sluggish overseas demand.\n\nSo far this year, the US dollar is down 2.7 per cent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners. It gained 20 per cent between June 2014 and December 2015.\n\nFactories also have been hurt by big spending cuts on capital projects by oilfield-service firms such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, as well as efforts by businesses to sell a stockpile of unwanted inventory.\n\nThe rise in durable-goods orders last month was led by a 65.7 per cent jump in defence aircraft orders, which lifted bookings for transportation equipment 2.9 per cent.\n\nOrders for civilian aircraft fell 5.7 per cent despite Boeing reporting on its website that it had received orders for 69 aircraft last month, up from two in February. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 3 per cent. Demand for automobiles has softened in recent months after sales hit a record high in 2015.\n\nThere were increases in orders for primary metals and machinery. Orders for computers and electronic products fell as did those for electrical equipment, appliances and components. Despite manufactured capital goods orders being flat last month, shipments of core capital goods - used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report - rose 0.3 per cent after slumping 1.8 per cent in February.

The measure, known as negative gearing, has helped stoke a surge in property prices. The flip side: rising unaffordability - which the opposition Labor Party is trying to capitalise on with a pledge to curb the tax break.\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose popularity is sliding, has spied an opportunity. He is betting that Australians - among the most privately indebted people in the world - will recoil from any threat to their home's value. The leader, who owns a portfolio of investment properties himself, has berated Labor's policy as a \"reckless\" threat to most families' biggest asset, and one that could savage the entire housing market.\n\n\"Housing is one of the main areas where the two political parties differ significantly,\" said Callam Pickering, who runs consultancy CP Economics and previously worked as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia. \"It almost feels like a bit of a referendum on the housing market - depending on how you feel might affect the way you vote.\"\n\nAbout 1.2 million Australian real estate investors use negative gearing, which allows them to lower their tax bill by deducting the costs of owning a rental property, including mortgage interest payments, from their taxable income.\n\nLabor wants to ban the practice for existing homes, which accounted for 93 per cent of the A$155 billion (S$162.4 billion) of property investment last year. It argues the change would spur new home construction and allow more first-home buyers to enter the market. The party also plans to curb a discount on capital gains tax paid when a property is sold.\n\nMore than two months after the opposition released its policy, the government made its stance official on Sunday. Mr Turnbull held a media briefing outside the home of a young couple who had bought an investment property to fund the purchase of a home for their child. He said that Labor's proposal will deliver to Australian home owners a \"reckless trifecta\" of lower home values, higher rents and less investment.\n\nThe Grattan Institute, an economic think-tank, said in a report this week that scrapping negative gearing and a reduction in the capital gains discount would reduce home prices by only as much as 2 per cent.\n\n\"Distortions in our current tax system encourage households to over-invest in residential property, so there is a case for reform,\" said Paul Bloxham, chief Australia economist at HSBC Holdings plc in Sydney. \"But there's really no escaping that housing is a critical part of Australia's economy and has to be dealt with very carefully.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Both have blamed the free trade policies pursued by Republican and Democratic presidents for what they describe as the devastation of the American workforce and have pledged to pursue trade restrictions to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.\n\nWhile in the past bashing free trade was regarded as nothing more than election campaign rhetoric, this time it seems that scapegoating it for lost jobs and low working-class wages is gaining wider support among voters who buy into the campaign promises to restore economic prosperity by punishing trade partners.\n\nSo it's not surprising that investors and business executives around the world are getting anxious over the prospect of a staunch protectionist figure like Mr Trump - who proposed slapping 45 per cent tariffs on all imports from China and 35 per cent on many goods from Mexico - becoming the next president.\n\nIn fact, the British magazine The Economist has warned that a Trump presidency and the prospect for costly trade wars between the US and emerging economies posed a top-10 risk event that could disrupt the world economy, by igniting turmoil in the financial markets that could lead to a global recession.\n\nThere has been a serious debate between economists over what extent free trade agreements and the liberalisation of global trade - as opposed to, say, automation - are responsible for the loss of jobs among blue-collar workers in the industrialised economies. And no one is suggesting that the issue shouldn't be debated between American presidential candidates.\n\nBut very few economists would seriously argue that launching trade wars against China or Mexico would help create new manufacturing jobs and help grow the US economy. To the contrary: The consensus is that imposing large tariffs on imports from these and other emerging economies would drive them into recession and would also hurt the American economy after US trading partners retaliate with tariffs of their own. Indeed, based on a study by Moody's Analytics, published recently in The Washington Post, a trade war between the US and China and Mexico would result in a 4.6 per cent contraction of the America economy and a loss of seven million jobs (including in the auto industry) with the unemployment rate rising to 9.5 per cent and the deficit growing by 60 per cent by 2019.\n\nIn general, such trade wars would disrupt America manufacturers that depend on global supply chains, make basic consumer goods more expensive and send shockwaves through the financial markets. \"I don't mind trade wars when we're losing so much now,\" explained Mr Trump during a CNN debate in February. The problem is that when fighting trade wars Americans are bound to lose much more. China and Mexico are \"killing us\", he suggested. Imagine the carnage left after waging trade wars with them.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The late star, who bought the villa in 1998 as a wedding gift for his then wife, the dancer Mayte Garcia, sold it in 2006.\n\n\"The house is very glam, very luxurious, but also very flashy; it's a bit outdated in that sense - the location isn't perfect either,\" said Olivia Valere, a nightclub owner who knew Prince when he vacationed in Marbella in the late 1990s and who dined at the house of the star. Ms Valere, whose nightclub Prince would visit to play music, said: \"I don't think he was well advised on that deal - it's not for the jet set.\"\n\nThe failure to find a buyer may show a shift in the taste for luxury homes and comes even as the market for high-end real estate in Marbella, and Spain generally, is on the rebound as the country's economic fortunes improve and its sunny coasts retain their attraction as a playground for the world's wealthy. Buyers are gravitating towards more elegant homes in such exclusive areas of Marbella as Sierra Blanca or La Zagaleta, said Ms Valere.\n\nPrince's former villa lies just west of Marbella in the hills of El Paraiso - a wealthy residential area that enjoys views of the mountains and a golf course designed by Gary Player as well as the Mediterranean sea, according to the Engel & Volkers sales pitch.\n\nPrince, the artist behind hits including Sign o' the Times and Purple Rain, who died suddenly last week, wasn't the most recent owner of the house which, according to Engel & Volkers was the \"inspiring scenario for many of his beautiful songs\". \"The fact that it once belonged to Prince undoubtedly adds to the value of the house,\" Engel & Volkers said. \"The house is very special. It's a type of construction and decoration that is not to everyone's taste, but the owner is in no rush to sell and the price isn't negotiable.\"\n\nSpanish house prices have fallen an average of 41 per cent since the real estate market imploded in 2007, according to data from Tinsa, Spain's largest property appraiser. Average prices in Spain rose 0.8 per cent in March from the year ago period, with prices in coastal areas jumping 4.3 per cent, Tinsa data shows.\n\nHomes in the province of Malaga, where Marbella is situated, take about 9.1 months to sell compared with a national average of 10.5 months, according to Tinsa.\n\nNo expense was spared in building Prince's former home with its three upstairs bedroom suites with marble bathrooms set in 6,000 square metres of landscaped gardens bordered by cypress trees and a boundary wall for maximum privacy. Engel and Volkers began marketing the property for the current owners in 2014.\n\nThe reason why it's been on the market so long may have more to do with investors' tastes for more contemporary-style homes, said Dario Fernandez, a director at the Marbella-based real estate broker Prime Invest. \"I don't think the fact that Prince owned it once upon a time is going to give it any cachet or help sell,\" he said. \"The other problem is that it's not in a prime area.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

In Singapore, it was lower mainly due to higher claims in the non-participating fund, while the share from Malaysia was lower primarily because of a weaker Malaysian ringgit.\n\nThe uncertain financial markets also led to a non-operating loss from insurance business of S$42.6 million for the quarter, a reverse from the non-operating profit of S$41.1 million a year ago.\n\nKhor Hock Seng, group chief executive, said: \"The volatility in the global financial markets during the quarter impacted the valuation of our assets, resulting in a lower profit attributable to shareholders. Notwithstanding this, our investment portfolio remains sound and our capital position also remains strong.\"\n\nIn terms of sales, the year started strong in both Singapore and Malaysia, Mr Khor said, adding that this was due to efforts to harness synergies with the group's parent bank and bancassurance partner, OCBC Bank, as well as improved productivity of its sales force.\n\nTotal weighted new sales for Q1 rose 9 per cent from a year ago to S$222.9 million. Excluding the sales contribution from the group's investment in China, which ceased to be accounted for as an associate from December 2015, total weighted new sales for the quarter was 11 per cent higher.\n\nIn Singapore, this growth was fuelled by the bancassurance channel, while in Malaysia, regular premium products continued to drive both the conventional and takaful businesses.\n\nNew business embedded value (NBEV), a measure of long-term economic profitability, was comparable to the same period a year ago at S$84.7 million.

Mr Gross has filed a lawsuit asserting that he was wrongfully terminated, and he is seeking US$200 million - which he said he plans to donate to charity. And, as he is only too happy to point out, his new vehicle, the Janus Global Unconstrained Fund, is handily beating its counterpart at Pimco.\n\nIn a world where a portfolio manager's ability to outperform represents the truest measure of worth, these results have invigorated Mr Gross.\n\n\"I am fixated on proving that they were wrong,\" he said. \"It's like - no, you shouldn't have done that and the numbers will prove it.\" Pimco is no less fixated on him. This month, Pimco filed a legal response, saying Mr Gross' erratic and reckless behaviour left it no choice.\n\nThe turmoil was tied to the abrupt departure in 2014 of Mohamed El-Erian, who had been set to succeed Mr Gross.\n\nThe accounts of Mr Gross' conduct were described by people who have worked with him at the firm, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nFurious at the betrayal, Mr Gross wanted to dock Mr El-Erian's pay and provoke him into suing Pimco, which, he believed, would hurt his chances of getting another job, those people said. Pimco executives rejected the idea - as well as a demand that they lie to a newspaper reporter to present him in a better light, they said.\n\nEven with the punishing toll of that turmoil - outflows, layoffs and a battered reputation - firm leaders say they have no regrets.\n\nStill, while they have strived to assure concerned clients that Pimco is moving on, Mr Gross' ability to remain squarely in the public eye, via the legal fight and now a campaign to promote his superior performance, is driving them to distraction.\n\nMichael Reid, a spokesman, said, \"The entire 240-member portfolio management team competes in the financial markets every day with the goal of generating strong risk-managed returns on behalf of our clients.\"\n\nPatricia Glaser, Mr Gross' lawyer, said the assertions were untrue: \"Pimco seems to have a problem getting their story straight. It is now acknowledging they pushed Bill out, instead of their previous claim that Bill walked away from the company.\" That the dispute has become a mind game of sorts does not seem to bother Mr Gross.\n\nUnlike any other fund manager, Mr Gross, who majored in psychology at Duke University, puts himself on the couch for the world to see. In his investment letters, he has revealed such intimacies as the erotic pleasure of a good sneeze, his failure in college to get a girl into the back seat of his car and how sad he was when his cat died.\n\nConvention bores him: That is why he will stand on his head when the urge hits and wear a silk tie as a scarf, draped loosely around his neck.\n\nSo it is no revelation for him to own up to obsessive behaviour in terms of how his US$1.3 billion fund is faring against its Pimco counterpart.\n\nSince Mr Gross officially took control of his fund on Oct 6, 2014, he is up 1.8 per cent compared with Pimco Unconstrained, which is down 1.64 per cent, according to Morningstar.\n\nMaking it all the sweeter is the fact that Daniel J Ivascyn, one of the executives who led the effort to oust him and then took over as chief investment officer, is an executive of the fund. Mr Ivascyn, who manages the better-performing Pimco Income Fund, is not a primary manager on the vehicle.\n\n\"My whole evening is dependent on whether I beat them,\" Mr Gross said. \"You see, I have to prove it all over again. Every day.\" Despite this favourable run, money has not flooded in. One of his larger investors, George Soros, last year removed US$490 million from his oversight.\n\nOf the US$1.3 billion in the fund, about half is Mr Gross' own money.\n\n\"Money is holding out,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, a mutual fund specialist at Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence. \"I think there is legitimate market scepticism that he can do this on his own - without a Pimco team supporting him.\" Mr Gross contends the main reason that his bond fund has been winning the day is that Pimco has been making bold plays on emerging market bonds and inflation-linked securities, wagering that central bank activism will stimulate global growth. For some time now, he has been arguing that with rates at zero or negative, central banks have virtually no ability to spur growth.\n\n\"They are betting on reflation, while I am sceptical of it,\" he said.\n\nMr Gross, has, in effect, taken the opposite side of this wager by building a portfolio that pays off if there are no global market shocks, like interest rate increases or a large country going bust.\n\nOf course, such a strategy carries dangers. Mr Gross has made some big bets that Brazil and Mexico will not default by selling investors credit-default swaps, derivative instruments that would force him to disburse large sums if these countries go belly up.\n\nSuch derivative-fuelled bets on financial stability can backfire when markets go haywire. Last year, his Janus fund experienced several sharp drops in price, which preceded Mr Soros' decision to withdraw his funds.\n\n\"This is not a riskless strategy,\" Mr Gross acknowledged.

While the summit had a wide-ranging economic and political agenda, including Ukraine, Syria and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the future of Libya was centre stage, with a range of options discussed, including the potential for a Nato mission, to help stabilise the country.\n\nThis is because, at a time when the newly-established Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya wants to restore order in the country, there are growing US-UK-German-French-Italian and wider international concerns that ISIS may be establishing a stronghold there, especially in the coastal city of Sirte.\n\nUS intelligence estimates indicate the number of so-called ISIS fighters in Libya has probably doubled to between 4,000 to 6,000 in the last 12 to 18 months, with growing evidence that a significant number of these terrorists are travelling from Iraq and Syria where, because of offensive operations from the 66 member coalition forces, ISIS fighters are believed to be at the lowest level for some two years.\n\nThe G-5 meeting was convened, in large part, because around half a decade since the death of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, it is perceived that there is now a potential \"window of opportunity\" to try to bring greater order to the country following upheaval since then.\n\nIn the absence of the failure to plan for the aftermath of the Gaddafi regime, which Mr Obama has called the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency, the nation is currently controlled by rival militias, governments and parliaments and the G-5 leaders urgently want to shore up the GNA.\n\nMoreover, following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, the G-5 is particularly intent on eliminating the prospect of ISIS developing a base of operations in Libya to attack Europe. Mrs Merkel said on Monday that the leaders agreed to \"do whatever we can to strengthen\" the GNA, echoing the calls of others including UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon who flagged last week the possibility of sending UK troops to train forces under the command of the GNA, stressing that ISIS is a direct threat to \"Western Europe and we have every interest in securing the security of a stable Libya\".\n\nIn this context, Mr Obama re-asserted on Monday that a full range of tools will now be used to roll back ISIS in Libya, from financial, intelligence, military and logistical support, and it is reported that UK special forces are already operating in the country. While sending combat troops has apparently been ruled out, it is \"quite possible\" that the GNA will soon request air and naval support to combat ISIS, according to British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond.\n\nGAPS IN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING\n\nMr Obama also stressed at the Monday meeting that the situation in Libya underlines the need for better European counterterrorism strategies and intelligence-sharing to tackle ISIS, especially in the wake of the Brussels and Paris attacks. The US president perceives major gaps in intelligence-gathering and sharing within the continent about ISIS, including in relation to movement of its terrorists across borders, and stressed that this needs better resolution just as the United States has sought to do after the September 2001 attacks.\n\nThe G-5 also discussed restoration of oil production to shore up Libya's economy, and migration flows from the country too. On the oil front, as UN statistics underline, the country has long relied almost entirely on oil and gas extraction, which accounts for 95 per cent of export earnings and 99 per cent of government income.\n\nOil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and among the top 10 globally with production of some 1.65 million barrels per day in 2010 prior to Col Gaddafi's ousting. However, production today stands at around 360,000 barrels a day which reflects Libya's plunge into chaos since then, including ISIS attacks on oil infrastructure. Rejuvenating Libya's oil production is not just critical to restoring the fortunes of the economy, but also to the GNA's survival, and alleviating migration flows from the country.\n\nMuch attention has recently been put on the new migrant deal between the European Union (EU), Turkey and Greece which will see new irregular migrants crossing to Greece returned to Turkey, with Brussels footing the bill. In return, the EU will admit vetted Syrian refugees directly from Turkey - one for each Syrian asylum seeker Ankara took back from Greece.\n\nHowever, migration from Libya to Italy is a pressing issue too, driven by instability post-the Gaddafi regime's fall. A key reason for the G-5's urgency here is not just the numbers of migrants, but also the fact that the death rate in 2015 on this sea route, based on data from the International Organisation for Migration, was around one in 20, compared to approximately one in 1,000 between Greece and Turkey.\n\nHence the reason why a potential Nato mission in the Mediterranean was discussed by the G-5 leaders to supplement the existing EU force in the region that is operating to try to help manage migrant flows.\n\nNato is already operating in the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey patrolling for smugglers, and the White House said on Monday that it has urged the EU and Nato to \"draw on their experience in the Aegean to explore how they could work together to address in an orderly and humane way migrant flows in the central Mediterranean\".\n\nTaken overall, the G-5 is now likely to intensify efforts to shore up the GNA in Libya, and tackle the growing ISIS menace in the country. Underlying this is the strategic priority to prevent the terrorist network using Libya as a key terrorist base of operations to attack Europe, while also mitigating migration flows from the country to the continent.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

This is the only way, Mr Lim said on Tuesday.\n\nHe was speaking at an event organised by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and Marina Bay Sands (MBS). The event was a Learning Journey for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the cleaning sector.\n\nAs part of MOM's Lean Enterprise Development (LED) scheme announced last September, Learning Journey is a series of events which showcase how SMEs can become early adopters of change, more productive, able to innovate, and manpower-lean.\n\nThe LED scheme is being piloted for two years and has three key features. One of them is to align efforts towards helping SMEs become more manpower-lean, with emphasis on a stronger Singaporean core and better-quality workers.\n\nThe other is transitional manpower support for early success in which MOM will exercise some temporary manpower policy adjustment during the period of transition for SMEs.\n\nThe third component is closer coordination and wider outreach to SMEs. This is being done by a cross-agency LED taskforce, led by Spring Singapore and WDA, that is helping to build on current efforts of the various agencies and integrate their existing assistance schemes to help SMEs in a more coordinated manner.\n\nMr Lim noted that SMEs must become manpower-lean because they employ two-thirds of the Singapore workforce. If they do not become manpower-lean, Singapore cannot become workforce-lean; so the SME sector is critical to success. \"In the coming months, we will reach out to even more SMEs towards a manpower-lean economy,\" he said.\n\nProviding some statistics, the minister said that over the past five years, Singapore added more than 550,000 new workers to the workforce. Of these, 250,000 - or almost half - were locals.\n\nMr Lim noted, however, that over the next five years, Singapore would not be able to add another 250,000 local workers on account of an ageing population. The figure is more likely to be 100,000 workers, he said.\n\n\"This sharp drop in the increase of local manpower is due to an ageing workforce. Over the next five, 10 and 15 years, the number of workers will continue to go down . . . and the implication is a very major one.\"\n\nThe only solution is to become a manpower-lean economy where we can find ways to slow down workforce growth in terms of numbers and instead improve the quality of jobs, Mr Lim said. \"We enhance the quality of jobs, and not quantity, to drive the growth of the economy.\"\n\nHe added: \"We must move towards a one-plus-two-equals-three approach - in which we have one per cent growth in manpower and 2 per cent increase in productivity, which will give us 3 per cent growth in GDP (gross domestic product).\"\n\nMr Lim noted that the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), through the Enterprise & Innovation Hub, recently launched the Lean Transformation Innovation Centre (LTIC).\n\nWith the collaboration between SIT, WDA and Boston-based Lean Enterprise Institute (LEI), LTIC will be a focal point for SMEs to acquire relevant knowledge, provide manpower training and also co-develop technological solutions that will help them become more manpower-lean.\n\nMinister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck said the lean enterprise projects have been progressing well, and more than 600 SMEs have been approved to be lean enterprise development companies.\n\n\"All their solutions are trending towards a more productive workforce, scaling down the number of people they need and also extracting the maximum value from each individual in their company,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nOn its part, the government is increasing the number of consultants and also multipliers that would help transition a company into a lean company. \"This meets the objective of industry transformation that was mentioned in the Budget,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nHe added that a lot of innovation is happening and that there is a manpower-lean and efficiency movement in the business sector, especially in the SME sector.\n\nHe noted that there are an increasing number of applications now for help to transition to a lean manpower organisation.\n\n\"Some would require certain transitional manpower that MOM will support; many others do not need that. But, most importantly, they have now come to understand that with the manpower-lean economy, they are going to face a very tight manpower situation, and they have to go this way to be more automated and efficient with a manpower-lean workforce,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As a non-claimant state, we do not take sides on the merits of the individual competing territorial claims. But we support the peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with international law.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said, it is important for countries in north-east Asia to seek reconciliation and to move on.\n\nDr Balakrishnan noted that Singapore's former leader Lee Kwan Yew and the country made a conscious decision to have a forward-looking relationship with Japan, and to put the past behind, \"so that successive generations, so that our children and grandchildren, can look forward to a brighter future together\".\n\nConstructive, peaceful and cooperative relations between Japan and its immediate neighbours - China, South Korea and even North Korea - will benefit the entire region, he said.\n\n\"I believe that China understands the role that the US plays in the Asia-Pacific, but that China also has its own aspirations, and China's influence is growing, and therefore some element of competition between the two is inevitable.\n\n\"But confrontation is not inevitable. Fundamentally, the US and China have developed strong mutual interdependence, and therefore, I believe this makes all right-thinking leaders on both sides want to achieve constructive and stable ties between the US and China.\"\n\nJapan's State Minister for Foreign Affairs Seiji Kihara used the 11th edition of the symposium to make a call for the South China Sea to be maintained as a \"global commons\" against possible threats to the freedom of navigation in the region.\n\nSingapore's Ambassador-At-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tommy Koh told the symposium - organised by Japan's Institute of International Affairs and the National University of Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies - that all countries must abide by international law in dealing with maritime issues.\n\nDuring Dr Balakrishnan's visit to the Japanese capital, he met Mr Abe and members of his Cabinet, as well as the heads of Japanese business and industry.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Abe exchanged congratulatory letters to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between their two countries.\n\nMr Lee wrote: \"Over these 50 years, our bilateral relations have grown enormously. Today, Singapore and Japan enjoy excellent and multi-faceted ties, underpinned by shared strategic perspectives.\"\n\nIn his letter, Mr Abe said: \"Both our countries have achieved miraculous economic growth in such a short period of time. We share universal values such as the rule of law. Tapping more into these assets, I strongly believe we can elevate our bilateral relations to a higher level.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But asking how a would-be president might respond to crises is definitely fair game.\n\nAnd military emergencies are not the only kind of crisis to worry about. That 3 am call is one thing; but what about the 8 am call - the one warning that financial markets will melt down as soon as they open?\n\nFor make no mistake about it: The world economy is still a dangerous place. Financial reform has, I would argue, made our system somewhat more robust than it was in 2008, but fumbling the response to a shock could still have disastrous consequences. So what do we know about the shocks that we might face, and how the people who might be president would respond? Right now, there are two fairly obvious potential economic flash points: China and oil.\n\nMany economists, myself included, have been pointing out for a while that China has a severely unbalanced economy, with too little consumer spending and unsustainable levels of investment. So far, unfortunately, China has not made much progress in dealing with this fundamental imbalance; instead, it has papered over the problem with a huge expansion of credit. Now, with capital fleeing the country at the rate of a trillion dollars per year, it may well be headed for a bust. And China is a big enough player that a bust there could have major spillovers to the rest of the world.\n\nThen there is a potential oil crisis, very different from the ones that we used to have - the problem now is a glut, not a shortage, with many producers having run up large debts that they probably cannot repay. You could say that shale oil is the new subprime.\n\nNobody knows how big these problems could become, or what other potential crises we are missing. But it seems all too likely that the next president will have to deal with some kind of financial turmoil. How will she or he perform?\n\nAt this point, there are three candidates who have a serious chance of receiving their party's presidential nomination. Barring the political equivalent of a meteor strike, Mrs Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. Donald Trump is the clear frontrunner on the GOP side, but if he falls short of an outright majority on the first ballot, Ted Cruz might still pull it out. So what do we know about their economic policy skills?\n\nWell, Mrs Clinton is not just the most knowledgeable, well-informed candidate in this election, she is arguably the best-prepared candidate on matters economic ever to run for president. She could nonetheless mess up - but ignorance will not be the reason.\n\nOn the other side, I doubt that anyone will be shocked if I say that Mr Trump does not know much about economic policy - or for that matter, any kind of policy. He still seems to imagine, for example, that China is taking advantage of America by keeping its currency weak - which was true once upon a time, but bears no resemblance to current reality.\n\nOh, and coping with crisis in the modern world requires a lot of international cooperation. Things like currency swap lines (don't ask) played a much bigger role than most people realise in avoiding a second Great Depression. How well do you think that kind of cooperation would work in a Trump administration?\n\nYet things could be worse. The Donald does not know much, but Mr Cruz knows a lot that isn't so. In a world in which gold bugs have been wrong every step of the way, repeatedly predicting runaway inflation that fails to materialise, he demands a gold standard to produce a \"sound dollar\". He chose, as his senior economic adviser, Phil Gramm - an architect of financial deregulation who helped set the stage for the 2008 crisis, then dismissed warnings of recession when that crisis came, calling America a \"nation of whiners\". Mr Cruz is, in other words, a man of firm economic convictions - convictions that are utterly divorced from reality and impervious to evidence, to a degree that is unusual even among Republicans. A financial crisis with him in the White House could be, let us say, an interesting experience.\n\nI do not know how much play the candidates' readiness for economic emergencies will get in the general election. There will, after all, be so many horrifying positions, on everything from immigration to Planned Parenthood, to dissect. But let us try to make some room for this issue. For that 8 am call is probably coming, one way or another.

Asked when India might stop importing the power plant fuel altogether, Mr Goyal said: \"I wish it was yesterday. Maybe two or three years.\"\n\nIn recent years, India has been considered a possible saviour for beleaguered coal miners including Peabody Energy Corp that have suffered amid slowing Chinese demand and plummeting commodity prices. But it may be no white knight. In 2015, it increased its own production of the power plant fuel and slashed imports in \"a big way\", according to Andrew Cosgrove, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.\n\nThat trend will probably accelerate in coming years as India seeks to increase its annual electricity production fourfold by 2030, to as much as 4.5 trillion kwh from 1.1 trillion kwh at present, Mr Goyal said. State-owned Coal India Ltd, the world's biggest coal producer, plans to increase annual production to about one billion tonnes in the next four years, while India's overall domestic coal output could climb to 1.5 billion tonnes, he said.\n\nThe company, which produces more than 80 per cent of India's coal, reported record production and dispatches during the year ended March 31, after faster land purchases and government approvals led to the opening of new mines.\n\nIndia is developing new shipping routes and adding railroad capacity to transport domestic coal from mining areas to coastal power plants in hopes of further reducing its reliance on foreign coal.

They can't send electricity to the grid, and they'll need the special funds saved over decades for formal decommissioning and clean-up of radioactive waste.\n\nIn the past, many operators delayed decommissioning to allow growth in the clean-up funds. As the global economy weakened, however, and central banks kept interest rates low, the principal in some of those funds shrank. Last year in the US, seven of the 10 biggest funds lost money, falling to US$43.7 billion, a drop of 1.1 per cent. Now, with projected costs rising, industry advocates say owners are more likely to opt for full decommissioning before the funds decline further.\n\n\"One can't rely as much on fund growth as in the past,\" said Patrick Joseph O'Sullivan, a decommissioning specialist with the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"It's actually pushing utilities to think about bringing forward all this work because they're not able to rely any more on assuming high returns on investments.\"\n\nThe change in emphasis comes 30 years after the April 26, 1986, explosion at the Chernobyl reactor spread radioactive fallout across Europe. That event, followed 25 years later by meltdown at the Fukushima plant in Japan, undercut nuclear as a power generator as low-cost options like natural gas and renewable energies became increasingly available.\n\nA 2005 report by the IAEA forecast costs to shut a 1,000 megawatt reactor would range from 150 million euros (S$229 million) to 750 million euros. In the US, the country with the most decommissioning experience, actual costs have ranged from US$307 million to US$819 million, says the Nuclear Energy Agency.\n\nTwenty-four US decommissioning projects with site-specific estimates will require average clean-up funds of about US$750 million per reactor, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported. Those costs jive with an estimate by Exelon Corp, which operates reactors at 15 US nuclear power plants. Exelon estimates it will take US$1 billion to decommission its two-unit plant in Zion, Illinois. It told shareholders in February that \"sustained low market prices or depressed demand\" could accelerate \"asset retirement obligation expense related to future decommissioning activities\". Exelon's clean-up fund fell 2 per cent to US$10.3 billion last year.\n\nUtilities operating in Germany including EON SE, RWE AG and Vattenfall SE have set aside funds deemed \"acceptable\" by regulators to cover 47.5 billion euros of estimated costs to decommission the country's 17 reactors. Shares of those utilities jumped in February after reports that the German government would kick in an additional 17.7 billion euros to help store the radioactive waste.\n\n\"Understanding of these costs is fundamental for the development of estimates based on realistic decommissioning plans,\" the Paris-based Nuclear Energy Agency said last month in a 260-page report prepared for regulators and utilities. \"More and more questions are raised over the adequacy of the necessary infrastructure and human resources, as well as the ability and mechanisms to finance the costs.\"\n\nThere are 438 nuclear reactors in operation worldwide and less than 4 per cent of the power reactors built have been fully decommissioned. Fewer still have figured out how to store waste for the thousands of years it will remain dangerous. \"For us, the trend towards early dismantling has important advantages,\" said Mr O'Sullivan. \"It will contribute to better burden sharing between current and future generations.\"\n\nAbout US$200 billion will be spent worldwide in the next 20 years on decommissioning the world's aging fleet of reactors, Thomas LaGuardia, an American nuclear engineer who is helping the IAEA to establish decommissioning guidelines, said in an interview. Nuclear operators that haven't saved sufficient decommissioning funds may opt to put plants in safe storage until their accounts bulk up, he said.\n\nProject management and environmental remediation companies in the US and Europe could see their markets grow as utilities draw down decommissioning funds to shut aging reactors, Swedish radiation safety analyst Simon Carroll said in an interview. \"One person's cost is another man's income,\" he said.

One factor that it watches is slack in the labour market to see how much room the economy has to grow without triggering inflation.\n\nThe share of those 25 and older without high school diplomas who have jobs or are looking for one has risen 1.4 percentage points to 46.2 per cent in six months to March, close to levels before the 2007-09 recession. For high school graduates, that share has risen by a half percentage point, while among those with college degrees the rate has remained virtually steady.\n\nThe return of less-educated workers to the labour force is a sign that the economy is still healing from the recession.\n\nAmericans with no more than a high school education accounted for nearly four out of every five jobs lost in the recession, according to research by economists at Georgetown University. Since such workers are considered at the greatest risk of being permanently shut out of the labour force, it fuelled concerns that strains in the labour market might emerge even during spells of relatively modest economic growth.\n\nYet a Reuters analysis of Labor Department data suggested that there could be more labour market slack than the unemployment rate of 5 per cent may suggest because the improving economy has been spurring less-skilled workers to look for jobs again.\n\nTo count as part of the labour force, a worker needs to have held down a job or have actively searched for one in the last four weeks. Over the past year, in any given month there were about six million Americans who did not meet those criteria, a million more than before the recession.\n\nUntil recently, Nathan Patterson, 24, who left high school in Illinois without a diploma and later moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, was often one of them, discouraged by poor job prospects from looking for work consistently. Last year, though, a growing number of job openings posted in the area made him try again. In January, he found a job with a company that processes scrap steel. \"I went from having nothing to having something,\" he said. He makes US$10 an hour sweeping up, well below the national average of US$25.43 an hour, and trains to operate cranes and steel-cutting torches.\n\nNorth Carolina, where unemployment spiked more than nationally during the downturn and more workers dropped out of the workforce, has recovered lost ground faster thanks in part to strong growth in low-wage sectors such as retail, leisure and hospitality industries.\n\nNationally, they have created nearly a third of new jobs over the last year, although they only make up about fifth of total employment. Those industries also tend pay 30-40 per cent less than the national hourly average, which helps explain sluggish national wage growth in the past months and absence of significant cost pressures in the economy.\n\n\"There is more room to run in this cycle, and that means the Fed can afford to go slower on rate hikes in the beginning,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Michelle Meyer.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the Fed to raise rates twice this year, with the first move possibly in June, proceeding with caution because of concerns about the impact of global economic slowdown on the US economy.\n\nMinutes from the Fed's March 15-16 meeting show that policymakers discussed the recent increase in labour participation and that some noted that slack remained in the labour market.\n\nThat slack, in large part, is a result of gradually improving labour force participation driven primarily by more less skilled workers looking again for jobs, and many finding them.\n\nAcross the economy, companies continued to add about 200,000 jobs a month but the jobless rate has stayed roughly steady since October as around 400,000 people enter the workforce each month, many finding jobs right away.\n\nIn North Carolina, local officials said that they see more unemployed people going to community college to acquire skills that will help them find a better job, rather than to wait out a weak job market, which happened a lot during the recession.

Most see a 2 per cent growth.\n\nThe latest numbers showed that industrial production in March shrank by 0.5 per cent when compared to March last year. Excluding biomedical output, the fall was sharper at 5.5 per cent. These figures, released by the Economic Development Board (EDB), beat economists' consensus. An earlier Bloomberg survey of 19 economists put the median estimate of the headline figure at a 2 per cent year-on-year decline.\n\nTheir decision to revise GDP estimates puts a spotlight on the multiple risks to growth faced by Singapore's economy in recent quarters. More importantly, it also might hint at the bottoming out of the manufacturing sector's prolonged recession. It has been shrinking for 18 months now, the longest on record.\n\nDBS senior economist Irvin Seah summed up this cautious optimism in a note: \"We can either continue to stay cautious on growth outlook or we can immediately pop the champagne. Much really depends on whether we prefer to judge Tuesday's outcome by its glossy cover or to read between the lines.\"\n\nFebruary's output was revised to a smaller 3.8 per cent decline, while January saw a 1.1 per cent growth.\n\nTaking the three months' data together, economists estimate headline industrial production in the first quarter to be at a 1 per cent year-on-year contraction.\n\nTuesday's data contrasts with the manufacturing sector's 2 per cent on year contraction in Q1, as seen in the government's flash estimates issued in mid-April. The government had also put Q1 GDP growth at 1.8 per cent year-on-year.\n\nBack then, economists feared that there was broad-based weakeness in the economy, prompting some of them to downgrade full-year forecasts.\n\nBut with Tuesday's data, some are going back to the drawing board to look at Q1 growth numbers again.\n\nThey pointed out that industrial production numbers have a strong correlation to manufacturing GDP growth, which in turn affect overall GDP numbers.\n\n\"All else equal, Q1 GDP growth could be revised up to positive 2 per cent YoY, positive 0.1 per cent qoq saar (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted, annual rate),\" wrote Citi's Kit Wei Zheng.\n\nJoining in the chorus of an upwards revision for Q1 growth are Nomura at 2.2 per cent, and CIMB, DBS, Mizuho and UOB at 2 per cent.\n\nBut the economists have also cautioned against optimism at the upwards revision.\n\nA common reason cited was that poor performance in previous months made it easy for factory output to surge ahead in March.\n\nFor example, the semiconductor segment fell by 23.3 per cent y-o-y in March last year, and expanded by 21.7 per cent in March this year. This helped the electronics sector report an output growth of 5.8 per cent.\n\n\"It's a statistical quirk that numbers have improved this time round,\" Nomura analyst Brian Tan said.\n\nAlso, Q1 data can be distorted by the Lunar New Year, as factories tend to ramp up production before the holiday lull, said economists. With the dates of the festival not fixed, they can have an impact on the base effects of production in March.\n\nEconomists have also noted that changes in output across the sector in March was uneven, signalling that manfuacturing is not out of the woods yet.\n\nFor example, while electronics posted growth, the transport engineering and petrochemicals segments are still in recession, said Standard Chartered's Jeff Ng.\n\n\"This uptick from more dismal start to 2016 is welcome; this merely 're-arranges the deck chairs on the Titanic',\" said Mizuho's Vishnu Varathan. \"Put another way, the difference in data does not mean that the outlook, and hence policy implications, are not the same.\"\n\nBut some economists are looking up as macroeconomic conditions change.\n\nUOB's Francis Tan referred to the better news coming out from the United States, saying that job numbers and wages are improving there. \"These point to a modestly positively trend for manufacturing,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It said prices from Nomura Holdings Inc showed the cost to protect Malaysia's sovereign notes with credit-default swaps was up by 1 basis point to 165 basis points.\n\nFinancial markets expect more turmoil given the major disagreements between both sovereign funds including a dispute over payments amounting to US$3.5 billion by 1MDB to IPIC subsidiary Aabar Investments PJS.\n\nA Malaysian parliamentary select committee looking into 1MDB found the funds had been transferred to a similarly named company Aabar Investments PJS Ltd that was registered in the British Virgin Islands and since de-registered. IPIC and Aabar maintain the BVI registered company is not part of their group.\n\nMr Arul now contends the possibility of a \"massive fraud\" perpetuated by IPIC and Aabar's former chief executives, Khadem Al Qubaisi and Mohamed Badawy Al Husseiny, both currently being questioned by Abu Dhabi authorities. In 2012 under Mr Khadem's leadership, IPIC had guaranteed two 1MDB bond tranches totalling US$3.5 billion plus US$2 billion in interest in return for which 1MDB put down an initial US$1.4 billion deposit with the BVI-registered Aabar.\n\nOn the missed coupon payment, 1MDB maintains IPIC agreed to pay under a binding term sheet entered into in May 2015.\n\nIPIC, however, asserts that 1MDB and the finance ministry are in breach of the terms of the binding sheet and other ancillary documents, and hence its and Aabar's obligations under the sheet have terminated. Moreover, it claims the finance ministry agreed to indemnify IPIC for all amounts it may be required to pay in respect of the notes and guarantees.\n\nMr Pua, who sat on the select committee, said under the inter-guarantor agreement, IPIC would ultimately make a claim on the finance ministry for whatever sums paid on 1MDB's behalf.\n\nSuch is the mayhem since IPIC rather belatedly asserted this month that it had not received the purported US$3.5 billion in payments that 1MDB's debt rationalisation plan has come apart.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak who has become inextricably linked with 1MDB's problems since he ultimately called the shots in the entity that was established under his watch, is understood to be furious about recent developments.\n\nJust as 1MDB's massive debts of RM50 billion appeared to be more manageable after energy and property assets were sold, IPIC's intransigence has blown the plan wide open. Worse, corporate executives say its disgruntled former ally could throw up even more discomforting facts about 1MDB, the transactions of which have raised red flags and investigations locally and in at least six countries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Swift confirmed to Reuters the authenticity of the notice.\n\nSwift, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a cooperative owned by 3,000 financial institutions.\n\nAlso on Monday, Swift released a security update to the software that banks use to access its network to thwart malware that security researchers with British defence contractor BAE Systems said was probably used by hackers in the Bangladesh Bank heist.\n\nBAE's evidence suggested that hackers manipulated Swift's Alliance Access server software, which banks use to interface with Swift's messaging platform, to cover their tracks.\n\nBAE said that it could not explain how the fraudulent orders were created and pushed through the system.\n\nBut Swift provided some evidence about how that happened in its note to customers, saying that in most cases the modus operandi was similar.\n\nIt said that the attackers obtained valid credentials for operators authorised to create and approve Swift messages, then submitted fraudulent messages by impersonating those people.\n\nFireEye, the Internet security company whose Mandiant unit was hired by Bangladesh Bank to help investigate the heist, said that the same group behind that hack had probably attacked other financial targets.\n\n\"FireEye has observed activity in other financial services organisations that is likely by the same threat actor behind the cyber attack on the Bank of Bangladesh,\" Vivek Chudgar, Mandiant's senior director for the Asia-Pacific said in a statement. FireEye declined to go into detail.\n\nRakesh Asthana, the World Informatix Cyber Security CEO, who is overseeing Bangladesh Bank's probe into the hack, declined to discuss the other attacks that Swift referred to. He did, though, urge banks to conduct independent security assessments to make sure that their networks are secure and prevent future attacks.\n\n\"Swift builds on security practices established by the customer itself and therefore it is imperative that in the wake of this attack, customers using Swift Alliance Access must strengthen their cyber security posture,\" Mr Asthana said.\n\nCyber security experts said that more attacks could surface as Swift's banking clients look to see if their Swift access has been compromised.\n\nShane Shook, a banking security consultant who investigates large financial crime, said that hackers were turning to Swift and other private financial messaging platforms because such attacks can generate more revenue than going after consumers or small businesses.\n\n\"These hacks specifically target financial institutions because smaller efforts result in much larger thefts,\" he said. \"It's much more efficient than stealing from consumers.\"\n\nJustin Harvey, chief security officer with Fidelis Cybersecurity, said that hackers followed the money and would be drawn into such schemes in hopes of emulating a big heist like the one on Bangladesh Bank. \"After the Bangladesh Bank heist became public, every other attacker out there is looking to see if they can do the same,\" he said.\n\nSwift spokeswoman Natasha Deteran told Reuters that the commonality in these cases was that internal or external attackers compromised the banks' own environments to obtain valid operator credentials. \"Customers should do their utmost to protect against this,\" she said.

Why does a company need to have a board? From a purely legalistic perspective, the answer seems obvious: Since 2012, Singapore's Code of Corporate Governance has stated that the board of a publicly listed company should bear responsibility for the company's long-term success.\n\nIn practice, this is somewhat more complicated. What qualifies as long-term success, and how does the board influence it? What should the board actually do? And what about companies that are not publicly listed, or non-profit organisations? Do they need a board of directors, and if they have one, should the board's role be the same as that of a publicly listed company's board?\n\nOne way of getting some clarity of the board's role is to view it from a stewardship perspective. Stewardship is defined as \"the act of safeguarding and enhancing an organisation's capability to create economic and societal value over time\". Stewardship is also about fulfilling one's responsibility in growing the assets entrusted such that they would be handed over in better shape. In practice, this means that the board's purpose is to find a way of responsibly maximising the company's value-creation abilities over the long term, and to constructively guide the company's management in carrying out that strategy.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nThe perverse globalism of Donald Trump\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

As a consumer market, Asean in fact surpasses India in size, and is close to coastal China. This has significant prospects for a whole range of businesses catering to the Asean middle class, with consumer spending at US$1.2 trillion today, and estimated to keep growing as this group expands.\"\n\nHe added that, with an underlying appetite in the Asean middle class for increasingly sophisticated products and services, foreign direct investment in manufacturing in the region can be expected to keep growing.\n\nHowever, Mr Tharman warned that technology is re-shaping the consumption, production and distribution of goods, so retailers and brand owners will need to embrace changes to grow their businesses.\n\nHe applauded LF Logistics for being a good example in the adoption of \"omni-channel\" logistics networks, for managing not only Nike's retail store, but also its global e-commerce supply chain.\n\nIn fact, he added, Nike's first global e-commerce distribution centre for Asian sizes will be managed by LF Logistics out of the new facility.\n\nOn Singapore's urban logistics, Mr Tharman said that the transformation of logistics networks to support e-commerce and omni-channel solutions will be greatly facilitated by common infrastructure; he emphasized the importance of overcoming the obstacles that exist in the industry and of promoting innovation in last-mile delivery.\n\nA key initiative he cited was the large-scale deployment of parcel lockers within Singapore, a development which is expected to ease last-mile delivery challenges for small parcels. This common locker model will be implemented in areas with higher demand first and then rolled out across the island.\n\nHe added that he believes Singapore will be the first country to implement such a system nationwide.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Hang Seng first dropped sharply before closing in the black while the June Dow contract traded 19 points higher at 5pm local time.\n\nThe index's fall was led by the three banks ahead of their release of first quarter figures. UOB will announce its results on Thursday, OCBC on Friday and DBS on Tuesday.\n\nIn an April 25 report on the banks, HSBC Global Research said market concerns could shift away from asset quality to slowing growth.\n\n\"Slowing loan growth could lead to a lower loan deposit ratio and NIM (net interest margin) pressure. Also, capital that was tied up in loans would be freed up,'' said HSBC.\n\nIt said UOB is its preferred pick as it believes the interests of its major shareholders are completely aligned with long- term minority shareholders. \"We also like DBS ... given how it has optimised its balance sheet and business mix since 2009. We downgrade OCBC ... to 'hold' from 'buy' following the rebound in its share price.''\n\nIn the second line, shares of Raffles Medical Group (RMG) ended S$0.03 higher at S$4.58 on volume of 859,100. The company earlier in the week announced a 3.7 per cent increase in profit after tax and minority interests to S$15.5 million for the first quarter, a result that OCBC Investment Research described as being within expectations.\n\n\"With our estimates largely unchanged, we are keeping our fair value estimate of S$4.72, but in view of the limited upside from its current share price, we downgrade the stock to a 'hold','' said the broker.\n\nRHB, on the other hand, noted that RMG managed a creditable performance and said it expects RMG's share price to continue re-rating as the investor base broadens along with its regional operations. The broker maintained its \"buy'' call on RMG with S$5.10 target price.\n\nMorgan Stanley in its Tuesday China Macro Meets Micro report said it is maintaining its base case that the mini-cycle recovery will continue for another three to four months and growth is likely to moderate from August to September.\n\n\"We are concerned about the deteriorating quality of the cyclical improvement, as it has been mainly a government-led recovery in investment, exacerbating the structural problems of high debt, excess capacity and persistent disinflationary pressures,'' said Morgan Stanley.\n\n\" That said, we expect a growth moderation rather than a notable slowdown comparable to 1Q15 in our base case, as overall policy will remain accommodative.'' Morgan Stanley said it sees downside risk of 9-11 per cent for China equities.\n\nOver in the US, the Federal Reserve meets over Tuesday and Wednesday to decide if interest rates need to be raised. ABN Amro in its Global Daily Insight said it thinks the Fed's statement will continue to signal caution, with the \"balanced risk\" assessment set out in December remaining absent from the statement.\n\n\"GDP growth remains weak in the first quarter after an already weak fourth quarter. During the March meeting, participants were equally divided as to whether they judged risks to the forecasts of GDP growth to be weighed to the downside or broadly balanced,'' said ABN.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As a politician, one must be aware of that,\" Takeshi Noda, an adviser to the LDP panel, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nUnlike the United States, where Donald Trump has made immigration an election issue, Japan has little history of immigration. But, that makes ethnic and cultural diversity seem more of a threat in Japan than it may seem elsewhere.\n\nAnd while Japan is not caught up in the mass migration crisis afflicting Europe, the controversies in other regions do colour the way Japanese think about immigration.\n\nLDP lawmakers floated immigration proposals almost a decade ago, but those came to naught. Since then, however, labour shortages have worsened and demographic forecasts have become more dire.\n\nAn economic uptick since Mr Abe took office in December 2012, rebuilding after the 2011 tsunami and a construction boom ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have pushed labour demand to its highest in 24 years.\n\nThat has helped boost foreign worker numbers by 40 per cent since 2013, with Chinese accounting for more than one-third followed by Vietnamese, Filipinos and Brazilians.\n\nBut visa conditions largely barring unskilled workers mean foreigners still make up only about 1.4 per cent of the workforce, compared with the 5 per cent or more found - according to IMF estimates - in most advanced economies.\n\nSo far, measures to attract more foreign workers have focused on easing entry for highly skilled professionals and expanding a \"trainee\" system that was designed to share technology with developing countries, but which critics say has become a backdoor source of cheap labour.\n\nThis time, the LDP panel leaders' proposal went further, suggesting foreigners be accepted in other sectors facing shortages, such as nursing and farming - initially for five years with visa renewal possible.\n\nThey also proposed creating a framework whereby the number of foreign workers would be doubled from around 908,000 currently, and the term \"unskilled labour\" would be abandoned.\n\nIn a sign of the sensitivities, however - especially ahead of a July upper house election - panel chief Yoshio Kimura stressed that the proposal should not be misconstrued as an \"immigration policy\" and said steps were needed to offset any negative impact on jobs and public safety.\n\nAfter a heated debate in which one lawmaker said the plan would \"leave Japan in tatters\", members agreed to let the panel organisers decide whether to make any revisions to the proposal.

The Fed, which is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, will announce its decision on Wednesday while the BOJ concludes its two-day meeting on Thursday.\n\nSpeculation of further easing by the BOJ sent the yen lower last week, but it staged a recovery on Tuesday. The dollar fell 0.3 per cent to 110.85 yen, retreating from a three-week high of 111.90 hit the previous day. The euro fetched 125 yen, down 0.2 per cent and off Monday's three-week peak of 125.525.\n\nThe yen lost 2.1 per cent in value against the dollar on Friday - its biggest one-day fall since BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced a second round of monetary easing in October 2014. The trigger was a Bloomberg report that said the BOJ was considering applying negative rates to its lending programme for financial institutions.\n\nA policy decision will be a close call.\n\n\"The yen lost a lot of ground on Friday, so there is some speculative unwinding of positions ahead of the BOJ meeting,\" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. \"With dollar/yen above 110 yen and the Japanese stock market stabilising, there is a chance that the BOJ may hold back and disappoint those anticipating aggressive easing.\"\n\nThe BOJ introduced negative rates earlier this year, charging commercial banks 0.1 per cent interest on a small portion of their reserves.

The rating was lowered to AA+, S&P said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe oil-market crash that began in late 2014 has choked crude-producing nations like Nigeria and Venezuela of cash, thrown hundreds of thousands of employees out of work, stalled drilling and pipeline investments around the world and even reverberated into ancillary industries such as steel-making and railroads. Exxon was one of the last holdouts against the wave of credit downgrades that engulfed oil drillers with diminishing prospects of paying debts, dividends and rig fees.\n\nThe downgrade will not only raise Exxon's cost to borrow money but may also erode its status among oil-rich governments as a premier partner with which to do business. As Exxon Vice President of Investor Relations Jeffrey Woodbury said in February, the company's AAA rating has been a key selling point when competing for drilling licenses.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

It has prompted exchanges in Shanghai, Dalian and Zhengzhou to boost fees or issue warnings to investors. Wu Zhili, an analyst from Shenhua Futures Co estimated that as much as 70 per cent of trading in Chinese iron ore and steel futures is retail investors speculating on price movements, as opposed to producers or consumers using contracts to hedge.\n\nAnalysis of aggregate open interest, volumes and trading hours give a further clue as to the nature of the investors driving the frenzy. \"The fact that duration of trade is shorter than usual confirms our fear that a big role in this current rally of prices has been fuelled by private, short-term traders chasing momentum,\" said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, managing director of Milan-based consultancy T-Commodity srl. \"This dynamic increases the risk of an overshooting of the commodities market compared to fundamentals.\"\n\nDividing the average aggregate open interest at the end of each day by the aggregate volume shows the number of futures traded for every outstanding contract. Multiply that ratio by the number of hours in each trading day and you get an estimate for the average tenure of each contract.\n\nFor iron ore and steel rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, it is under four hours; for West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange it is almost 40. Natural gas is nearly 70 hours.\n\n\"Trading volumes on Chinese exchanges are already enormous,\" said Shenhua Futures' Mr Wu. \"Activity in the iron and steel markets has also been very active after the rally, and this has attracted more participants, including retail investors.\"\n\nRebar in Shanghai surged almost 20 per cent in the first four days of last week, peaking on Thursday at 2,750 yuan (S$573) a tonne, its highest since September 2014. Prices fell back 4.8 per cent on Friday after the exchange raised trading fees. It was at 2,638 yuan at 10 am in Shanghai on Tuesday. Total volumes surged to a record of almost 24 million lots.\n\nVolumes are exaggerated because exchanges count both sides of the trade, long and short, said Han Yun, a spokesman for the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Some investors traded multiple times, opening and closing positions repeatedly within the day, he added.\n\n\"Commodities in China, especially the ferrous products experienced big volatility and active trading these days, showing heated sentiment,\" said Wang Weijun, a spokesman for the Dalian exchange. \"The Dalian Commodity Exchange has raised trading costs, adjusted maximum moves allowed in a day and other measures to pre-empt risks brought by overheated trading.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM\n\nChina solar stocks surge as Beijing moves to calm price wars\n\nJul 10, 2025 07:16 PM", "images": []}

Since mid-2015, shares of Singapore banks have been highly correlated with oil prices, and they have bounced higher in tandem with the higher oil prices.\n\nUBS analyst Aakash Rawat said in a report this month: \"The risks from the oil and gas exposures are better understood now; risk from SME exposures look underappreciated though.\"\n\nCiting the tepid business outlook for SMEs, he noted that UOB commands the highest share in the SME market, and that the bank's risk weights for corporate lending has correspondingly risen faster than average in the last few quarters. UOB is his least preferred stock of the trio.\n\n\"The resilience in the SME sector and less-than-expected impact on the banks' asset quality so far has been rather surprising. We think this might be changing at the margin and looks like an imminent headwind.\"\n\nAnalysts remain worried that Singapore banks will still come under pressure from oil and gas exposure.\n\nMorgan Stanley in a report this month: \"We now believe that Singapore banks have seen the benefit of this oil price recovery, and further progress will be much tougher.\n\n\"The recent rise in the oil price no doubt helps the global majors; it has also allowed some refinancing of the US shale producers, but it is unlikely to alter the overcapacity issues in the support-services sector, which is where the Singapore banks' credit concerns have focused.\"\n\nAt a shareholders' meeting this month, OCBC chief Samuel Tsien said that if oil prices stabilised at US$30 to US$40 per barrel, most OCBC customers would be able to ride through this industry downturn.\n\nHis peer, UOB chief Wee Ee Cheong, similarly told shareholders that the bank's overall credit exposure was manageable.\n\nDBS holds its shareholders' meeting this week.\n\nMr Wee added then, that China's rebalancing from manufacturing to services will be beneficial in the long run, backed by increasing connectivity within Asia.\n\nStill, in China, where DBS in particular has significant exposure, many firms in the industrial sector are grappling with massive overcapacity issues, said Andrew Wood, head of Asia country risk research, BMI Research.\n\n\"While it is unlikely that Singaporean banks have much direct exposure to such firms, they do have exposure to China's top-tier banks, which are vulnerable to rising NPLs (non-performing loans) from the growing number of firms that are unable to service their debts,\" he said.\n\nOther analysts have taken it easy. S&P analyst Ivan Tan pointed out that risks from China will fall, as the majority of exposure here is through trade finance, which is short-term in nature. That has shrunk considerably, and is because the arbitrage trade that benefited from the cheaper borrowing rates for offshore yuan has run off.\n\n\"It's a self-correcting risk,\" said Mr Tan. He also sees no danger from the property-cooling measures and the impact on mortgage delinquencies. Despite more workers being laid off last year and taking a longer time to find new jobs, Singapore remains statistically at full employment. The Sibor (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate), used to price floating home loans, has also fallen as the Federal Reserve holds off rate hikes, he noted.\n\n\"Our outlook for Singapore banks is one of stability,\" he said.\n\nHSBC said in a report this week that the first-quarter results \"should reaffirm the asset-quality resilience of these banks\". HSBC analyst Loo Kar Weng said: \"We expect negligible increases in NPL ratios, with marginal impact on credit costs. Market concerns could shift away from asset quality to growth.\"\n\nLoan growth for the full year is expected at around 5 per cent, at best, analysts said.\n\nMorgan Stanley will also keep an eye on the impact of more regulations on dividend payouts. The introduction of new rules to measure credit risk on derivative counterparties and market risk could add up to 10 per cent to risk-weighted assets, it said, though noting that rules are still uncertain.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore will on Wednesday release its macroeconomic review that will touch on the banking sector.\n\nUOB releases its first-quarter results on Thursday; OCBC does so the following day, and DBS, on May 3.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Lee was promoted to his current post last September.\n\nTemasek on Tuesday said its organisation structure change is aimed at aligning the firm with its core priorities in these challenging global times.\n\n\"Temasek thinks long term and acts as an owner in all that we do,\" said Mr Lee. \"At a strategic level, the changes we're making position the organisation to protect and work the Temasek portfolio, and continue to build capabilities as we grow.\"\n\nWith effect from May 1, senior managing directors Chia Song Hwee and Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara will be appointed presidents. And Fidah Alsagoff, Michael Buchanan, Png Chin Yee and Juliet Teo will be promoted to senior managing directors from managing directors.\n\nMr Lee said that, on the institution front, \"we will use the opportunity to further build agility, alignment and accountability, as we continue on our journey to being a high-performing global organisation.\n\n\"We continue to preserve a strong partnership culture within our senior leadership team, leveraging our leaders' complementary skillsets.\"\n\nThe changes include bringing together sector and market investment teams under a single investment group headed jointly by Mr Chia and Mr Sandrasegara.\n\nThere will also be a new portfolio strategy and risk group to bring an increased focus to the resilience of Temasek's portfolio and better position the group in light of dynamic market conditions; and the creation of a new sustainability and stewardship group, to lead initiatives around the themes of sustainability and stewardship.\n\nThe changes will streamline the investment teams which have got somewhat unwieldy, said sources.\n\nThe idea is that the \"investment professionals' input gets priority and is better reflected\", said one source.\n\n\"This will realign those who invest, who bring in the bacon\", into focus, he said. \"Markets are topsy turvy. It's focusing on what's important. Temasek is an investment company, first and foremost,\" he said.\n\nTemasek's 21 senior managers used to sit on all the management committees including the investment committees, said another source.\n\nNow, the number of the various committees will be whittled down to 10-15, making them more manageable, the second source said.\n\n\"We are operating in challenging times, with many uncertainties in the global economy,\" Mr Lee said. \"It highlights to all of us, at Temasek, the need to focus on protecting and working our portfolio, while continuing to build a stronger institution which positions us to meet these current and future challenges.\"\n\nThe reorganisation invariably raises the question of succession planning for when Ho Ching, Temasek Holdings' executive director and CEO, steps down.\n\nSuccession planning for leadership positions is a key responsibility of senior management, said Temasek spokesman Stephen Forshaw.\n\n\"As part of the succession planning process, we constantly look to develop our executives and to seek talent to complement our senior management bench strength,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the new organisation structure supports the priorities that Mr Lee and his senior team have been developing since he took over as CEO of TI last year.\n\nIn his current role, Mr Lee oversees the execution of Temasek's commercial strategies and leads the management team at Temasek, Mr Forshaw said.\n\n\"Ho Ching continues to remain engaged in the business, continuing in her dual roles as chairman of Temasek International and CEO of Temasek Holdings, in which she exercises her stewardship and constitutional responsibilities,\" he added.\n\nSeparately, Temasek also announced that Boon Sim, head of Americas, will be leaving Temasek and relinquishing his current executive responsibilities on May 1. He will continue to support as an advisory senior director.\n\n\"In his new advisory role, Boon will continue to help us build and strengthen our network in the US, serve on some boards, and also advise us on relevant projects and initiatives,\" said Mr Forshaw.\n\nMr Sandrasegara takes over as head, Americas, in addition to his other responsibilities.\n\nCommenting on the changes, National University of Singapore associate professor Mak Yuen Teen said it seems Temasek is consolidating expertise which has heretofore been distributed across the group in investment, risks and stewardship.\n\n\"This makes sense to me to maximise the utilisation of the expertise in making decisions in these areas,\" said Prof Mak, who is also a corporate governance advocate.\n\nTemasek reported a total shareholder return of 19.2 per cent for the year ended March 31, 2015, as its net portfolio value rose S$43 billion to S$266 billion, thanks to a global equity rally. In terms of geographic exposure by underlying assets, Singapore and China were highest at 28 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.\n\nSince then, markets have been choppy and global growth sluggish; the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is down 33 per cent from a year ago but the S&P 500 is only very slightly lower, down 1.4 per cent over the same period.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank is seeking to sell at least US$4.4 billion of assets in Asia, including US$1.4 billion of distressed loans to Indian companies, and wants to dispose of more loans from Africa and the Middle East, people familiar with the matter said this month. Special-situations funds including Hong Kong's SSG Capital Management and KKR & Co have expressed interest, the people said.\n\nMr Winters has been shrinking the lender's balance sheet after the unchecked growth under his predecessor Peter Sands, who was replaced last June after eight years as CEO.\n\nTotal assets at the lender shrank to US$640 billion last year after climbing to a peak of US$726 billion at the end of 2014, company filings show. Standard Chartered generates 72 per cent of its revenue in Asia and deploys almost three-quarters of its loans in the region.\n\nMr Winters has also raised US$5.1 billion of cash from investors, scrapped the dividend and announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs to help save US$2.9 billion by 2018. The CEO also cut the firm's profitability target and is now aiming for a 10 per cent return on equity by 2020. It made a negative 0.4 per cent return last year.\n\n\"The first stage of Bill Winters' strategy - to address StanChart's problems with risk controls, asset quality and capital - has made significant progress in our view,\" Raul Sinha, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co with an overweight rating on the stock, said before the results were published.\n\n\"Management is now likely to turn focus to asset disposals and narrowing the performance gap to peers.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/b671f9f499a13294c5484e1fa42f0d5cec158bd83832ee0155c4653ec0303c84?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Standard Chartered is contending with a sharp drop in revenue amid surging loan impairments after the commodity market crashed and growth stalled from China to India."}]}

We migrants are supporting candidates who want to help.\"\n\nThe majority of Hong Kong's Filipino workers are domestic helpers, an often-abused underclass in the wealthy city, whose plight has been highlighted by several recent legal cases.\n\nBut there is a sense of empowerment now, as they form part of a key demographic candidates are keen to corner: the 1.3 million Filipinos who are registered to cast absentee ballots.\n\nMs Blaza is backing controversial candidate Rodrigo Duterte, who leads the polls despite remarks about the rape and murder of an Australian missionary that sparked protests from diplomats, the Catholic Church and women's groups. Likened by some to controversial US Republican candidate Donald Trump, he is held up by supporters as a maverick with a solution to corruption and crime.\n\nFor Filipina voter Madeline, 26 - who has a nursing degree but gets a higher salary working as a maid in Hong Kong - the ballot box is a chance to clean up politics.\n\n\"Crime is very rampant, especially corruption in the government,\" she said, without specifying her favoured candidate.\n\nFilipinos working overseas - primarily in Asia, North America and the Middle East - sent more than US$25 billion in remittances home to their impoverished country last year, giving them extra political clout.\n\n\"The votes of migrant workers can be a game-changer,\" added Eman Villanueva, an activist for Migrante, a political party that campaigns for the rights of foreign workers. \"This is a close fight and every vote counts.\"\n\nMr Duterte's son visited Hong Kong as part of the campaign, as did rival candidate Mar Roxas.\n\nUS-educated investment banker Roxas and Grace Poe, a movie star's adopted daughter, are among those taking on Mr Duterte, a tough-talking mayor who has been accused of running death squads in his city.\n\nVoting started earlier this month in Hong Kong, where more than 93,000 Filipinos are registered to vote, and ends on election day in the Philippines, May 9.\n\nBut, whichever candidate they favour, most simply want to make a living back home.\n\n\"The long-term goal is to have jobs available in the Philippines so we don't have to leave our country to survive,\" says Mr Villanueva.\n\nFor Ms Blaza, return is the ultimate aim. \"I really want to go back to my family,\" she added.

Prices peaked last month at their highest since February 2015.\n\n\"The rally so far in 2016 developed too rapidly in our view, and with poor demand from Asia we expect the gold price to ease sooner rather than later, particularly if fears about the global economy continue to abate,\" GFMS said in the report.\n\nDemand for the metal will improve later in the year, however, as lower prices attract Asian buyers back to the market, it said.\n\n\"This correction to comfortably below US$1,200 will aid a recovery in demand from the east, and this will ensure that prices stay well above cyclical lows,\" it said. \"Thereafter, gold prices are set to resume their bull run (to) around US$1,300 an ounce towards year-end.\"\n\nIndian jewellery consumption fell 56 per cent to an eight-year low in the first quarter, GFMS said, negatively affected by surging prices and a jewellers' strike that persisted through March.\n\nChinese jewellery demand slid 28 per cent year on year, its weakest start to a year since the GFMS data series began in 2000.

We cannot let (that) happen again by standing still.\"\n\nBritain has had a patchy record with government IT systems.

Many compare the current level of development to the early days of the Internet.\n\nEarlier this year, the government's chief scientific adviser urged the government to explore how it could use blockchain.
