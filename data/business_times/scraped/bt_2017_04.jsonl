Both lenders are based in Riyadh, with HSBC owning 40 per cent of SABB.\n\nThe negotiations come as banks grapple with how to approach the Middle East's biggest economy, which is embarking on an unprecedented diversification and privatisation plan but still blocks foreign control of local banks.\n\nThe combined entity would be the kingdom's biggest after National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi Bank, and follows the merger of other regional lenders as they battle with sustained low oil prices, slower economic growth and a decline in asset quality.\n\n\"The current environment is ideal for mergers,\" Jaap Meijer, head of equity research at Arqaam Capital Ltd, said by telephone.\n\n\"Growth opportunities are limited, and banks need to cut costs to still deliver returns for shareholders.\"\n\nThe combination will also make it easier for RBS to exit Saudi Arabia \"as it will hold a smaller stake in a bigger, stronger bank\".\n\nShares in SABB climbed 6.2 per cent on the Saudi stock exchange at 10.41am in Riyadh, while Alawwal jumped 9.7 per cent.\n\nRBS has for years tried unsuccessfully to sell its Alawwal holding, which is worth about US$1.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAny interest in the stake came from local or regional groups, according to analysts and people familiar with the transactions. Credit Agricole SA, which is also considering the sale of its 31 per cent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, has failed to attract big-name global banks, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nA deal would mark Saudi Arabia's first banking industry merger for almost 20 years and could prompt other deals. Samba Financial Group merged with United Saudi Bank in 1999, creating one of the largest regional financial institutions at the time, of which Citigroup owned 23 per cent, according to Samba's website. Saudi Arabia is currently home to about 33 million people and 26 banks - 12 local and 14 foreign lenders.\n\n\"The history of mergers in the country is checkered as a few have tried and been unsuccessful,\" said Muhammad Potrik, head of research at Riyad Capital.\n\nIf this deal is successful it \"could be a precursor to the start of a M&A trend in the banking and other sectors such as petrochemicals, insurance and retail\".\n\nElsewhere in the Gulf Cooperation Council, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC and First Gulf Bank PJSC last month completed a merger to create the United Arab Emirates' largest bank with assets of US$180 billion. Qatar's Masraf Al Rayan QSC, Barwa Bank QSC and International Bank of Qatar QSC announced plans for a three-way merger last year.\n\nBoth Alawwal and SABB primarily lend to businesses, not consumers, and both reported that non-performing loans to the construction and building industry more than tripled in 2016.\n\nLending by Saudi banks to the private sector was expanding rapidly as recently as last year, but has since stalled. In February, annual growth slowed to 0.3 per cent, the lowest figure since 2009.\n\nAlawwal and SABB also have large common shareholders, with the billionaire Olayan family holding about 22 per cent in Alawwal and about 17 per cent in SABB, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. State-controlled Public Institution for Social Security holds a 10.5 per cent stake in Alawwal and 9.74 per cent in SABB, according to the data.\n\nSome global banks are investing in Saudi Arabia in preparation for an expected fee bonanza. As part of efforts to repair state finances damaged by a slump in oil prices, the kingdom plans to create the world's largest sovereign fund and sell hundreds of state assets, including Saudi Arabian Oil Co. The IPO could value the company at US$2 trillion and generate millions of dollars in fees.\n\nCitigroup Inc on Tuesday said it received an investment banking license from the kingdom's regulator after 13 years. The New York-based lender lost its license when it sold its stake in Samba Financial Group in 2004.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM\n\nHelen Wong to retire as OCBC CEO; Tan Teck Long named successor\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:25 PM\n\nChina\u2019s GDP growth set to slow, raising pressure on policymakers\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:34 PM\n\nCitigroup sets mid-2026 target of 1,150 for MSCI\u2019s global equity index\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:04 PM\n\nChinese banks stumble on Beijing\u2019s consumer lending push\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:16 PM\n\nJapan\u2019s MUFG targets US for securitisation business, plans to boost headcount\n\nJul 11, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nPBOC adviser urges 1.5 trillion yuan stimulus to counter US tariffs\n\nJul 11, 2025 01:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/86603a0701b560bd2b6bbe8382239cafb28cd41816ca291174f02370b19f7fb3?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "HSBC Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's Saudi Arabia ventures are exploring a potential merger to create the kingdom's third-largest lender with US$78 billion in assets."}]}

Banks themselves have been raising mortgage rates.\n\nAfter cutting interest rates to a record low of 1.5 per cent last August, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has warned further easing would only encourage more borrowing by already heavily indebted households.\n\n\"The higher cost of debt, as well as stricter lending and servicing criteria, has likely dented investment demand over recent months,\" said CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless.\n\nHowever, \"We need to be cautious in calling a peak in the market after only one month of soft results\". The CoreLogic data showed home prices in Sydney were flat in April but the annual pace of growth was still a blistering 16 per cent.\n\nMelbourne grew 0.5 per cent in the month with annual growth at 15.3 per cent.\n\nCanberra, another hot market, suffered a fall of 2.8 per cent.\n\nHobart was the strongest housing market, growing at one per cent, with an annual gain at 13.6 per cent.\n\nLawless noted the rush into investment properties and an expanding supply of apartments has driven yields to record lows in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nThe slowdown in yields has in turn been a major drag on consumer price inflation, which hit record lows late last year.\n\nSince January 2009, home values in Sydney have more than doubled while Melbourne has increased by 93 per cent.\n\nThe inexorable price rise in the major cities has taken homes out of the reach of many first-time buyers and become a political hot potato.\n\nThe conservative government of Malcolm Turnbull has blamed a lack of supply for the problem and is likely to announce some measures in its budget next week.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCapitaLand\u2019s LyndenWoods sells 94% of units on launch day at average S$2,450 psf\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nUK homebuyer demand rebounds to a six-month high, index shows\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5c467f448c3c92e8aa299fc42f4a702b263c70d88cfeba7d6b8bcb9072a4556c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Home price rises slowed sharply in Australia's major cities in April, in a welcome respite for policymakers who have been alarmed at the risks of a debt-fuelled bubble in the housing market."}]}

That was in line with the 507 billion yen average projection by analysts.\n\nSony's return to profitability last seen during the years when it dominated consumer electronics validates chief executive officer Kazuo Hirai's efforts to revamp the company.\n\nSince taking the helm in 2012, he steered the company through years of restructuring and put more focus on gaming, camera chips and finance. With the turnaround now mostly behind him, focus is starting to shift to how Hirai plans to switch from fighting fires to igniting more growth.\n\n\"They are sticking with the mid-term plan that they had provided three years ago - that plan looked impossible back then, but here we are,\" said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group.\n\n\"We think they can hit 600 billion yen, and expect them to revise higher in the second half of the year.\"\n\nLast week, Sony reported estimate-topping preliminary results for the period through March 2017, triggering a share rally. The stock, which has doubled since 2013, is up 15 per cent this year, outperforming the Topix Index.\n\nOperating profit in the fiscal year through March 2017 slipped 1.9 per cent to 288.7 billion yen, while net income halved to 73.3 billion yen as earthquakes in Kyushu a year ago derailed the company's chip and camera businesses. Revenue fell 6.2 per cent to 7.6 trillion yen.\n\nGames were a big boost, with operating profit climbing 53 per cent to 135.6 billion yen. Sony is leaning more than ever on its PlayStation business. Operating profits for the division are expected to climb to 170 billion yen, accounting for about a third of total profit, as the company cashes in on the PlayStation 4's later life-cycle stage, typically the most profitable period for consoles. For the first time, sales from online games, downloads and streaming services exceeded that of hardware sales, Sony said.\n\n\"Having completed a number of re-organisations, we believe that each of our businesses have achieved independence as individual businesses,\" chief financial officer Kenichiro Yoshida said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nOutside of games, Sony is counting on strong growth at its chip division, where operating profit is forecast to climb to 120 billion yen, reversing a loss.\n\nThe company controls half of the market for image sensors, the chips inside phones that convert light particles into digital photos and videos. With more models including the upcoming iPhone expected to adopt multiple sensors to improve image quality, analysts say Sony is well positioned to recover from last year's earthquakes.\n\n\"If you look at near-term, dual-camera sensor usage is ramping up,\" said David Dai, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co.\n\n\"That's really good for Sony.\"\n\nFor now, analysts said Sony will focus on reaching, and possibly exceeding its targets.

That pushed the firm into an annual loss of 40 billion yen for the year ended March 31, 2017. Coming on the heels of record losses by Japanese electrical giant Toshiba, related to the firm's US-based nuclear engineering subsidiary Westinghouse, the Toll losses represent another embarrassing example of poor corporate governance that is damaging to Japan's image, analysts say.\n\nMr Aso has already expressed anger at the way in which the Toshiba affair has threatened to damage Japan's image among international investors. The minister is expected to express dismay also when he meets shortly with Japan Post chief Masatsugu Nagato.\n\nThe planned meeting between Mr Aso and senior Japan Post executives is expected to focus on Japan Post's response to the impairment charge, booked just two years after the acquisition of Toll. The meeting will take place early in May.\n\nJapan Post was widely accused of overpaying significantly when it bought Toll in 2015 just before the then fully state-owned Japan Post had an initial public offering of shares. News of the writedown comes at a sensitive time for Tokyo, which is planning a sale of additional government shares in Japan Post, reports noted.\n\nThe Japanese government, which still controls 80 per cent of Japan Post, hopes to raise about a trillion yen through the sale. The sale is partly aimed at funding the rebuilding of areas hit by Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nNo date has yet been set for the sale of a further tranche of Japan Post shares, but the government has named six investment banks to serve as underwriters to the issue.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/pack-less-carry-more", "site_title": "Pack less, carry more", "publish_date": null, "content": "Pack less, carry more\n\nThese two travel essentials take a sharp - and stylish - departure from the more mundane choices\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Apr 28, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nTravel\n\nFollow\n\nWITH the weather warming up in the Northern Hemisphere, and the school holidays around the corner, many of you are probably either planning or packing for travel or some rest and relaxation.\n\nWith that in mind, this month's Cult Status column brings you two products to help you save space in your carry-on and check-in baggage.\n\nque Bottle\n\nThe first is a product that began as a Kickstarter project. It's a nifty little water bottle with an equally adorable name: the que bottle.\n\nIt comes in two sizes: a larger 600ml bottle (US$25), and a smaller 355ml one (US$20).\n\nI bought two of the smaller size, in Iceberg Blue (a bright sky blue) and Glacier White (a very pale grey). It also comes in Sunbeam Orange, Violet Purple, Metallic Charcoal and Keylime Green.\n\nAs someone who doesn't enjoy lugging around a water bottle (it adds weight and takes up space), I loved the fact that the que bottle can be collapsed to half its size when you've drunk about that much or all of the water in it. It's also very light.\n\nThe concertina design serves another purpose: when you extend the bottle to its full height, the grooves along the exterior of the bottle, along with its rubbery texture, give you plenty of grip.\n\nI bought one of the bottles for my school-going daughter, because it's shatterproof and leakproof. It's made of a rubbery food-grade (BPA/PVC-free) silicone that causes the bottle to simply bounce or roll if dropped on the floor.\n\nThe que bottle also has a stainless steel cap with a leakproof rim, so it doesn't ever end up soaking my daughter's school bag or my purse.\n\nIt can hold hot beverages of up to 60 deg C, as well as cold ones (though it doesn't keep drinks hot or cold). That brings me to another thing I really like about the bottle: its mouth is large enough for ice cubes to easily fit through, making it easy to chill your drink.\n\nThe bottle is also dishwasher-safe, for those of you who have dishwashers. It's also touted to be taste- and odour-free, as well as stain- and bacteria-resistant.\n\nPlus, honestly, isn't it just the cutest-looking thing?\n\nYou can order it off\n\nKickstarter\n\n,\n\nAmazon\n\nor\n\nJoyus\n\n. For Joyus.com, you will need a US credit card and a US postal address; you can also use a mail-forwarding service - such as\n\nHopShopGo\n\n- to purchase products on your behalf.\n\nI bought my bottles from Joyus.com because the site had the best range of colours.\n\neBags Pack-it-Flat Toiletry Kit\n\nFor those of you who struggle to get those typically cuboid-shaped toiletry bags to fit into your luggage (mine literally stick out of my packing like a sore thumb), here's a space-saving alternative: a flat toiletry bag that's just 6cm high.\n\nThe\n\neBags Pack-it-Flat Toiletry Kit\n\n(US$34.99) can simply be tossed on top of my stuff when I'm done; I no longer have to set aside large sections of space in my bag before I start packing.\n\nDespite its compact height, the kit holds quite a lot. It is about 24 cm wide and 38 cm long - with a zippered option on the right that allows you to extend the bag a bit more.\n\nThe left section is lined with PVC film for damp contents.\n\nThe bag really excels with small items, such as travel-sized containers, make-up products and jewellery. Full-sized cosmetic and bath products don't use the space as effectively.\n\nThere are four zippered compartments - one of which holds five pocketed sections for easy sorting, and a removable hanging hook, should you prefer to hang up your toiletry bag (instead of unpacking everything) upon checking in.\n\nThe kit comes in eight colours - so each member of the family can have his own, with the different colours allowing easy identification.\n\nThe kit is available from eBags.com, which ships worldwide. eBags also offers a lifetime warranty for its products.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By that exacting standard, Joe Bastianich - like fellow Italian-American Frank Sinatra - has well and truly got it made. Over the past 25 years, the author, TV host, food entrepreneur, winery owner and - just for good measure - marathon runner, has gone from opening a family-style restaurant with his mother and parlayed it into a food empire spanning various corners of the globe including, among other things, an eclectic group of restaurants (32 and counting).\n\nOf course, it helps that his mother is celebrity chef and cookbook author Lidia Bastianich, the Italian Mama prototype who is also a partner in several of his ventures. Having 'Molto Mario' - American chef-restaurateur Mario Batali - as a long-time business partner doesn't hurt either. Together, they preside over a number of New York City's most popular Italian restaurants, including Babbo, Lupa, Del Posto and more recently, La Sirena.\n\nYet these places pale in comparison to Eataly, a mega food hall concept that is the largest Italian marketplace in the world, originally started in Italy and expanding faster than you can say \"Mama Mia\". Mr Bastianich and Mr Batali have teamed with founder Oscar Farinetti to open a chain of Eatalys in the U.S. and abroad, with more locations on the horizon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This despite a more significant fallback in bond yields.\n\nThis is partly because the geopolitical threats have not proved to be major problems (at least so far) and US President Donald Trump remains focused on his pro-business policy agenda (he has already embarked on deregulation, and his tax reform proposals - while lacking in details - indicate that tax reform remains a key objective). More fundamentally though, markets have been underpinned by an improvement in global growth. This is likely to continue. Numerous indicators point to a stronger global economy.\n\nOf course, there is one qualification to all these positive signs and that is that the US economy looks to have seen a soft start to the year as measured by GDP growth.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nBlackRock hits record US$12.5 trillion in assets amid tariff chaos\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nInvestment myths in a fast-moving stock market\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:06 PM\n\nAll-or-nothing approach to investing has to stop\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:02 PM\n\nShould philanthropists follow Gates\u2019 lead in giving away their fortunes during their lifetimes?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n4\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n5\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/428746a4fa1873bf3ef345c66f1b53963f1b4654f137acdf84dd083a9aebe0cb?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Tourists at Times Square in New York.

Four children (boys ranging from nine months to seven years old) and a considerable supply of nappies later, those original plans have been put on permanent hold and replaced by something completely different.\n\nCall it The Big Squeeze. The requirements of a growing family (Joyce was pregnant with her third son when they decided to rebuild) meant more rooms, but it was difficult to fit everything they wanted into a plot that was just 19 metres long and 8 metres wide. Yet there was no getting away from the fact that the ever-expanding family needed space - and lots of it. So they approached designer Kelvin Bing to come up with a solution.\n\nThe result is a narrow but airy, light-filled three-storey home (plus attic and roof terrace) with - drum roll please - six bedrooms and six bathrooms, spread throughout the residence. The floors are connected via a central cantilevered staircase as well as a small elevator, for use by Dr Loh's parents when they stay over. The senior Lohs' bedroom is on the ground floor next to the dining area, while the three older children share a room on an upper floor.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Variants emerged and mutated over time until a modern version of the saying was popularised by a Victorian-era preacher, according to Gregory Sullivan, a researcher who, like Twain, prefers a pseudonym.\n\nSeven years ago, under the alias Garson O'Toole, Mr Sullivan started Quote Investigator - a popular website where he traces the origins of well-known sayings. This month, also as Mr O'Toole, he published Hemingway Didn't Say That: The Truth Behind Familiar Quotations, a book in which he collected and updated many of the posts from his site and offers new theories on how misquotations form.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n4\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n5\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/40cd61bfd5510281fda2d04826dae73ef8e55921a94d54276c407ebfa2408e3b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The saying \"a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes\" is commonly attributed to Mark Twain (a lookalike, above)."}]}

But it seemed to disappear until 1947, when an Englishwoman, Lucia Bach, revived it. Here, men from the SPCA can be seen catching a stray dog. The organisation was formally established in Orchard Road in 1954 and received its first official vehicle donation. It also hired a telephone operator and a driver. In 1994, the SPCA proposed an increase in penalties for causing harm to animals. Penalties were subsequently increased from a $500 fine and six-month jail term to a $10,000 fine and a one-year jail term. From its humble beginnings with a handful of volunteers, it's now a force to be reckoned with - for those mean to animals, that is.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From a proactive standpoint, Singapore is about as good as it gets,\" said Wayne Allan, vice-president of global manufacturing at Micron, adding the Singapore government's long-term vision was key to Micron expanding its investment.\n\nTaking advantage of government grants, Micron is investing US$4 billion to make more flash-memory chips in Singapore. It increased output by a third in the second half of last year and expects similar growth in the first half of this year.\n\nLinear Technology Corp, a maker of analog integrated circuits, has opened a third chip testing facility in Singapore, and will produce 90 per cent of its global test equipment in the city-state.\n\nAll this has created something of a virtuous circle in the semiconductor supply chain, with chip testing equipment supplier Applied Materials reporting record shipments to Singapore last year, said its regional chief, Russell Tham.\n\nIt's unclear how much of this revival in Singapore's US$40 billion chip industry is due to a so-called ultra-super-cycle in the global memory chip sector, and Singapore remains a smaller player than South Korea and Taiwan.\n\n\"It is vulnerable to a pull-back,\" said Nomura economist Brian Tan.\n\n\"If there's a turnaround in the semiconductor industry... it becomes a lot more apparent that the underlying growth momentum is not great.\"\n\nMOVING UP\n\nHowever, there are real signs that the targeted government incentives are helping firms move up the value chain.\n\nOne of the larger programmes is the Productivity and Innovation Credit, where Singapore has budgeted S$3.6 billion for 2016-18. Another S$400 million automation support package is aimed at small firms, and a S$500 million Future of Manufacturing plan encourages testing new technologies.\n\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry says it encourages manufacturers to \"embrace disruptive technologies\" such as robotics.\n\n\"These measures will help ensure the manufacturing sector in Singapore remains globally competitive,\" it said, attributing the strong semiconductors performance partly to demand from China's smartphone market and improved global semiconductor demand.\n\nFor Feinmetall Singapore, whose products are used for testing semiconductor wafers, grants covered about two thirds of the US$100,000 cost of a needle-bending machine it needed to help overcome an island-wide labour shortage.\n\n\"If we use the same methods as before... I don't think we can expect any growth,\" said Sam Chee Wah, the company's general manager, noting Feinmetall Singapore struggled to retain some workers for much longer than a year, even after nine months of training.\n\nGlobalFoundries Singapore, a wafer maker, has spent US$50 million on 77 robots, each able to perform the tasks of three to four workers. This has helped the company move up the value chain into parts for self-driving cars and security-related chips for credit cards and mobile payments, says general manager KC Ang.\n\nSingapore now has about 400 robots per 10,000 workers, the world's second-highest density after South Korea. Most robots are used in electronics, according to the International Federation of Robots.\n\nAnd further developments are in the pipeline.\n\nAUTOS, IOT\n\nAt its Singapore manufacturing hub, Infineon is developing productivity tools such as robotics and automated guided vehicles which it hopes to deploy to other production sites. Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors is also developing vehicle-to-everything technology, enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and roadside infrastructure.\n\nInstead of trying to compete with high-volume producers such as China or Malaysia, Singapore has shifted to higher-end products, said Jagadish CV, head of Systems on Silicon Manufacturing, another firm making semiconductor wafers.\n\n\"So you do the products which others can't do so easily,\" he said, adding his firm had shifted most of its output to specialised products, such as chips used in smartphones.\n\nCK Tan, President of the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association, noted the global chip industry is automating faster than other sectors because of cost pressure, a need to eliminate or reduce error, and have a consistent process control.\n\n\"In Singapore, it's even more important for us to... look at how to speed up or increase the level of automation because of the lack of skilled resources,\" he said.\n\n\"The industry has recognised it has to move upscale. The government incentives play a part to allow the manufacturing side to be relevant, to be at least cost competitive.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry said first-quarter growth in manufacturing - up 6.6 per cent year-on-year, while overall GDP was up 2.5 per cent - was due mainly to output expansion in electronics and precision engineering.\n\nIntegrated circuits were Singapore's biggest export product among non-oil domestic exports in January-March, topping S$6 billion, according to trade agency IE Singapore.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nBlackRock hits record US$12.5 trillion in assets amid tariff chaos\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nIndia\u2019s cooling inflation prompts rate-cut calls\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nChinese firms rush to buy Nvidia H20 AI chips as sales set to resume\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nSuspended Thai PM asks court for more time to respond to ethics case\n\nJul 15, 2025 04:21 PM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s trade growth target achievable despite US tariffs: minister\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:23 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/13c7cb49fb05b2693d482bbf154576e8c0b2efd740d7cb5248eae9b06b532e68?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Foreign precision engineering firms are investing more in Singapore, drawn by strong semiconductor demand and government incentives aimed at re-tooling an economy short of skilled labour."}]}

There is also the introduction of a segment that is dedicated to restored classics, and a showcase made up entirely of Singapore short films.\n\nOrganised by the Singapore Film Society (SFS) and Singapore University of Social Sciences, the ten-day event opens on Friday with the highly-acclaimed Mad World. The mental illness drama is the debut feature of 28-year-old Hong Kong film-maker Wong Chun, who won the Best New Director prizes at both the Golden Horse and Hong Kong Film Awards this year.\n\nOther first-timers in the line-up include the trio of Frank Hui, Jevons Au and Vicky Wong, whose gangster anthology Trivisa was named Best Picture at the Hong Kong Film Awards; and Zhang Dalei, whose black-and-white coming-of-age drama The Summer is Gone was this year's Golden Horse Best Picture winner.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, we have followed up with a tasting of 20 Sonoma Coast Chardonnays from recent vintages.\n\nIn both tastings, we found wines that combined intensity with balance and subtlety, indicating that the Sonoma Coast is a region of great promise. The region remains difficult for consumers to grasp, partly because it is geographically unwieldy, encompassing a stretch not just along the Pacific coastline but also extending far inland, bringing together wildly different vineyard areas.\n\nThe jumble of regions means that racy wines from the coast and richer, fruitier wines from inland may wear the same appellation. Even among the wines made near the ocean, stylistic differences abound. That's both a problem and an incentive for consumers to get to know the producers and their styles rather than pay strict attention to appellations.\n\nAs far as wines that come from the coastal region, I feel as if we are just beginning to understand its potential. While the region has concentrated on Burgundian varieties such as Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it also produces superb Syrahs and whites from Rhone grapes such as Marsanne and Roussanne.\n\nI've had an intriguing Trousseau, a red mostly associated with the Jura, and a terrific Sonoma Coast Cabernet Sauvignon. But I would not be telling the whole story if I did not add that I have my own emotional reasons for pondering the Sonoma Coast. It may be my favourite area in the world, for reasons that have little to do with wine. My wife, Deborah, and I were married on the Sonoma Coast, at the tiny Sea Ranch Chapel, several miles to the north of the house where Deborah's older brother and sister-in-law had a house for many years.\n\nTheir house, just north of Fort Ross, was a gorgeous, low-slung sprawl that practically hung on the edge of a cliff over the grey Pacific. Deborah and I had been travelling out there for almost as long as the Sonoma Coast has been an American Viticultural Area, as it was declared in 1987.\n\nBack then, most of the grape-growing activity was well inland. Nobody thought much about coastal wines, although a few visionary pioneers, such as David Hirsch at Hirsch Vineyards and Daniel Schoenfeld at Wild Hog Vineyard, had already staked out land precariously close to the ocean. Sadly, this brother-in-law, Peter Henschel, died young, at 53.\n\nWhile we still cherished the house, the region and our many friends in the area, spending time there for me became emotionally complicated. Several years ago, my sister-in-law sold the house. Though there is no longer a Sonoma Coast family outpost, the area continues to resonate with me in unexpected ways, as do the wines.\n\nI mention all this to make the point that wine has an uncanny ability to touch the emotions. Like music, wine can arouse long-buried memories and jolt them awake with all of their baggage: raw, jagged, tender or painful. Marketers know this. They understand the power of establishing direct, personal connections between wine producers and consumers through winery visits, and do what they can to shape lasting associations.\n\nIn a more general way, when I drink a wine that I love from the coast, I imagine I can feel my brother-in-law's presence. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Alex Alan, an owner and wine director at Freek's Mill in Gowanus, Brooklyn, and Kristie Petrullo of Petrullo Wine Co, a wine-education consultancy. We all noted the broad range of styles that included brawny, fruity examples, and leaner wines that showed more savoury, stony flavours - \"sea spray,\" Alex said at one point. The crucial quality that separated my favourites from the also-rans was energy.

At least that's the theory with the territory's pegged currency system.\n\nIt's not always the case. There was a sharp divergence in rates in 2003, when Hong Kong's economy was hit by the impact of the deadly Sars virus, causing a drop in lending that generated a surfeit of liquidity, driving down rates. Local dynamics are causing a gap again, though now it has nothing to do with face masks - it's all about real-estate lending.\n\nIn an effort to cool the world's most expensive property market, authorities late last year imposed tighter restrictions on bank loans and raised the stamp duty. With loans for existing homes harder to get, developers have rushed in to offer financing for new properties, a shift that's put pressure on banks' own lending rates - leaving the interbank Hibor rate drifting below its US equivalent.
