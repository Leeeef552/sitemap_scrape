But he wasn’t a happy puppy.\n\n“Imagine looking into people’s mouths all day long,” he complained to friends.\n\nNever mind that it can be a truly fulfilling profession to all the dedicated dentists who relieve pain, restore the ability to enjoy food or put a smile back on countless faces.\n\nFive years was how long his dentistry career lasted. He is now trading stocks and shares as a remisier. Finally, he is in his element.\n\nAcross the Causeway, there’s Dr Jason Leong. After graduating from University College in Ireland in 2009, he returned to tend to the sickly. But not for long.\n\nIn 2014, he dumped his stethoscope to be… a full-time stand-up comedian.\n\nHis parents would have freaked out, but perhaps it proves that laughter is really the best medicine.\n\nThere are many more people who are unhappy with their career choices.\n\nA 2021 study conducted by The Harris Poll revealed that 47 per cent of those surveyed, aged 33 to 40, wished they had chosen a different career path.\n\nThis lack of fulfilment may stem from their choice of a career that promised financial stability and parental approval, rather than focusing on personal interests and passions.\n\nOn the other hand, leaving it to the child to decide can also backfire. Youngsters can be swayed by factors such as peer pressure.\n\nRavi chose to study IT at a polytechnic because that was what his best friend picked.

The two met online three years ago.\n\nNetizen Naimat Khan tweeted that the pair got married in a court in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Dhir and shared a video of the couple at a tourist spot.\n\nMs Anju reportedly told the court that she had willingly arrived in Pakistan.\n\nIndian media reported that she entered Pakistan through the Attari checkpoint on July 22 and has a visa to remain in Pakistan till Aug 21.\n\nAccording to Upper Dhir District Police Officer Mushtaq Khan, Ms Anju travelled legally to Pakistan and she can request the Pakistan Home Ministry to extend her stay.\n\nMs Anju was born in Kailor village in Uttar Pradesh and moved to Alwar in Rajasthan after marriage.\n\nHer husband Arvind told local media he did not know that she had gone to Pakistan. All Ms Anju told him was that she was going to Jaipur in Rajasthan and would return after a few days.\n\nHer father Gaya Prasad Thomas told reporters at Bouna village in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior district that she has ruined the future of her two children.\n\n“The way she ran away leaving her two children  – a 13-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy – and husband behind... she did not even think of her children. If she wanted to do this, she should have divorced her husband first. She is no more (alive) for us,” he said.\n\nMs Anju’s story has similarities with that of Ms Seema Haider, a Pakistani mother of four, who sneaked into India in May to live with her Indian lover Sachin Meena. The two had met online while playing the video game PUBG in 2019.\n\nAfter her illegal entry into India, the Anti-Terrorist Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police questioned Ms Haider 30, and Mr Meena, 22, and his father Netrapal Singh for two days.\n\nTwo video cassettes, four mobile phones, five “authorised” Pakistani passports, one “unused passport” and an identity card were recovered from her.\n\nLast Friday, Ms Haider filed a mercy petition with India’s President Droupadi Murmu requesting that she, along with her four children, be allowed to stay at her “matrimonial home” in Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida.\n\nIn the petition, Ms Haider said she was in love with Mr Meena and came to India with her four children to live with him.\n\nThe Pakistan citizen claimed she had converted to Hinduism and got married to Mr Meena according to Hindu rites and rituals at the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu, Nepal, in March.\n\nShe told a Hindi news portal: “It hurts when people speak ill of me. No one has said anything good about me.\n\n“I don’t think my four children and I will put any burden on India. If I get citizenship, I will show myself to be a good person.

The record was meticulously verified by Guinness World Records judges.\n\nSatwik has been on a roll over the past month.\n\nHis Korean Open win with Chirag catapulted them to a career-best second spot in the latest Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings. They displaced Chinese duo Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang, whom they defeated in the semi-finals.\n\nThe top spot is held by Indonesians Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto, who lost to Satwik and Chirag in the Korea Open final.\n\nThe wins in South Korea and Indonesia extended Satwik and Chirag’s unbeaten run to 11 matches.\n\nIndia’s top men’s pair have also made a positive start to their campaign at the ongoing Japan Open, beating Indonesia’s Leo Rolly Carnando and Daniel Marthin 21-16, 11-21, 21-13 on Wednesday to move into the second round.\n\nThe third-seeded pair were scheduled to face Denmark’s Jeppe Bay and Lasse Molhede in the second round of the Japan Open on Thursday.\n\nThis year, Satwik and Chirag have demonstrated their prowess with their first title at the Swiss Open, defeating the Chinese pair of Ren Xiangyu and Tan Qiang in the final. They them emerged Asian champions at the Badminton Asia Championships in Dubai.\n\nTheir winning streak continued at the Indonesia Open, where they defeated Malysia’s world No. 4 pair Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik to secure their first BWF World Super 1000 title. The victory also marked them as the first men’s doubles pair from India to win the event.\n\nLast year, Satwik and Chirag started the year by winning the India Open and were part of India’s Thomas Cup-winning team.\n\nThey lost the first game to Indonesia’s Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo and Mohammad Ahsan but won the second game and closed out the third game, giving India a 2-0 lead over Indonesia. This was pivotal in helping India bag its maiden Thomas Cup trophy.\n\nSatwik and Chirag’s achievements are testament to their dedication, hard work and talent, noted India Today.\n\nTheir rise to world No.2 is a significant milestone in Indian badminton history, inspiring many young athletes in the country.\n\nBut their journey is far from over, with many expecting them to bag the world No. 1 ranking soon.\n\nThe ongoing Japan Open provides the first opportunity for the Indian shuttlers to move to No. 1, reported Sportstar. The pair must win the tournament and or finish as runners-up if the top-seeded Indonesians are eliminated in the Round of 16.\n\nThere are multiple BWF tournaments scheduled for the rest of the year after the Japan Open, with the China Open and BWF Tour Finals offering the most ranking points.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4bc47e5789525dbe4aabd79f9eef4609e71690e3510b3cd89b5e3953e2549493?w=825", "alt_text": ""}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA sex scene with a line from the Bhagvad Gita in nuclear arms biopic Oppenheimer has drawn ire in India, with netizens saying they would boycott the movie because of what one nationalist group called a “scathing attack on Hinduism”.\n\nThe scene features Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer reciting a verse from the Gita – considered the holiest of Hindu scriptures – just before he has sex with his lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh.\n\nTatlock stops during intercourse and picks up a copy of the Gita and asks Oppenheimer to read from it.\n\n“Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” Oppenheimer says, as they resume intercourse.\n\nThe scene has caused outrage among some right-wing groups, with a politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party calling the film a “disturbing attack on Hinduism” and accusing it of being “part of a larger conspiracy by anti-Hindu forces”.\n\nIndia’s Information Commissioner Uday Mahurkar issued a statement saying the scene was “a direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus”, likening it to “waging a war on the Hindu community”.\n\nThe film, which was released in India on Friday with much fanfare, was rated by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) as U/A, which recommends parental guidance for viewers younger than 12.\n\n“This should be investigated... on an urgent basis and those involved should be severely punished,” the nationalist Save Culture Save India Foundation said in a press release.\n\nProminent right-wing Hindu organisation Vishva Hindu Parishad said the movie was an attempt to “launch an attack” on Hindu society and demanded the scene be cut.\n\n“The makers should apologise to the Hindu community all over the world, whose sentiments have been badly hurt,” spokesman Vinod Bansal told AFP.\n\nComments by Mr Mahurkar condemning the movie were retweeted more than 4,000 times.\n\n“We believe that if you remove this scene and do the needful to win the hearts of Hindus, it will go a long way to establish your credentials as a sensitised human being and give you the friendship of billions of nice people,” he said.\n\nAccording to the Hindustan Times, India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur has demanded absolute accountability from the CBFC and directed the filmmakers to promptly remove the controversial scene.\n\nHe also warned that stringent action would be taken against all CBFC members involved in approving the screening of the movie.\n\nUniversal Pictures India, the local unit of the film’s producers, and CBFC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe movie, directed by Christopher Nolan, stars Murphy as the United States physicist who oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nAhead of the film’s release, Murphy said he had read the Bhagvad Gita in preparation.\n\n“I thought it was an absolutely beautiful text, very inspiring. I think it was a consolation to him (Oppenheimer), he kind of needed it, and it provided him a lot of consolation, all his life,” he told Indian film critic Sucharita Tyagi.\n\nOppenheimer was drawn to Hinduism and its teachings. A polyglot and polymath, he taught himself multiple languages including Sanskrit.\n\nSpeaking to interviewers two decades after the world’s first nuclear explosion took place on July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer said: “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.” He then recalled the line from Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe line is used in the film multiple times, including during the sex scene.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5c9d3f7690ddb68e90285711fd3f62e5d9df81e61af66f296ae5b4af00702a2d?w=825", "alt_text": "Oppenheimer stars Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/658dd0a9f26d771a633fc82188f09d4deb4e4136785ae751efc0e46d9fff30ec?w=825", "alt_text": "Oppenheimer stars Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5c9d3f7690ddb68e90285711fd3f62e5d9df81e61af66f296ae5b4af00702a2d?w=825", "alt_text": "Oppenheimer stars Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/658dd0a9f26d771a633fc82188f09d4deb4e4136785ae751efc0e46d9fff30ec?w=825", "alt_text": "Oppenheimer stars Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5c9d3f7690ddb68e90285711fd3f62e5d9df81e61af66f296ae5b4af00702a2d?w=825", "alt_text": "Oppenheimer stars Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSergeant (APF) Uvarajah Krishnasamy has handled several difficult situations during his 16-year career with Certis.\n\nBut the one the traffic marshal was confronted with on the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) earlier this month will always remain etched in his memory.\n\nOn July 8, at about 4pm, the 39-year-old received a call from his colleague that a horse was galloping along the BKE. He initially thought it was a joke, but soon found out that it was indeed true.\n\nVideos of the brown horse weaving through the traffic had gone viral.\n\nSgt Uvarajah immediately headed to the place where the horse was last seen.\n\nThe animal lover has four pet dogs back home in Malaysia. But the last time he saw a horse was a few years ago, when he was holidaying in India.\n\n“I was shocked and trembling when I saw the horse. It was so enormous,” Sgt (PFA) Uvarajah told\n\ntabla!\n\n.\n\nBefore reaching the Turf Club Avenue exit on the expressway, he switched off the siren on his motorbike so as to not startle the horse. Making sure that the traffic was not disrupted, he tried to control the horse with his hands but failed.\n\nHe then decided to overtake the horse and block it with his motorbike. The horse appeared agitated at his move and Sergeant Uvarajah was fearful that it might kick out.\n\nBut he summoned all his courage and patted the horse’s head. Soon the horse lowered its head.\n\nSensing the opportunity, Sgt Uvarajah grabbed the horse’s rein and walked the horse to the Singapore Turf Club while directing the traffic away from the animal.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, he returned the horse – which belonged to Bukit Timah Saddle Club – to its stable.\n\nAccording to the Singapore Turf Club horse handler who took over, the horse was new and was practising with a new trainer when it panicked and ran out.\n\n“Maybe my uniform looked like that of a jockey, and was familiar to him,” said Sgt Uvarajah. “To keep myself safe, I held on to the horse’s lead and walked in front of it as I guided it away from the road. The most challenging thing was having to handle the horse while directing traffic away at the same time.”\n\nSgt Uvarajah, who hails from Malacca, had handled only small animals, such as cats and dogs. He was thankful that although many people on the road took photos and videos of him tackling the horse, none honked and alarmed the animal.\n\n“My wife was stunned when I told her what happened,” he said. “My two sons love animals, so they were thrilled when they heard about the incident.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/74a4c827e3fae3699815509b92a75590d07aab0e2758cb60a421e8f8a6b48ab3?w=825", "alt_text": "Sergeant (APF) Uvarajah Krishnasamy with the runaway horse"}]}

It comes down to character, comes down to being independent-minded,” he said.\n\nAs with Mr Ong, Mr Tharman said he is advantaged to have been in politics, as he became experienced in working on policies, understood the complexities of running government, and played an international role for Singapore.\n\nMr Tharman emphasised that besides his expertise and experience, he brings integrity and independence of mind that he is known for, both within and outside of the Government.

Santosh Kumar\n\nEvery Singaporean should develop a deeper understanding of the cultural elements of other races and actively participate in them – that is the next step for the country’s development, said former Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam last Friday.\n\nHe was speaking at an event organised by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry(SCCCI), Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry to mark Racial Harmony Day.\n\n“Racial Harmony is our foundation, tolerance is one of our national identities”, he said.\n\nMr Tharman, who welcomed the guests in Singapore’s four official languages, added: “Everyone should come forward to learn the various traditional elements of other races including art, dance, music and language. Through this, we can build on the legacy of all the races, which has a strong historical footprint of over 1,000 years.”\n\nThe presidential hopeful said Singapore’s multiracial society is based on two spaces: unique cultures and languages, which give people a sense of emotional identification, and the compromises each community makes.\n\nHowever, he added, there is also a need for a third area where Singaporeans need to participate in one another’s culture for deeper understanding.\n\n“This does not mean a fusion of all the cultures. The basic traditions of our races should not change, yet we should strive to expand their boundaries and rise,” he said.\n\nMr Tharman added that it is the duty of each Singaporean to sustainably hand over the heritage of our races to the next generation to sustain the identity of Singapore.\n\n“We should encourage our children to be friendly with children of other races and only that will give us confidence to face the challenging future,” he said.\n\nThe event, with the theme “Embracing and Harnessing Multi-Racialism to Drive Business Growth”, had speeches and panel discussions that reflected on the significance of social harmony and preserving the spirit of multiracialism.\n\nMore than 250 people, from youth to entrepreneurs, participated in the event held at the SCCCI building.\n\n“Racial Harmony is our foundation, tolerance is one of our national identities.”\n\nFormer Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1e49419a0c26e6da68e8f96ee76af4ef1538c9337213d1656144e13ef03d4752?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam speaking at the Racial harmony Day event."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFormer Indian High Commissioner Periasamy Kumaran has said his three years in Singapore was “reasonably productive” despite the “difficult circumstances” he found himself in on his arrival in July 2020.\n\n“The situation then was very difficult, with Covid-19 raging and vaccines still undeveloped. It was difficult to go out and meet people,” he told\n\ntabla!\n\n, adding that he estimated the number of Indians and Indian Singaporeans here to be about 700,000.\n\n“I wanted to meet as many of them as possible to build a rapport for the next three years but I couldn’t.”\n\nThe situation was made worse by incidents such as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claiming that a “very dangerous” Covid-19 strain was prevalent in Singapore and a Changi airport Covid-19 cluster wrongly attributed to a family that arrived from India.\n\n“Those incidents were only small niggles in the India-Singapore relationship,” said Mr Kumaran, who left Singapore last Saturday to take up the post of secretary at the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi.\n\n“What was more troublesome during the pandemic was the restricted movements. One of the greatest attractions for the Indian community is the short distance between India and Singapore and the excellent connectivity. Once you remove that from the equation, Singapore becomes less attractive.”\n\nMr Kumaran is glad that passenger loads have returned to pre-Covid levels and 16 Indian cities are connected to Singapore by air.\n\nHe recalled how ministerial visits were few and far between during the first-half of his tenure. “But the situation changed after the first visit by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in September 2021,” he said.\n\n“We’ve had several ministerial visits since then, including Chief Minister M.K. Stalin coming from Tamil Nadu recently.”\n\nMr Kumaran, a 1992-batch Indian Foreign Service officer, described the India-Singapore ministerial roundtable in September 2022 as a memorable milestone in which both sides identified growth engines such as digitalisation and trade facilitation.\n\n“Digitalisation is the first pillar – connecting payment systems and facilitating data transfer are among the areas we are working on.\n\n“The second is green economy, which is very promising with commitments by both sides. India is a big source of green energy and we are looking to connect the grids directly between India and Singapore, as well as with Asean.\n\n“We also have green hydrogen and ammonia supply chains. There is a pilot project whose success will mean we can scale up in a big way, procuring green hydrogen and using it in Singapore.”\n\nThe third pillar is skills development, which is an area of interest to India.\n\n“Singapore has been extremely successful in setting up an ecosystem for skills development. It is remarkable how the syllabus is constantly improved to deal with new technologies,” said Mr Kumaran.\n\n“India has a young population and we need to train them, help them get jobs, optimise our skills development ecosystem. Singapore is a very good partner for that.”\n\nFood security, the fourth pillar under the ministerial roundtable, is of interest to Singapore and India, which is one of the largest food producers in the world, said Mr Kumaran.\n\n“During the pandemic, some countries closed their agricultural exports for fear of internal shortages but India kept the supply lines open because the fear of Covid-19 spreading in villages was far lower.\n\n“So Singapore thinks it will be good to have a food security partnership or a food corridor to try and work with India. But how we are going to lay the plan for the food corridor is still being worked on.”\n\nCollaboration between India and Singapore will continue in “standard areas”, such as urban solutions, smart cities, waste management and fintech. “There is talk about how we can develop new industrial parks in India. The Tamil Nadu government has already signed an agreement to help redevelop industrial parks and it wants them to be redeveloped vertically, like Singapore does.”\n\nWith regard to the locals fearing job loss due to more work permits being issued for Indians to work in Singapore, Mr Kumaran stressed that “we should be sensitive to local sentiments”.\n\nHe explained: “At the top end of the job market, where there is a need for world-class talent, Singapore will continue to be an open place. At the lower end, many jobs do not pay well enough for Singaporeans, so that is not an area of contest. It’s only the middle segment, with both Singaporeans and Indians vying for the jobs.\n\n“You can’t help but admire the way things are so well-organised here. Singapore also has one of the best Indian diasporas in the world – extremely well-qualified, well-to-do and successful.\n\n“When you go to a high-level discussion, the quality they bring to the table is exceptional. With about 5,000 Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management graduates, Singapore might have the highest concentration of high-value professionals in the world.”\n\nMr Kumaran also found Singapore’s connectivity with the region “very exciting”. “Unfortunately, my family (wife Ritu and sons Aditya and Mayank) and I could not travel much because of the pandemic and the second-half of my tenure was busy.”\n\n“We have made many new friends over the last three years and we plan to keep in touch with them. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Singapore,” he added.\n\nIndia’s new High Commissioner, Dr Shilpak Ambule, presented his credential to President Halimah Yacob on Tuesday.\n\n“It is going to be an exciting time as we have a new high commissioner who’s so close to Foreign Minister Jaishankar,” said Mr Kumaran.\n\n“Dr Ambule is from the 2002 IFS batch and has done postings in China and Sri Lanka. He is one of the best Chinese speakers in the foreign ministry and has been Dr Jaishankar’s staff officer when Dr Jaishankar was ambassador in Beijing, later as foreign secretary and now as foreign minister. They have worked together for about 10 years.”\n\n“You can’t help but admire the way things are so well-organised here. Singapore also has one of the best Indian diasporas in the world – extremely well-qualified, well-to-do and successful.”\n\nFormer Indian High Commissioner Periasamy Kumaran", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/031a5f10beb27c35ed1312dfd7512991fabd83d58c9339c1e8402c47bccb44ac?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2df9905bcf418de719f8fa04f05c4329d818d11d254026b743b839541baaacf1?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5cf13343698ad642649843e71de2fa543c506b9588042872e054b31ef89e19ae?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/031a5f10beb27c35ed1312dfd7512991fabd83d58c9339c1e8402c47bccb44ac?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2df9905bcf418de719f8fa04f05c4329d818d11d254026b743b839541baaacf1?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5cf13343698ad642649843e71de2fa543c506b9588042872e054b31ef89e19ae?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/031a5f10beb27c35ed1312dfd7512991fabd83d58c9339c1e8402c47bccb44ac?w=825", "alt_text": "kumaran28\nCaption: Indian High Commissioner at an event in Singapore.\nCredit: Periasamy Kumaran/Facebook"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI) has stirred up controversy with its new set of guidelines for the Tamil film industry: only Tamil artists can be engaged in Tamil films.\n\nThe hiring guideline and a rule that limits filming to within Tamil Nadu were part of a move to ensure FEFSI members remain employable, Manorama Online reported. There are fears in the industry that outsiders are taking away their jobs.\n\nHeaded by director and producer R.K. Selvamani, FEFSI is a network of 23 unions spanning the different trades in the Tamil film and television industry and boasting 25,000 members.\n\nThe federation forbids Tamil films from being shot in other states and foreign countries unless absolutely necessary. And shoots that cannot meet the deadline or keep to the budget have to be explained in writing to the producers.\n\nDisciplinary action will be taken if the rules are violated, warned FEFSI. It claimed that its members could not get jobs because Tamil films were made with actors from other industries and filming in foreign locations deprives local technicians of employment opportunities.\n\nTamil cinema is one of India’s largest and most diverse film industries, attracting artists from across India.\n\nMalayali and Telugu actors, in particular, have played a significant role in Tamil cinema. Fahad Faasil is one such non-Tamil actor who has left a mark in the Tamil industry, especially with Vikram in 2022.\n\nBig-budget and star-led Tamil films often explore foreign locations for their visual appeal and storytelling.\n\nThe controversy surrounding FEFSI’s decision underscores the complexity of balancing regional representation with artistic freedom and creativity in the vibrant world of Tamil cinema.\n\nIndian cinema is increasingly witnessing cross-collaborations among film industries of different languages, so this move by FEFSI has attracted criticism and debates online.\n\nWhile most big names in Tamil cinema have preferred to remain silent on the new FEFSI guidelines, Malayalam filmmaker Vinayan openly slammed the decision.\n\nHe posted on Facebook the possibility of the Tamil film industry losing at least Rs150 crore ($24 million) should Kerala counter the restrictions by banning Tamil films in its cinemas.\n\n“While we see India as a single nation, Tamil Nadu film associations are headed in a different direction,” he wrote.\n\n“It is a highly localised decision in a place where it is believed that all Indians are brothers and sisters. This news has been out for a while but we have not seen the Tamil Nadu government opposing the decision.”\n\nVinayan added that the “separatist” move should not be allowed to grow and that no one should curb Indian artists from working in any state and language.\n\n“My opinion is that the producers, theatre owners and distributors of Malayalam cinema should be ready as soon as possible to give a strong reply,” he said.\n\nVinayan, who directed Tamil films such as Naalai Namadhe, En Mana Vaanil and Kasi, said he loves Tamil films and Tamil Nadu but “cannot agree with the narrow mentality”.\n\nIn the wake of similar negative comments online, FEFSI general secretary B.N. Swaminathan came out to say that the organisation was merely safeguarding the interest of thousands of workers in the Tamil film industry.\n\n“We can’t ban actors from working in Tamil films since our organisation has no such powers,” he told Deccan Herald.\n\n“We have not imposed any restrictions on even chief technicians from other states working in the Tamil film industry.\n\n“Our dancers and fighters are working in Telugu films under 50 per cent terms and they can also come here on similar terms.\n\n“This time, it was only about daily-wage workers and nothing more.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“While we see India as a single nation, Tamil Nadu film associations are headed in a different direction.

Santosh Kumar\n\nNext Monday, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (left) will become a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP). And he believes that, with this appointment, the onus will be on him to air the concerns of the business fraternity in Singapore.\n\nThe Pegasus Asia CEO and chairman of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: “Trade Associations and Chambers represent many small and medium enterprises in Singapore and voicing their concerns will be my priority as we push businesses to go green, global and digital.\n\n“As we have a small domestic economy, we need to facilitate the international expansion of our companies to scale globally.”\n\nMr Parekh is also board director of Elevandi, set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to foster an open dialogue between the public and private sectors to advance fintech in the digital economy.\n\nHe is among nine new NMPs whose names were announced in Parliament on Monday. The other new NMPS are Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Associate Professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi.\n\nThey will be appointed for a 30-month term by President Halimah Yacob on July 24 and sworn in when Parliament sits in August.\n\nMs Ranee is the daughter of Mr. S. Chandra Das, former Member of Parliament and chairman of Tamil Murasu newspaper. She completed her Bachelor of Law in 2002 and Master of Professional Accounting in 2009. She also obtained an MA in Asian Art Histories from Goldsmith’s, University of London, in 2017.\n\nThe 42-year-old is a Plural Art Mag co-founder and course coordinator at Nanyang Technological University’s Nanyang Business School. She has been associated with the arts industry for more than seven years.\n\nMs Ranee said: “My focus will be to ensure the stability of the Singapore arts industry and take the industry forward. In order for arts to thrive, there is a need for arts entities and artists to understand how to monetise their assets and protect their legal rights.\n\n“While the Arts Resource Hub has done a good job in raising awareness on these issues, we can do more to educate artists on legal and practical issues that are pertinent to arts businesses.\n\n“Arts and cultural workers should be fully supported for the sector to truly thrive. As many arts workers are freelancers, more can be done to educate the community on its rights and obligations in the gig economy and strategies for better mental and physical wellness.”\n\nMs Ranee, who said she is very proud of her Indian heritage, added that she felt “honoured and humbled by the NMP appointment”.\n\n“The multitude of Indian arts groups in Singapore are well-known not just among the Indian community but also the wider population. I will focus on championing art among the youth as the sector has to grow strong roots in Singapore.”\n\nMr Thomas, who is president of the Security Association Singapore and a partner at law firm Wee Swee Teow, will be appointed for a second term.\n\n“I will continue to speak up for low-wage workers and focus on raising the value of these types of jobs among youngsters,” said the 43-year-old who is a volunteer lawyer with Law Society’s Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.\n\nThe tenure of the current appointed Members of Parliament ends on July 20.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/83e6a563a079c6e5516dd958c7a8c0034de683175b4e4a74f3a598f1d1b94185?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3f05c3318301d73d51e16d8e04cc1cfcedcdb8094e942c4a1b8533f759468eec?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/48705a33bc219339cae8f7b15f76677268d55b520a2349e157cb94c36d4121bd?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/83e6a563a079c6e5516dd958c7a8c0034de683175b4e4a74f3a598f1d1b94185?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3f05c3318301d73d51e16d8e04cc1cfcedcdb8094e942c4a1b8533f759468eec?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/48705a33bc219339cae8f7b15f76677268d55b520a2349e157cb94c36d4121bd?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/83e6a563a079c6e5516dd958c7a8c0034de683175b4e4a74f3a598f1d1b94185?w=825", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from top left) Ms Chandradas Usha Ranee, Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua Tiang Choon, Mr Parekh Nimil Rajnikant, associate professor Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim, Mr Ong Hua Han, Ms See Jinli, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingapore’s sprint queen Shanti Pereira considers her performance at last week’s Asian Athletics Championships “pretty incredible”.\n\nThe 26-year-old cemented her reputation as one of Asia’s top sprinters in Bangkok with a double gold.\n\nHer time of 11.20sec in the 100m was a new national record – the sixth time she smashed the mark this year.  And her win in the 200m in 22.70sec was a meet record – just 0.01sec shy of equaling her own national record.\n\n“My achievement still hasn’t really sunk in,” she told Tabla on Tuesday.\n\n“My coach (Portuguese Luis Cunha) and I made history. I’m the first Singaporean to win two events in the same competition.\n\n“I didn’t really expect that because it is such a high-level competition. I was just talking to my sister today and both of us can’t really believe what happened.\n\n“It’s an amazing feeling and gives me the motivation to do well the rest of the year.”\n\nPereira has been in blistering form this year – seemingly able to win races at will. She rewrote her own 100m national record in her first race of the year at the New Zealand Track and Field Championships in Wellington in March. Her time of 11.46sec eclipsed her previous national mark by 0.02sec.\n\nAt the Australia Open Track and Field Championships in Brisbane, she broke her national records three times in three days. She clocked 11.38sec on Mar 31 to eclipse her own 100m national mark by 0.08sec and won the final a day later, shaving off 0.01sec. The next day, she timed 22.89sec in the 200m heat to set another national record.\n\nIn May’s SEA Games in Phnom Penh, Pereira became the first Singaporean woman to win both the 100m and 200m at the same edition of the Games. She won the 200m in 22.69sec, setting a new national and SEA Games record, eclipsing the 23.01sec set by the Philippines’ Kristina Knott in 2019.\n\nPereira regained some form last year after she won the 200m gold and 100m silver at the Hanoi SEA Games. But this year has been a grand recovery after she suffered several lows over seven years – early competition losses, niggling injuries and lack of a proper coach due to infighting and politicking in Singapore Athletics.\n\nWhat has changed for her is that she started training full-time in January. The accounting degree holder used to work with social media content provider DC Creative from early 2022 and it affected her training pattern to some extent.\n\n“When I started to train full-time, it also changed my mindset. In a way, I’m just focusing on myself now. I’m focusing on the process goals and doing the best that I can to be ready for big competitions,” she said.\n\n“I’ve always believed that athletics is what I’m meant to do, so even though I was going through the low points of my career, I didn’t give up. I just pushed on and continued to work hard and train hard to keep up my performance.\n\n“But what has happened this year is definitely something I did not expect, especially at the start of the year. I started to make a lot of breakthroughs and I hope to continue on that path for the rest of the year.”\n\nAnother aspect that has worked for Pereira is understanding her perspective of her athletics career.\n\n“I no longer worry about what others think of me or say about me. I just think about myself and what I am capable of,” she said.\n\n“I have also changed my lifestyle to be more athletics-centric because that’s what my coach has been trying to instill in me. Every decision I make is to contribute to my overall performance as an athlete, not just the competitions. This means having the discipline to watch my diet and make sure I get enough sleep because sleep is the most important form of recovery which will then contribute to my performance.”\n\nPereira has tweaked her running style and technique only slightly. “In terms of my technique, the changes have been very small, such as how I move, where my foot lands, things like that,” she said.\n\n“I leave it to my coach to design my training programme. He has a yearly plan for the different competitions, like focusing on the certain areas that I need to improve on.”\n\nPereira will train and compete in Berlin and Copenhagen ahead of the Aug 19-27 World Athletics Championships in Budapest.\n\nThe next major competition for her will be the Sept 23-Oct 8 Hangzhou Asian Games.\n\n“Let’s see what happens in Hangzhou. Hopefully I will clock better timings. Right now, I am just enjoying the process.”\n\nPereira admitted there were “still a lot of things that I need to improve on”.\n\n“There are many, many rounds till the final, so I have to be mentally prepared. There are a lot of places in my technique that I can work on,” she explained.\n\n“In the 200m, for instance, I tend to get a bit tired towards the end of the race. My legs are a bit more tired. So it’s important to maintain proper technique to prevent injuries and ultimately run faster even though your body is tired.”\n\nPereira believes that training and competing in Europe are best for her before World Championships.  “I’ll be up against the best in the world, so I will know what it feels like when I’m thrown into a big competition. And I’ll be prepared for it.”\n\nWith the full support of her family, boyfriend –  former 400m runner and lawyer Tan Zong Yan, 28 – and coach, Pereira is confident she can continue to shine in major competitions this year.\n\n“My boyfriend knows what it takes to be an athlete,” she said. “He supports me in whatever way he can. My family is very supportive of my journey. If they get the chance, my parents will fly over to watch me run.\n\n“But my coach has been the key person in my career. I owe a lot of my success to him.”\n\n“I no longer worry about what others think of me or say about me. I just think about myself and what I am capable of.”\n\nNational sprinter Shanti Pereira", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a0a0d3eb5de6fe1cd9a370a5adf0aeca2977bc6dacb057d2b791bfcb17d0a752?w=825", "alt_text": "Shanti Pereira wins the 200m for double gold at Asian championships."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIf you had asked coach Luis Cunha at the beginning of this year whether Shanti Pereira would break many records and become the fastest woman in Asia, the answer would have been a firm “no”.\n\n“I always knew she could win big but there were problems hindering her,” the former Portuguese sprinter and three-time Olympian told tabla!.\n\n“But for the first time – before the Asian Athletics Championships in Bangkok last week – I was expecting something big. She had high chances of winning both the races.\n\n“I expected her to win the 200m. But it was her eighth race and I didn’t know if she could recover in time. Shanti proved that she could do it, and I am so happy.”\n\nAccording to Cunha, “a bunch of little things” helped Pereira hit top form.\n\n“The important thing is that her mindset has changed. She has shed some of her ‘bad’ habits. She has identified what needs to be done to perform better. She has better routines now. She understands that she has to be an athlete 24/7.”\n\nCunha added that more than any major change to her technique, it was important to make Pereira mentally stronger.\n\n“Train, compete, recover – that has been the philosophy. Before a major competition like SEA Games, she trained and competed in New Zealand and Australia, and that produced results,” he explained.\n\n“The same will happen before the World Athletics Championships next month and the Asian Games in September.\n\n“Competing against the best in the world in European competitions can help her. It is a completely different level from what she faces at home and in Asia.”\n\nA few years ago, Cunha would have felt that there was no point in Pereira competing in the World Athletics Championships. “But this time is different, she can use the event to build her confidence as it is a totally different level,” he said.\n\nThe coach is confident that Pereira can do well at the Asian Games.\n\n“The training will be the same but it is very important that she remains free of injuries,” he said.\n\n“If she maintains her health, she will continue to do well.”\n\nV.K.

Santosh Kumar\n\nEmployees’ worst nightmare of being replaced by artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived much sooner than expected.\n\nDukaan CEO Suumit Shah is under attack online after he announced on Twitter that he replaced 90 per cent of his customer support team with an AI chatbot.\n\nDukaan is a Bengaluru-based e-commerce startup that helps businesses set up their online shopfronts.\n\nMr Shah revealed on July 11 that he decided to prioritise prompt customer service and profitability over everything else, reported the Economic Times. He wrote that the use of AI tools reduced wait time from 1 min, 44sec to instantaneous and customer support costs by 85 per cent.\n\n“We had to lay off 90 per cent of our support team because of this AI chatbot. Tough? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely,” tweeted the 31-year-old who also mentioned how his team developed an AI chatbot named Lina, which generated instant answers to customer queries and customised answers for clients.\n\nIn one sweep, he claimed,  Dukaan was able to remove communication bottlenecks such as delayed, generic responses, and cut down costs. “About 200 live chats and 1,400 support tickets have been marked as resolved by Lina,” he said.\n\nMr Shah told Insider the the layoffs occurred last September and resulted in Duukan  — which currently employs 60 people — letting go of 23 of the 26 members of its customer support team.  He said his “monthly budget” for customer support is now only US$100 ($132).\n\nThe tweet amassed two million views and more than 2,500 likes within two days. But it also triggered outrage across the Internet.\n\nNetizens felt that Mr Shah was using AI as a smokescreen to hide shortcomings like poor performance and lack of funding.\n\n“Note to all young, starry-eyed, startup folk. Make no mistake. The support team was laid off here because business is failing and funding is dry. Not because of AI,” netizen Adityarao tweeted.\n\nAnother netizen wrote: “Why are some Indian tech founders so heartless and insensitive to human impact? An employee is not just a machine to fulfil objectives and key results. Disgusting.”\n\nOn LinkedIn, a humour page called Corporate Bhakt shared the news of the layoff. Some LinkedIn users joked that CEOs may also be replaced by AI while others pointed out that the human element of customer service can never be replaced completely by AI.\n\n“I’m in the customer support industry for eight years and trust me, no AI can replace a human in customer-handling. Wonder if Dukaan go down soon,” commented a LinkedIn user.\n\nResponding to the online backlash, Mr Shah told Insider that he regretted kicking off a conversation about layoffs on Twitter but was adamant that his point still stands. “AI is taking our jobs. Over time, everybody will start doing this. It’s not just us. Maybe I’m just too straightforward to have put it on Twitter.”\n\nDukaan is not the first company to announce layoffs as a result of AI – a trend which is likely to continue, according to a May report by human resources firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas.\n\nIn May, Insider reported similar outrage when the US National Eating Disorder Association laid off its entire helpline staff and replaced them with a chatbot. Soon after, the chatbot was disabled for giving out harmful information on eating disorders.\n\nIn March, Goldman Sachs published a report showing that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. In India, several firms are investing into AI to develop products, and it has sparked concerns about job losses.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cfb304cee44c55a0905b8e6cfd303e56caf1e2358645d107bcca9c6e9257499d?w=825", "alt_text": "Dukaan chief executive Suumit Shah was criticised on social media and described as lacking empathy."}]}

KARTHIKEYAN\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nHundreds of foreign domestic workers flocked to the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple last Sunday morning to grab free saris offered by the Hindu Centre.\n\nThe independent, non-governmental organisation, dedicated to the spiritual progress of Hindus in Singapore through education, devotion and service, decided to give out the preloved but in good condition saris, after a collection drive in April proved successful.\n\nMembers of the public could also buy the saris at prices ranging from $5 to $30. The sales proceeds went to the Hindu Centre.\n\nThe sari giveaway was initiated by National University of Singapore instructor Uma Jayaraman, who has been volunteering with Hindu Centre for more than 20 years. She wanted to give back to the foreign domestic workers in Singapore and a new sari is something they might not afford but would like to have.\n\n“The sari is usually kept in the wardrobe after it is worn a few times,” said Hindu Centre president N. Varaprasad.\n\n“Women crave saris but soon get bored with the design. We felt that instead of discarding the sari, they should be given away as a form of charity.”\n\nFollowing an announcement on social media by the Hindu Centre, about 6,000 saris were collected through public donations over three weeks. The saris were then sorted by their designs and transported to the venue by Hindu Centre volunteers.\n\nAlthough the giveaway was supposed to go on till 8pm, most of the saris were gone by 11.30am.\n\nMs Kannaiyan Meenatchi, a domestic helper from Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, who has been in Singapore for 15 years, said it was her first time at such an event.\n\n“I don’t usually wear saris in Singapore because of my work conditions,” she said.\n\n“I wear them only on special occasions. I plan to give my mother and relatives the saris I picked up. This event is a blessing to me because usually I cannot afford to buy more than one sari, which costs a fortune.”\n\nMs Indira, a domestic worker from Darjeeling in north-east India, was at the giveaway with two friends. She said: “Events like this should be organised more often so that the helpers can feel connected to the larger community.”\n\nHindu Centre volunteer and financial journalist S. Anuradha pointed out that “organising the event was important because it means we are also practising the three Rs of recycling (reduce, reuse, recycle).\n\n“People have to realise that the clothes or products that they buy will go to waste if they are not used for a long time. Giving it away to people in need is always a better idea.”\n\n“The sari is usually kept in the wardrobe after it is worn a few times. Women crave saris but soon get bored with the design.

It was absolutely incredible. It blew me away,” he said.\n\n“There are a lot of similarities between Barbie and Bollywood. There’s the focus on music. There are songs, singing and dancing.

Santosh Kumar\n\nRegular customers of this Indian stall in Commonwealth will have to find their favourite dishes elsewhere when it closes at the end of this month.\n\nMrs Vasanthi Sutharsan, 61, has been running The Best Indian Food at Commonwealth Crescent Market and Food Centre with her husband and two daughters for eight years.\n\nBut she is suffering from high blood pressure and other health complications. She nearly fainted recently while cooking.\n\nHer husband Sutharsan, who has been battling diabetes for years and had his leg amputated recently, now requires full-time care.\n\nSo daughters Chandralega and Durgadevi decided it was best to close the stall and focus on the well-being of their parents. They are now looking to hire a helper to aid in the caregiving responsibilities.\n\nMrs Vasanthi, who has been in the food industry for more than 25 years, wakes up at 3am every day to prepare the batter for thosai and vadai, and grind the chutneys.\n\nAt 5am, she makes her way to the stall across from the flat to start frying vadais and prepping for the day. By 7am, residents gather at the stall to grab fresh thosai and vadai.\n\n“We have customers coming not just from Commonwealth but also from Bukit Batok and even Woodlands,” she said.\n\n“The customers, especially Chinese and Indian immigrants, love my food as it gives them the comfort of home-cooked food.”\n\nMrs Vasanthi came to Singapore from Thiruvarur – a town in Tamil Nadu – when she was 22 years old, after getting married to Mr Sutharsan. She taught herself to cook and started to work in food stalls as a dishwasher.\n\nHer passion for cooking and serving people home-cooked food, coupled with the encouragement and support from her family, motivated her to open her own stall at Telok Blangah Heights Wet Market and Food Centre.\n\nShe then moved to Stirling Road for about 11 years before moving to Commonwealth Crescent.\n\nMrs Vasanthi named the stall The Best Indian Food after she received raving reviews from her customers. The food gets sold out by 3pm and Mrs Vasanthi goes home to prepare for the next day. She closes the stall only for Deepavali and the cleaning of the food centre, and would miss even important family functions.\n\nMrs Vasanthi said her daughters, since they were much younger, played a crucial role in shaping the stall and its menu. Older daughter Chandralega even taught herself how to make roti prata.\n\n“The stall had a part in making us who we are today. It was our bread and butter, giving us a better life,” said Ms Chandralega, 26, who works as a nurse at National University Hospital.\n\n“It is heartbreaking to have to let it go but it’s time for my mother, who has done so much for us, to take a break and do what she wants instead of worrying about us.”\n\nMs Chandralega remembers fondly the times the family cooked together during rush hour, Tamil music playing in the background.\n\nSecurity supervisor Durgadevi, 25, said her family always treated the customers like fellow family members. “Our customers recognise Chandralega and me as thosai shop aunty’s children,” she said.\n\n“Everywhere we go, we would meet fans of my mother’s cooking, and it is heartwarming to see people love her food as much as we do.”\n\n“My father helps to clean and cut the vegetables for the day,” said Ms Chandralega. “We adore the relationship between our parents. He encourages her and also buys food for his friends from the stall. We have witnessed their loving support for each other over the years.”\n\nMrs Vasanthi is nervous about the future but she looks forward to spending time with her husband and travelling to Malaysia for the first time. The family will be moving to Bukit Batok by the end of the year.  Mrs Vasanthi also wants to adopt a dog.\n\n“I used to leave money for my children on the dining table before going to the stall,” she said. “Even when they started working, I continued to do so.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn secondary school, 15-year-old Yugaraj Karthik got an opportunity to fly in a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Fokker 50\n\nfighter\n\nplane as part of his National Cadet Corps (NCC) duties.\n\nNeedless to say, he was thrilled to be in the air. Looking out of the window, he saw the vistas on the ground, and decided that his future lay in aviation.\n\nNow aged 24, he is a lieutenant, and has achieved his dream of becoming a fighter pilot.\n\nOn Aug 14, LTA Yugaraj received the SAF Merit Scholarship at the Istana.\n\nThe award is one among seven categories of scholarships awarded by the Ministry of Defence. This time there were 97 recipients.\n\nIntroduced in 1983, the SAF Merit Scholarship is awarded to individuals who have excelled academically and who possess dynamic leadership qualities. To date, there have been 556 SAF Merit Scholarship recipients.\n\nLTA Yugaraj told\n\ntabla!\n\nthat he has always craved challenges despite coming from a conservative family.\n\nHis father is a storekeeper and his mother a housewife. LTA Yugaraj has an elder sister.\n\nHe initially wanted to take up commercial aviation but thought it lacked a deeper purpose.\n\n“Joining NCC in secondary school exposed me to RSAF’s team excellence and professionalism, sparking my interest,” he said.\n\n“I researched the RSAF’s mission and found that it resonated deeply with me,” added LTA Yugaraj, who “studied diligently and prepared well” to get through RSAF’s stringent hiring process.\n\nHe enlisted in April 2018 and from December 2018 to February 2019, he was at the officer cadet school\n\n’s\n\n(OCS) air wing. He then completed a year of basic training as a fighter pilot in Australia and a stint in Canada, where he qualified as a fighter pilot.\n\nLTA Yugaraj described receiving his RSAF pilot wings as “something that will stay with me for a long time”.\n\nThe SAF Merit Scholarship gives LTA Yugaraj the opportunity to study mechanical engineering at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom from this month.\n\nSimilarly, Officer Cadet Rahul Kumar Singh will do a degree in economics and management at Oxford University from next month on an SAF scholarship – second only to the President’s scholarship.\n\nThe midshipman enlisted for Basic Military Training in January and the officer cadet course in March.\n\n“As a student, I was focused on my studies and not physically fit,” said OCT Singh.\n\n“But after enlisting, I set aside time to improve myself. Now I am enjoying the fruit of my labour and looking ahead to a long-term career in RSAF.”\n\nWith\n\nthe\n\nsupport from his lawyer dad and housewife mum, teachers and mentors in the Navy, OCT Singh is assured that he has made the right choice in his field of study.\n\n“Economics deals with how we try to maximise the use of resources to create the best outcome for an organisation,” he explained.\n\n“I am interested in policy and diplomacy work. I hope to do something related to intelligence in the future.\n\n“If we coordinate intelligence across the Singapore Navy, we can be even more effective and have better ties with other nations in both the naval sense and the broader military context.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5bc54a915f68fb2f157044451bf0960497bde197d626a639b39ed9c04a0f7c59?w=825", "alt_text": "From left: LTA Yugaraj Karthik and OCT Rahul Kumar Singh."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cdc5e9ebe511e09ba7a41ea6cb9986d55c1fece793fe7fa0d5f30579110dbb6c?w=825", "alt_text": "From left: LTA Yugaraj Karthik and OCT Rahul Kumar Singh."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5bc54a915f68fb2f157044451bf0960497bde197d626a639b39ed9c04a0f7c59?w=825", "alt_text": "From left: LTA Yugaraj Karthik and OCT Rahul Kumar Singh."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cdc5e9ebe511e09ba7a41ea6cb9986d55c1fece793fe7fa0d5f30579110dbb6c?w=825", "alt_text": "From left: LTA Yugaraj Karthik and OCT Rahul Kumar Singh."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5bc54a915f68fb2f157044451bf0960497bde197d626a639b39ed9c04a0f7c59?w=825", "alt_text": "From left: LTA Yugaraj Karthik and OCT Rahul Kumar Singh."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nHow does the world’s biggest pizza brand respond to high inflation in the world’s most populous nation?\n\nWith the world’s cheapest Domino’s pizza.\n\nThe Rs49 (80 cents) pizza in India, Domino’s No.1 market outside the United States, is the tip of the spear in its fight against rampant inflation that’s squeezing profits and pricing out many customers, according to the CEO of its franchisee in the country.\n\nThe company wants to “own that price point”, said Mr Sameer Khetarpal, confirming that the stripped down, 18cm cheese pizza with a “sprinkle” of basil and parsley is Domino’s cheapest anywhere.\n\n“You are coming to the store or open the app because there is a 49-rupee callout,” he said, adding that Domino’s global team supported the plans.\n\n“Customers are going to eat out less because prices are higher everywhere and our existing consumers should not go out to some competition.”\n\nIterviews with six executives and 12 store managers revealed how Domino’s and other global fast-food giants like Pizza Hut and Burger King are being forced to change tactics to weather rampant inflation in the market of 1.4 billion people.\n\nThe companies are striving to hold on to market share gained over three decades of rapid growth in a nation critical to their futures – and one where it is tough to compete with a street-food culture and a sizzling samosa for as little as Rs10.\n\nMr Khetarpal, whose Jubilant FoodWorks runs 1,816 Domino’s outlets in the country, says he holds a staff meeting first thing every Monday to brainstorm new ways to manage costs and fight the “historic-high inflation” that contributed to its profits sliding 70 per cent in the first-three months of 2023.\n\nHe gave new details of Domino’s India pivot and its financial gains – his company has removed lids from all boxes of pizzas sold at stores starting December, saving 0.6 cents each time. He said that amounts to a significant saving in packaging costs because 37 per cent of Domino’s Indian business is dine-in.\n\nJubilant – whose Domino’s business accounted for most of its US$635 million ($840 million) in revenues last year – also aims to secure rent rebates from some store landlords by offering upfront payments, Mr Khetarpal said, declining to give further details about cost benefits.\n\nDomino’s is not alone in zeroing in on prices in India, a highly price-sensitive market that is currently facing higher inflation than many other markets. Pizza Hut is aggressively promoting pizzas starting at Rs79 that it launched last year and its India franchisee, Sapphire Foods, said it was the brand’s lowest-priced globally.\n\nMr Merrill Pereyra, managing director of Pizza Hut in the Indian subcontinent, said the chain was developing products that “make the brand relevant and easy to access” for price-conscious consumers in India, adding its budget pizzas were a hit with young people.\n\nMcDonald’s launched half-price meals in June. They’ll be the focus of promotion efforts in coming weeks, according to Mr Akshay Jatia, executive director at Westlife Foodworld, which runs 357 outlets in western and southern India. He said the meals would bring in more customers and boost sales and margins.\n\nDomino’s flagship inflation-buster is the Rs49 pizza, which was launched in February. Mr Khetarpal said it was“re-engineered” by cutting price – and tomatoes – from its earlier cheapest offering of Rs59.\n\nFranchisee Jubilant said in May it witnessed a cheese price surge of 40 per cent during 2022-23, and a 30 per cent rise in chicken and paper boxes. There have been more shocks in recent weeks, with tomato prices rising over 400 per cent to record highs and households toiling under rising rates of everything from milk to cereals and spices, according to official data.\n\nThe industry players described a tale of two consumers in a country with yawning gaps between rich and poor.\n\nMany low and middle-income earners who saw dining at foreign chains as a lifestyle upgrade when the economy boomed are tightening belts as inflation bites, while the wealthier continue to spend on products like pricier smartphones, and SUV cars whose sales are touching new highs.\n\nWhen Mr Khetarpal visited Domino’s stores in Chennai and other cities, he said he saw customers emptying out their pockets and only being able to scrape together Rs49. By contrast, he added, Domino’s new gourmet pizzas priced as high as US$14 had seen a sales jump in some affluent areas.\n\nIt’s been a bleak year for Domino’s, the Indian fast-food restaurant leader with a market share of about 12.5 per cent, as well as for other companies.\n\nPre-tax profit at Pizza Hut’s Sapphire Foods more than halved in the March-quarter. Burger King’s India franchisee, Restaurant Brands Asia, saw its net loss widen by 9 per cent.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/16a4c157de5fabb4505283534ae79abbc4d301fccdb7f6645ac0d600f515fb75?w=825", "alt_text": "An employee packing a pizza at a Domino’s restaurant in Noida on July 4."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a text that has been read and studied over the centuries, by scholars everywhere.\n\nIts appeal lies in its relevance to man, offering solutions to the difficult situations that can be applicable to anyone and not just a particular group or race.\n\nCritical analysis and relentless investigation into truth have been the very essence of Hindu thought from Upanishadic times.\n\nThe International Gita Forum (IGF) too is an effort in this timeless sacred search for truth, based on Bhagavad Gita in the modern context. IGF is organised by Gita Jayanti Singapore, a sub-committee of the Hindu Endowments Board.\n\nGita Jayanti provides an avenue for Indian organisations in Singapore to work together harmoniously to celebrate one of the fundamental scriptures of Hinduism. It has also helped nurture a community of like-minded people who are keen to explore and understand the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nStarted in 1997, the single event of mass chanting of the Gita has over the last 25 years evolved into a year-long calendar of events attracting the interest of various age groups – chanting, oratorical, essay and art competitions, cultural programme Krishna Manjari, Gita Havan, monthly satsangs, seminars and forums.\n\nA unique feature of the Gita Jayanti celebrations in Singapore is that they are spearheaded by a different organisation each year and supported by a core team.\n\nThe diversity of the organisations and Hindu temples that lead the Gita Jayanti cuts across the various linguistic and regional boundaries of the Indian community, united in the common goal of celebrating the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe Malwa Cultural Association is taking the lead role for the 26th edition this year.\n\nSwami Sarvapriyananda, minister and spiritual leader of the Vedanta Society of New York, will once again deliver the lectures on self-empowerment from July 27 to 29. He will also conduct a special session for youth on July 29, guiding them on how to reach full potential. The sessions will be in English and entry is free.\n\nThe annual Gita Havan will take place on July 30, featuring a brief lecture by Swami Sarvapriyananda and the chanting of Gita slokas which devotees can join in.\n\nFor more details on the events organised by Gita Jayanti Singapore, go to gitajayanti.org.sg or the Facebook page facebook.com/gitajayantisingapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/329537ad7d4484bc0f1347fa01396314fd4a196c8c743c880e55cddc22855d44?w=825", "alt_text": "Swami Sarvapriyananda at the International Gita Forum held last year."}]}

framework for restructuring the debt of distressed poorer nations.\n\nRepresentatives of the Group of 20 nations had “very intense discussions on global debt vulnerabilities” in Gandhinagar, India, according to Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\n\nShe said at a press conference wrapping up the negotiations on Tuesday that the debt issue remains a “priority” area for the G-20 this year,

reached the compound walls of the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, on July 18 following a period of heavy rain.\n\nThe monument’s visitor viewing area has been flooded and the white marble exterior may suffer some damage, but the high water level will likely raise the moisture content of the structure’s wooden foundation, increasing its life span, said Mr Raj Kumar Patel, superintendent

down poverty across the country.\n\nGovernment approval pending for semiconductor plant in Gujarat\n\nVedanta is awaiting government approval for incentives under a modified semiconductor production plan to begin construction of a plant in Gujarat, for which it has tapped technology and equity partners.\n\nThe metals-to-oil conglomerate has engaged more than 100 global suppliers and ancillary industries which will form a key part of the semiconductor and display ecosystem, said Mr Akarsh Hebbar, global managing director at Vedanta Semiconductors and Display.\n\nVedanta group chairman Anil

should receive a lower 4 per cent fee for in-app purchases – a significant challenge to its payments business model.\n\nDisney’s lawsuit is the latest and most high-profile challenge to Google’s policy of imposing a “service fee” of 11-26 per cent on in-app payments in India.\n\nIt was introduced after an antitrust directive ruled against Google’s earlier 15-30 per cent fee and forced Google to allow third-party payments.\n\nCompanies have argued that Google’s new service fee system is just a cloaked version of its earlier system.\n\nTata to build new electric vehicle battery plant in

of flagship firm Adani Enterprises on Tuesday, he hit back at Hindenburg Research’s “malicious” allegations of corporate fraud and stock manipulation, which he labelled as “false narratives” that

criticism.\n\nVistara prepares to merge staff into Air India\n\nVistara and Air India will merge their manpower as India’s industrial Tata family combines the two carriers to rebuild its aviation empire and take on market leader IndiGo.\n\nVistara, now co-owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, will be folded into Air India under a deal announced in November, giving the Tatas more heft to

Experts have described his achievement as “tectonic and seminal”.\n\nPragg defeated the world’s No. 2 and No. 3 to make it to the World Cup final – a remarkable feat in itself, as no other Indian has competed in the finals since chess legend Vishwanathan Anand won the title in 2002.\n\nPragg also made headlines for becoming the world’s youngest player to play in the finals and the third-youngest to qualify for the Candidates Tournament, putting him in the same league as prodigies like Carlsen and Bobby Fischer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pragg was greeted by hordes of supporters who handed him bouquets of flowers and sweets as he emerged from the airport in his home city of Chennai.\n\n“I am very happy to see so many people have come to receive me... it feels really great,” he said.\n\nSuch adulation is usually reserved in India for cricket stars, who enjoy celebrity status.\n\nThe son of a bank employee and a housewife, the grandmaster has been playing the sport since he was four.\n\nPragg’s success has been fuelled by the cooking of his mother Nagalakshmi, who accompanies him on chess tournaments with pots and southern Indian seasonings to make his favourite meal of rice and spicy rasam or sambhar\n\nsoup\n\n.\n\nNagalakshmi told the ChessBase India news site on Tuesday that she had made rice and sambhar for Pragg at the Fide World Rapid Team Championship in Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nPragg’s first coach S. Thiagarajan, who coached him from age four to 10, said his student was always dedicated.\n\n“He was always a bright student and a jovial child,” Mr Thiagarajan told AFP. “He used to be in the academy every day from 10am to 7pm, at times staying longer – and I would give him homework that would take at least three hours to finish.”\n\nIn 2018, at age 12, Pragg became the world’s then second-youngest chess grandmaster.\n\nChess has gained in popularity in India in the past two decades after 18-year-old Anand became the country’s first grandmaster in 1988 and dominated the game in the 2000s. For a long time, he was the lone flag-bearer of Indian chess, taking the world by storm with his exploits.\n\nThings have changed in the last decade or so, with numerous talented players emerging on the Indian chess scene, making the country a formidable force in the world.\n\nFour Indian players – Pragg, Arjun Erigaisi, D. Gukesh and Vidit Santosh Gujrathi – reached the quarter-final of the World Cup in Baku.\n\nCurrently, there are 21 Indian players who hold positions within the top 100 junior players in the world, all under 20 years of age, with four ranked in the top 10 and seven in the top 20.\n\nThese youngsters “will almost certainly dominate chess for a decade or more,” said columnist and Fide-rated chess player Devangshu Datta.\n\nAnd th\n\ne theory\n\nis is plausible because thousands of young Indians are now playing chess.\n\nSmartphones and cheap Internet access have made it easy for children to hone their skills through apps and online tournaments, while basic chess coaching is easily available as well, reported BBC.\n\nThough Pragg had to settle for runner-up in Baku, he will draw hope from the fact that he has qualified for the Fide Candidates\n\nt\n\nournament.\n\nThe 2024 Candidates Tournament will be an eight-player chess tournament from April 2 to 25 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nThe winner of the tournament will become the challenger for the 2024 World Chess Championship match.\n\nAFP\n\n“He was always a bright student and a jovial child. He used to be in the academy every day from 10am to 7pm, at times staying longer – and I would give him homework that would take at least three hours to finish.”\n\nChess coach S.

Santosh Kumar\n\nUnited States presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy loves rapping and has not shied away from flexing his rap skills in public. His stage name was Da Vek during his undergraduate days at Harvard University.\n\nA video of the Indian-origin candidate rapping to Eminem’s Lose Yourself at the Iowa State Fair last month has gone viral. But this did not go down well with Eminem.\n\nThe rap star on Monday formally asked the conservative entrepreneur not to use his music any more on his campaign trail.\n\nDuring the last two US presidential elections, Rihanna and Adele, among other musicians, had complained that their songs were played at Donald Trump rallies without their permission.\n\nReferring to the Eminem lyrics, Mr Ramaswamy’s campaign spokesman Tricia McLaughlin said, “Vivek just got on the stage and cut loose. To the American people’s chagrin, we will have to leave the rapping to ‘The Real Slim Shady’.”\n\nMr Ramaswamy made light of the situation on X: “Will The REAL Slim Shady please stand up? He didn’t just say what I think he did, did he?”\n\nBut the 38-year-old, who fancies himself as “Trump 2.0”, is serious about his presidential campaign.\n\nHe is enjoying a surge in the Republican primary race and is a frontrunner along with former\n\nUS\n\nPresident Trump to face current US President Joe Biden in the 2024 polls.\n\nHe was one of the stars of the first Republican primary debate held last week, while also hitting the headlines for suggesting that he would like to have business magnate Elon Musk as an adviser if elected President.\n\nMr Ramaswamy clearly wants to be the next Mr Trump: an outsider who will take on the US political establishment, win the presidency and push a hard-right agenda from the Oval Office.\n\n“I’m more similar to Trump in 2015 than Trump today is to Trump in 2015,” Mr Ramaswamy said in an interview last month with British actor and podcast host Russell Brand.\n\nBrand replied, jokingly: “Trump-er than Trump, trumping Trump on Trump-ness.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Mr Ramaswamy would deliver a Trump-like performance at the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential election season – admonishing opponents, relishing attacks and advancing unorthodox policy proposals.\n\nAnd political pundits and media commentators across the country took notice.\n\nWhen the customary post-debate analyses rolled out in the US media after the Aug 23 event, Mr Ramaswamy was widely touted as the night’s winner.\n\n“Vivek Ramaswamy won tonight’s debate and should get a good debate bounce in the polls. He was articulate, comfortable, smiling, coherent, succinct and oozing intellect throughout,” conservative journalist David Brody wrote on social media.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Mr Ramaswamy is still far behind Mr Trump in the Republican nomination race. But he is catching up on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is No. 2.\n\nHis rise highlights the party’s willingness to support candidates with unconventional, hardline ideas – and no previous experience in politics.\n\nThe son of Indian immigrants to the US, Mr Ramaswamy made millions in pharmaceuticals and biotech before authoring a book in 2021 titled Woke, Inc., which put him on the map of right-wing politics.\n\nIn the book, he raged against the push for sustainable and equitable business policies, known as environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG).\n\nMr Ramaswamy has promoted the idea of race-blind “meritocracy” in opposition to policies aimed at bolstering diversity. “Reverse racism is racism,” he often says.\n\nDespite his media appearances, few people would have recognised Mr Ramaswamy’s name when he launched his campaign for the White House this year.\n\nIn the span of a few months, however, he went from a largely unknown figure at the national level to competing with Mr DeSantis for second place in opinion polls in the Republican presidential contest.\n\n“To many Americans, the idea of an outsider being able to correct what’s wrong in Washington is very appealing, particularly – especially for Republicans – if that outsider is a successful businessman,” said Prof Todd Belt, political management programme director at George Washington University.\n\n“And I think that his youth and energy is appealing to people.”\n\nBut for all the praise he has received, Mr Ramaswamy is pushing fringe ideas that liberals describe as dangerous, including climate change denialism and the prospect of military operations against drug dealers in Mexico.\n\nMr Belt agreed but added: “He was saying things that frankly exhibited a lack of understanding of how the government works and the powers of the presidency. The other candidates were trying to expose his ignorance and, in doing so, used his name and ended up giving him more time.”\n\nMr Ramaswamy has poured US$15 million ($20 million) of his own money into his campaign, according to federal election records.\n\n“He’s had tremendous success so far going from zero point zero in the polls to the third place, or in some polls, second place,” said Republican Party strategist Dave Carney.\n\n“The problem is his ideas limit his growth.”\n\nBut, with half of the votes still available to non-Trump voters, Mr Ramaswamy is “taking up oxygen” right now and “dominating a lot of non-Trump conversation”, added Mr Carney.\n\nGiven Mr Ramaswamy’s views on Mr Trump, some are wondering whether he would eventually settle on becoming the former President’s running mate.\n\nBut Mr Ramaswamy has repeatedly said he’s not interested in the running mate role. “Donald Trump and I share something in common, and that is that neither of us would do well in a No. 2 position.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“Donald Trump and I share something in common, and that is that neither of us would do well in a No. 2 position.”\n\nUS presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/72fb0d157950f170f87902857c4848b29798121721f8e7bc5dd6d87d41d4b972?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Vivek Ramaswamy speaks to a reporter after the first Republican presidential primary debate in Wisconsin."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhy didn’t the Punjabi woman win beauty contests?\n\nBecause she was Miss Singh.\n\nThis joke made the rounds after the triumphs of Miss Universe 1994 Sushmita Sen, a Bengali, and Miss Universe 2000 Lara Dutta, an Anglo-Indian.\n\nNaturally, the joke lost its punch\n\na year later\n\nwhen Miss Harnaaz Kaur Sandu, a Punjabi, was crowned Miss Universe 2021.\n\nMore recently, Miss Parvenar Singh Thakral was voted Miss Phuket Thailand. This raised eyebrows, as many people consider\n\nnative\n\nethnic Thai women to be among the most beautiful in the world.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump loves beauty contests, while feminists rightly rail against these events as\n\ncompetitions for\n\nobjectifying women.\n\nMy issue lies in the relevance of these contests.\n\nIt is said that ideal feminine beauty traits include facial features, skin tone, height, body shape and weight.\n\nHowever, there can be no argument that the mass media, fashion magazines, advertisements and even toys such as Barbie dolls relentlessly reinforce the Western concept of beauty.\n\nThanks to these efforts, I sincerely believe that many an Asian man is covertly in love with a slender blonde Caucasian woman.\n\nOf course, it could just be me.\n\nThen, in a very unusual academic exercise, the University of Texas conducted a study of the ideal female form.\n\nIts findings revealed that this should be 1.68m tall with a 99cm bust, 63cm waist and 91cm hips.\n\nBut it came with a disclaimer stating that these measurements should not be taken as “a strict guide” to what is considered beautiful.\n\nThis is followed by the clincher: “The truth is that what one person finds attractive may not be the same for another.”\n\nMakes one wonder why a university would study such an imponderable subject.\n\nIn the pursuit of beauty, some women – and men, to be fair – undergo plastic surgery and procedures such as liposuction, which can have deadly consequences.\n\nThen, there’s skin whitening or bleaching.\n\nWhile it is tempting to blame colonialism and Western beauty propaganda, the preference for a fair complexion among many Asian women has sadly been a part of their societies since ancient times.\n\nIt also contrasts greatly with the sun-tanning ritual among white women in the Western world.\n\nPerhaps singer, songwriter and comedian Ray Stevens got it right with his 1970 song Everything Is Beautiful.\n\nWe should appreciate the beauty in everything and everybody, regardless of what the media or our cultural baggage may tell us.\n\nThere is no one “perfect” body type, skin tone, or face – just to each his or her own.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3ca4e15d106b8fb01396cb07e1f4ee8bacf7e94a91ecdcb1c2e3c43debdf99c5?w=825", "alt_text": "Miss Phuket Thailand Parvenar Singh Thakral."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nChandrayaan-3’s successful landing brings to mind a childhood lesson in the power of a mother’s love.\n\nA child lies in the mother’s lap, looks out the window, sees the crescent Moon, and asks for it. The mother smiles and says she has no way of giving the child the Moon. The child sees the mother’s bent smile, reaches out to touch her face and forgets about the Moon.\n\nI do not know if the origin of this story is Indian, but I heard it when I was growing up in India.\n\nAnother memory is not as pleasant. There is a proverbial Bengali saying “chera kathai shuye chander shopno dekha”, which warns against the temptations of lying on a torn quilt and dreaming of the Moon.\n\nI have always found this saying to be a vulgar attempt to rationalise class inequalities. Since only the poor are likely to lie on a torn quilt, they apparently have no right to fantasise about the Moon.\n\nChandrayaan-3 is testimony to the capacity of a developing nation to produce world-class scientific talent. Some claim that the lunar landing is India’s most significant achievement. That is debatable.\n\nPokhran I and Pokhran II – the nuclear tests of 1974 and 1998 – used indigenous scientific expertise to advance India’s security interests incomparably.\n\nBut I could be wrong. As the saturation of nuclear weapons on the Earth decreases\n\n,\n\nthe strategic value of their destructive compass, the space race is adding a new dimension to warcraft.\n\nCountries capable of colonising space will enjoy the advantages that colonial Europe once did.\n\nTired of incessant wars that had failed to produce a stable balance of power in Europe, those countries exported their rivalries to colonies in Asia and Africa, the squabble over whose distant fate refracted back on the position of the metropolitan powers in Europe.\n\nSimilarly, footholds on the Moon and Mars may well determine the standing of powers back on the Earth in the not-too-far future. That remains to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, what India has achieved with Chandrayaan-3 is the prestige of being the first country to land a spacecraft in the Moon’s south polar region – apart from being only the fourth country after the United States, China and the former Soviet Union to land on the Moon at all.\n\nThe Economist, not given to rapture, captured the moment poetically. It wrote: “The poise with which Chandrayaan-3’s ‘automatic landing sequence’ brought the spacecraft down on to the Moon’s surface was striking. The spacecraft’s trajectory dropped smoothly from thousands of kilometres an hour to walking pace, before a last little cheeky hover as the system checked the landing site and then settled itself down onto the lunar surface. India did not just land its robot on the Moon. It did it with style”.\n\nThe provenance of that “style” is important. It is Indian.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientists responsible for the achievement are Indian. Of course, they studied and excelled at science, which has no nationality.\n\nHowever, they did so with a clear eye to their responsibilities, which lie to India. Salaries account for only a small part of that dedication.\n\nFormer ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair said that the wages the scientists receive for working at the national space agency are hardly one-fifth of global standards.\n\nInstead of being an impediment to research, the poor wages drive ISRO’s scientists to find low-cost ways of exploring space, Mr Nair said, adding that there are no millionaires among ISRO scientists, who live normal lives.\n\nThose normal lives reflect the reality of mass India, where a handful of people command astronomical salaries pegged to global standards, a great number of people struggle to make ends meet and a middle class does what it can in its sandwiched circumstances.\n\nI would imagine that most ISRO scientists are middle class, drawn from the cities, towns and villages that represent India’s demographic geography.\n\nI am certain they could have found a calling in more prosperous fields. Yet, they decided to work for an organisation that embodies India’s reach into space, not in some fabled future promised to come but here and now.\n\nI am\n\nmost\n\nquite certain that some of those scientists once lay in their mothers’ laps and asked for the Moon. If they ever lay on withered quilts, they did not stop dreaming of the silver light in the sky.\n\nNo mother could give her child the Moon.\n\nBut the children have grown up. They have brought the Moon to every Indian mother.\n\nAsad Latif is an editorial writer for The Straits Times.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d878433a0b5d64209341640cfe7179f94dca9e3d165b64534c4a153462d59240?w=825", "alt_text": "Schoolchildren in Ahmedabad praying for the safe landing of Chandrayaan-3."}]}

They won\n\nability to crack the top 100 has largely been due to\n\na record ninth South Asian Football Federation Championship\n\n(SAFF)\n\ntitle in July this year.\n\nThe Blue Tigers also boast the fourth-highest international scorer of all time: Captain and Bengaluru FC’s 38-year-old striker Sunil Chhetri.\n\nWith 92 goals, he is behind only Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo (123), former Iran striker Ali Daei (109) and Argentinian Lionel Messi (103) in the table.\n\nIndia have qualified for the AFC Asian Cup twice in the last four editions, after failing to make it to Asia’s biggest football tournament for national teams between 1984 and 2011.\n\nThe country’s domestic leagues, including the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL), are picking up as well.\n\nWhile the US Major League and Chinese Super League failed to live up to the early promise, the Indian Super League (ISL), the top tier of Indian football, is showing signs of gradual progress.\n\nIts focus on developing infrastructure has helped, said veteran sports presenter and commentator John Dykes, who has covered Indian football\n\nin the past\n\n. “The most important innovation was to insist on grassroots investment by the franchisees.\n\n, and I knew at the time that the initial glitz and glamour around the league would give way to a few administrative headaches and a natural lessening of interest. “But, by focusing on the longer-term in grassroots investment, the authorities were pursuing a path that had the potential to pay dividends down the road for India’s national teams. “Long after Freddie Ljungberg and Luis Garcia, David James and Nicolas Anelka have moved on from India,\n\nI think we are seeing tangible results in terms of the game’s broader appeal.”\n\nThe ISL got the ball rolling in 2013 with veteran international stars. It now has an impressive local flavour.\n\nAccording to the Olympics website, currently an ISL club can sign up to six foreign players. One of them has to be from an Asian Football Confederation (AFC)-affiliated nation.\n\nIn an ISL match, a club can field\n\na maximum of\n\nonly up to four overseas players at any time, including one\n\nplayer\n\nfrom an AFC nation.\n\nDuring its inaugural year (2014), teams were allowed to sign a maximum of 11 overseas players, while up to six foreign players could feature in a playing 11 at any given time.\n\nThe ISL began as a closed league,\n\nsimilar to the US major league. I\n\nbut is now moving to a promotion and relegation system\n\nthat European football fans are used to\n\n. The champions of the second tier I-league\n\n, the of Indian football,\n\nwill be promoted to the ISL from this season\n\nonwards\n\n.\n\nAfter consultations with the AFC, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) announced that the I-League winners will get “direct slots” in the ISL from 2022 onwards and that there would be relegation starting with the 2024-25 season.\n\nIt has taken a little longer to implement the promotion system. RoundGlass Punjab FC are the first promoted team to compete in the new ISL season that is set to kick off next month.\n\nIt is not to say that India’s\n\nThe domestic football scene may not be entirely rosy, but India is headed in the right direction, says Rohit Ramesh, owner of former I-league club Chennai City FC.\n\n“Right now, clubs still depend on government funding, but it is beginning to look healthy and clubs are focused on developing their infrastructure (training facilities, stadiums and dressing rooms),” he said. “Most clubs are working towards their infrastructure for the betterment of their own future.”\n\nAlthough Chennai City are not competing in the ISL or I-league at the moment, their I-league win in 2019 attracted international attention when the AIFF launched an inquiry into their championship decider aginst Minerva, after the match commissioner expressed suspicion. Chennai were cleared of any wrongdoing later.\n\nAny doubt of India not having enough\n\nfootball\n\ntalent was quashed by Singaporean Akbar Nawas, who formerly coached Chennai City and is now head coach at Thailand’s\n\nLeague 1 side\n\nNakhon Pathon.\n\n“Players in the south have a lot of raw skill and it is only the tactical side of their game that needed improving. A lot of coaches are trying to implement their school of thought and they seem to be succeeding right now\n\n. Indian football has progressed by leaps and bounds\n\n,” said Akbar, the first Singaporean to coach a Thai top division side.\n\nSome Indian clubs even have a strong social media presence now. ISL club Kerala Blasters are one of the top 100 most followed football clubs in the world, according to\n\na report published by\n\nNews18 and other websites\n\nrecently\n\n. They have some 3.4 million followers on Instagram alone. Domestic games are attracting bigger crowds too.\n\nChennaiyin FC defender Ajith Kumar said:\n\nISL games are now being played in packed stadiums.“Stadiums used to have 5,000 to 7,000 fans when I first became a professional footballer (in 2018),” said 26-year-old. “Now a stadium can have up to about 60,000 fans.”Ajith, a former teammate of Chhetri at Bengaluru, explained how players have benefited from the foreign coaches plying their trade in India.\n\n“We have top\n\nnotch\n\nstrength and condition coaches. Almost all coaches in the league are foreign. They have taught local professional footballers the importance of taking care of their body\n\n(gym, workouts and diet). “Football was pretty much an amateur sport until foreign coaches helped develop it in India\n\n.”\n\nWith so much progress domestically and the national team showing significant improvement under Croat coach and former English Premier League player Igor Stimac, it may not be too long before India start dreaming about qualifying for the Fifa World Cup\n\nagain\n\n.\n\nIndia famously qualified for the 1950 edition only to withdraw later because the players were not used to playing with boots.\n\nIndia are currently drawn in group A of the 2026 World Cup Qualification AFC second round along with Qatar, Afghanistan or Mongolia and Kuwait. They defeated Kuwait in the SAFF Cup final recently.\n\n“Please stand by us. Have faith. We will give beautiful football,” promised Stimac in an interview with India Today, ahead of next month’s Asian Games football tournament in Hangzhou, China.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b080aa63960e6c129905b01004489d92d86b345548f5b0306c83b0e41eedd2f1?w=825", "alt_text": "The Blue Tigers are on an upswing."}]}

Mr Tharman was the first speaker in this new series of regular Indian community dialogue sessions that Tamil Murasu will spearhead.\n\nSPH\n\n1\n\nof\n\n2\n\nNext\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nPresidential candidate Tharman Shanmugaratnam loves South Indian food, especially thosai.\n\nWhenever he visits India or other places that have South Indian restaurants, he makes it a point to indulge in his favourite dish, often with his wife Jane Yumiko Ittogi, who is of Chinese-Japanese ancestry.\n\n“If you plan to have something that is not fancy, thosai is reasonably good,” he told a gathering of 110 people at the inaugural Tamil Murasu Thosai Breakfast Club session on Aug 19. “It is a very healthy breakfast, like idli.\n\n“Actually, scientists say it is a very healthy breakfast, especially if you don’t put too much oil..\n\nwhen you cook the potatoes\n\n.”\n\nThe Tamil Murasu Thosai Breakfast Club brings together eminent personalities and members of the Indian community to discuss issues of the day in a casual setting.\n\n“There’s something more aesthetic about South Indian cuisine and culture,” said Mr Tharman, a former Senior Minister who served the Singapore government in various capacities for 22 years. “I wouldn’t use the word spiritual, but there is something more basic.\n\n“South Indian food has a distinctive tang as well. So, both my wife and I really love South Indian food. Whenever we go to India... Delhi, Mumbai, wherever, we go to restaurants that serve good South Indian food.”\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to music, Mr Tharman likes South Indian classical music.\n\n“I grew up with Indian music at home because my father was a flautist who also played the piano,” he said. “Carnatic music always played in the background.\n\n“I love Indian music in general. But Carnatic music again has something different about it.\n\n“Actually, it is very encouraging that there are more initiatives now to blend Hindustani and Carnatic music styles and approaches.\n\n“Less than a year ago, I attended a performance by a group called Triveni. The musicians were North Indians and South Indians, all famous in their own right. Together, they produced really beautiful music. Hopefully, such amalgamations will take off.”\n\nAs the presidential election nears, more people are curious to know about Mr Tharman’s family life, especially his meeting with Ms Ittogi in London, where they were both university students.\n\n“Well, actually, my wife and I didn’t suddenly fall in love,” said Mr Tharman, when asked by the moderator, Tamil Murasu news editor Irshath Mohamed, if it was instant attraction. “It was not like there was this sudden click.\n\n“We were friends in a circle of friends and we got to know each other better. In fact, we knew each other for a long time. And we just got to know each other better and better and it just became obvious that we were going to spend our lives together.\n\n“So, love was just a cascading movement, until we realised that we wanted to spend our lives together. There was  nothing sudden, nothing dramatic.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Mr Tharman discussed the pros and cons extensively with his wife before deciding to run for the presidency. But what were the thoughts of his children? How did they react?\n\nMr Tharman, 66, and Ms Ittogi have a daughter and three sons\n\ntogether\n\n.\n\n“Of course, you know, I discussed it extensively with my wife,” he said. “It was a joint decision because it’s a major change in my role and to some extent in my life. My children just wanted to understand why.\n\n“They knew this was not something I treated as an ambition. It’s not as if I’m aiming for some position. I’ve never aimed to be in any position, quite honestly. I’ve never planned my life from the very start.\n\n“At each stage, you just do what you feel will be most meaningful, where you can contribute the most. And it must be something that you also enjoy doing. At each stage of my career, it’s been that way.\n\n“So, my children just needed to understand my motivation, and accepted my decision and my wife’s decision on that basis.\n\n“This was very important because they lead their own lives. They take only public buses, occasionally Grab, and they lead their own independent lives. It’s been that way all along.”\n\nThe children’s independent streak must surely have come from Mr Tharman, who pointed out that he\n\nfairly\n\nusually did what he wanted during his days at Anglo-Chinese School.\n\n“I was actually quite lucky, because I really enjoyed my youth,” he said. “It’s the greatest benefit I’ve had in life.\n\n“I spent all my time on sports. I was an extreme case, because every single day I’d be playing sports.\n\n“And I remember once in my secondary three, I kept a little diary, not to write any reflections, but to note down my competition times at the Padang.\n\n“I played sports every day, unless there was torrential rainfall and you really couldn’t play outdoors. So, my entire life was sports.”\n\nMr Tharman said his parents did not put pressure on him to study well.\n\n“I had a very colourful report book every year for my parents to sign,” he said. “Just before the exams, I would figure out a way to cram up in order to get to the next level just decently. I never wanted to be at the top or anything like that. I just did enough.”\n\nBut he also took advantange of sports to make friends.\n\n“Sports means you meet people, and in those days there was sporting talent all around the island,” said Mr Tharman.\n\n“Naval Base Secondary was very good at hockey, Jurong Secondary very good at rugby, so there were good athletes all over the island.\n\n“When you take part in competitive sports, you really meet people from very different backgrounds, not just ethnically but also socio-economic backgrounds. You beat them and you become good friends.\n\n“And you respect them, because in sports you’re never the best at everything. And you never win all the time. You really have to respect your opponents. So, that was a very intense social experience.\n\n“When you go through 12 years playing competitive sports, you really gain respect for a whole set of fellow Singaporeans and it’s a wonderful way to grow. So I had a whale of a time as a youth, and I will never give that up for anything.”\n\nMr Tharman believes the friendships he has cultivated since his youth and the hard work he has done on the ground during his years in politics will stand him in good stead when he comes up against former chief investment officer at sovereign wealth fund GIC Ng Kok Song, 75, and former chief executive of insurer NTUC Income Tan Kin Lian, 75, in the presidential election on Sept 1.\n\n“My confidence comes from the fact that first and foremost, I have worked very hard on the ground,” he said. “Everyone knows what I’ve been doing.\n\n“I know people very well, I’ve gotten to know families. I’ve created initiatives, I’ve even created NGOs, to do things that the government can’t do.\n\n“So, that’s what politics is about. It’s about a track record of empathy and helping people transform their lives.\n\n“The second thing is national policymaking. I entered politics in the first place because I wanted to reform policy, educational policy, social policies and some economic policies.\n\n“I think in 20 years we have shifted a fair bit and that was also my motivation. I’ve had a role in shifting policies, and I regard it as a plus.\n\n“Thirdly, I have international experience, leadership experience in various international councils, which would not have come about if I had not been playing this role in Singapore.\n\n“So, these are actually invaluable additions to my experience and my capabilities that I think will be a big plus for the presidency.”\n\nMr Tharman believes another plus for him is that he is “independent minded”.\n\n“Everyone knows I’ve got my own mind,” he said. “I stand my ground and in what I believe in.\n\n“Importantly, I have experience, an independent mind and the ability to work with all parties in the interests of Singapore.\n\n“You can’t just be a solo player. If you’re a solo player, you will soon become irrelevant.”\n\nEveryone knows I’ve got my own mind, I stand my ground and in what I believe in.\n\nPresidential candidate Tharman Shanmugaratnam", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c56e09a8d1f667e102d89d150ec328eec399268fd17717031a7bad59747aa206?w=825", "alt_text": "TM20230819_202385906872/TMTharman19/Shintaro Tay/ Presidential hopeful Tharman Shanmugaratnam was the guest speaker for Tamil Murasu's new Thosai Breakfast Club series.

But then, after Tiwari returned to Noida to be with his first wife, he did not want to go to Bangaladesh again and sought a divorce from Akhtar.”\n\nMs Akhtar said she tried to establish contact with Mr Tiwari through his mobile phones, but found that all the numbers were unreachable.\n\nShe then decided to travel to India.\n\nWhen she reached Noida, the police detained her and kept her in a detention centre in Sector-62.\n\nLater, the women’s cell of the Noida Police Commissionerate tried to mediate between Mr Tiwari and Ms Akhtar, but did not succeed.\n\nACP Kulkarni said the woman and her child are now at a care centre.\n\nThe Noida police are in a tizzy because Ms Akhtar has made it clear that Mr Tiwari should either return to Bangladesh with her or she will stay with him in Noida.\n\n“The matter has been sent to ACP (Women and Child Safety) for further probe,” the police said in a statement.\n\nThe incident comes on the heels of Noida Police arresting Pakistani national Seema Haider for illegally entering India through Nepal to live with her Indian partner Sachin Meena in Greater Noida.\n\nShe came\n\nalong\n\nwith her four children – all aged below seven – in May and lived in a rented accommodation secretly.\n\nThe police arrested her and Mr Meena on July 4, but a local court granted them bail on July 7.\n\nThe pair have been living together since, even as the Noida Police and the UP Anti-Terrorist Squad continue separate investigations into the case.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c0e13e9f43ce32474ac9d7b5b9233d7b693fbb84efc63286eeca43d354bb35fc?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Sonia Akhtar with her child, after arriving from Bangladesh."}]}

You can try that and other combinations at\n\nUnlike the roti prata stalls that you find in the\n\nheartland stall Prata Lahhh!\n\nis special\n\n.\n\nIts young owner Ghauthaman Ramanan has established the business as “Singapore’s first DIY prata stall”.\n\nAccording to dining app Burpple Singapore, customers can go to the BGAIN 121 Eating House in Hougang Avenue 1\n\nresidential estate\n\nand experiment with the different flavours.\n\nFor\n\n30-year-old\n\nmillennial hawker Ghauthaman, the concept was not difficult to envisage as he comes from a\n\nlong line\n\nfamily of renowned prata makers in Singapore.\n\nHis father Ramanan owns Casuarina Curry that has three outlets islandwide; his uncle Elango is behind Springleaf Prata Place which has nine outlets; and his cousin Guna runs Gandhi Restaurant in Little India.\n\nLaunched in December 2022, the trendy Prata Lahhh! allows customers to create their own prata by choosing from an array of ingredients such as crab meat, sausage, prawn, mutton keema, chicken, sardine and sambal.\n\nThe ingredients are available in the fridge and, after you choose the filling, the chef will create the\n\nprata with various combinations that comes with a crispy\n\ngolden-brown\n\ntexture\n\nprata.\n\nThe innovative picks include Bull’s Eye and Eggs Benedict, and prata made with honey, condensed milk and chocolate.\n\nDiners also have other choices on the menu, including goreng dishes, thosai and briyani. And they can customise the thosai and goreng dishes too.\n\nThe prata is reasonably priced between $1.30 and $5.\n\nMr Ghauthaman, 30, told\n\ntabla!\n\nthat he always wanted to live up to his family legacy.\n\nHe entered the family business at 14, and learnt prata flipping and dough pinching techniques from his father and uncle. He mastered other kitchen skills gradually.\n\nThe marketing and business management graduate also worked in the sales sector for two years, before deciding to run his own food and beverages business.\n\nWhile bouncing off business ideas with his family members serves well for Mr Ghauthaman, his work experience in the sales sector\n\nThis helped him sharpen his finance skills and dealings with customers.\n\nBut he feels he is not a prata master yet and there is always room for improvement and innovations.\n\n“Cooking is in my blood,” he told\n\ntabla!\n\n“Bringing this DIY concept to prata was very easy.\n\n“Prata is always a popular choice among Singaporeans, and letting them choose their favourite ingredients and incorporating them into it is definitely a bonus for my customers.”\n\nUsually a prata is made with ghee, sugar and flour. The pratas at Prata Lahhh! have a crispy texture. Mr Ghauthaman said it is the result of a secret ingredient.\n\nThe stall, which is open every day, attracts about 200 customers on weekdays and about 400 on weekends.\n\n“It’s heartening to see some customers come from Holland Village and Woodlands just to taste my prata,” said Mr Ghauthaman. His favourite customer is a boy who visits the stall every holiday without fail and always orders Bull’s Eye prata.\n\nSecondary four student Rebecca is impressed with the range of pratas available at Prata Lahhh!.\n\n“It’s\n\nreally unique to see\n\nsuch a different concept while ordering prata,” she said. “The owner is super-friendly and caring, and makes sure that we enjoy our meals.”\n\nMr Ghauthaman likes to innovate and bring trendy food ideas to the table.\n\nHis next step is to match wines and pratas.\n\n“There will always be people who are ready to discourage,” he said. “\n\nOne must dust them off and\n\nJust focus on what you wish to accomplish. Planning smartly is the key.”\n\nWith understanding wife Suganthi by his side, Mr Ghauthaman is all geared up to open another Prata Lahhh! outlet at Changi Village later this year\n\nwith more funky dishes\n\n. His eventual aim is to expand his business overseas.\n\nPrata is always a popular choice among Singaporeans, and letting them choose their favourite ingredients... is definitely a bonus for my customers.\n\n(Left) Mr Ghauthaman Ramanan of Prata Lahhh!", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/02677467ff7704a6bbc96d5a27467fad270657f9b3ae702a003de3313a874c17?w=825", "alt_text": ""}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAn Indian spacecraft became the first to land on the rugged, unexplored south pole of the moon on Wednesday in a mission seen as crucial to lunar exploration and India’s standing as a space power, just days after a similar Russian lander crashed.\n\n“This moment is unforgettable. It is phenomenal. This is a victory cry of a new India,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who waved the Indian flag as he watched the landing from South Africa, where he was attending a Brics summit with the leaders of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa.\n\nScientists and officials clapped, cheered and hugged each other as the spacecraft landed and people across India broke out in celebration, setting off firecrackers and dancing in the streets.\n\n“India is on the moon,” said Mr S. Somanath, chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as the Chandrayaan-3 landed, making India the fourth nation to successfully land\n\na spacecraft\n\non the moon after the United States, China and the former Soviet Union.\n\nChandrayaan-3’s rover “ramped down” from the lander on Thursday and “India took a walk on the Moon!”, ISRO said. The 26kg rover, Pragyaan, will now roam around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images\n\nto be sent back to Earth for analysis\n\n.\n\nPragyaan, which is carrying\n\ntwo\n\nscientific instruments to find out what minerals are present on the lunar surface,\n\nand study the chemical composition of the soil.Pragyaan\n\nwill communicate only with the lander. That will then send the information to the orbiter from the earlier Chandrayaan-2, which is still circling the Moon, to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.\n\nISRO shared photos from the spacecraft showing the moon’s surface and the leg and shadow of the lander.\n\nRough terrain makes a south pole landing difficult, but the region’s ice could supply fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin congratulated India in a message to Mr Modi\n\npublished on the Kremlin website\n\n. “This is a big step forward in space exploration and\n\nof course\n\na testament to the impressive progress made by India in\n\nthe field of\n\nscience and technology,” he said.\n\nIn the United States, Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated the ISRO on\n\nthe landing\n\nX and added:\n\n“And congratulations to India on being the 4th country to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon,” he said on X.\n\n“We’re glad to be your partner on this mission!”\n\nThis was India’s second attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon, less than a week after Russia’s Luna-25 mission failed. People across the country were glued to television screens\n\nand said prayers\n\nas the spacecraft approached the surface. Nearly 7 million watched a YouTube live stream.\n\nChandrayaan means “moon vehicle” in Hindi and Sanskrit. In 2019, ISRO’s Chandrayaan-2 mission\n\nsuccessfully\n\ndeployed the orbiter but its lander crashed.\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 is expected to remain functional for two weeks\n\n, running a series of experiments including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition of the lunar surface\n\n.\n\nThe moon rover will take a few hours or a day to come out of the spacecraft,\n\nMr Somanath said\n\n, adding that\n\nthe landing has given India confidence to\n\nextend its reach to possible voyages to Mars and Venus and it is. India is also planning to launch a mission in September to study the sun, Mr Somanath said. A\n\ngo further and a human space flight is also planned\n\nand, while no official date has been announced, preparations are likely to be ready by next year\n\n.\n\nThe landing is expected to boost India’s reputation for cost-competitive space engineering. The Chandrayaan-3 was launched with a budget of about Rs6.15 billion ($100 million), less than what it cost to produce the 2013 Hollywood space thriller Gravity.\n\n“Landing on the south pole would\n\nactually\n\nallow India to explore if there is water ice on the moon. And this is very important for cumulative data and science on the geology of the moon,” said Ms Carla Filotico, a partner and managing director at consultancy SpaceTec Partners.\n\nAnticipation before the landing was feverish, with banner headlines across Indian newspapers and news channels running countdowns.\n\nPrayers were held at places of worship across the country, and\n\nSchool children waved the Indian tricolour at live screenings of the landing. There were prayers at various places of worship.\n\nChildren gathered on the banks of the Ganga river, considered holy by Hindus, to pray for a safe landing, and mosques offered prayers.\n\nAt a gurduwara in the capital New Delhi, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri also offered prayers.\n\n“Not just economic, but India is achieving scientific and technological progress as well,” he said.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/00c17646470cf833e163ce3aba077c904d2578bbf53b43cc7cf46aac52d77043?w=825", "alt_text": "People (left) react as they watch an image of Chandrayaan-3 landing on the moon (above), at the Gujarat Science City in Ahmedabad."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/90610ff3a15e294e6b4e6fcd232741a73fcf5fc1646c70ebca0b92299d080139?w=825", "alt_text": "People (left) react as they watch an image of Chandrayaan-3 landing on the moon (above), at the Gujarat Science City in Ahmedabad."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/00c17646470cf833e163ce3aba077c904d2578bbf53b43cc7cf46aac52d77043?w=825", "alt_text": "People (left) react as they watch an image of Chandrayaan-3 landing on the moon (above), at the Gujarat Science City in Ahmedabad."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/90610ff3a15e294e6b4e6fcd232741a73fcf5fc1646c70ebca0b92299d080139?w=825", "alt_text": "People (left) react as they watch an image of Chandrayaan-3 landing on the moon (above), at the Gujarat Science City in Ahmedabad."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/00c17646470cf833e163ce3aba077c904d2578bbf53b43cc7cf46aac52d77043?w=825", "alt_text": "People (left) react as they watch an image of Chandrayaan-3 landing on the moon (above), at the Gujarat Science City in Ahmedabad."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nWith his latest film Jailer, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth has achieved what is considered one of the greatest comebacks ever.\n\nAccording to trade analyst Manobala Vijayabalan, it has become the second fastest Tamil film to gross more than Rs550 crore ($89.9 million) worldwide.\n\nThe action film, which was dubbed in Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada and released on Aug 10, entered the Rs550 crore club on its 12th day in theatres, compared with 2.0, also a Rajinikanth film, which reached the milestone in only eight days in 2018.\n\nThe resounding success has restored Rajinikanth’s image as a box-officer hero, after his previous two releases Annaatthe (2021) and Darbar (2019) did not do well.\n\nThe 72-year-old’s title of superstar has also been reinstated, after fans of rival Thalapathy Vijay began to claim earlier this month that the 49-year-old was indeed the superstar, after stringing together several hits in recent years.\n\nAlso starring Jackie Shroff, Mohanlal, Shivrajkumar and Kishore in cameos, Jailer follows the story of a retired police officer, who uses his connections with former prisoners to save his son from a gangster.\n\nRajinikanth plays the role of the jailer, Muthuvel Pandian, aka Tiger.\n\nHis remarkable screen presence, the quirky direction of Nelson Dilipkumar and Anirudhu’s background score have also contributed much to the success of the film.\n\nJailer is the first film in two years to feature Rajinikanth, who enjoys a demigod-like status among his fans. And they wanted the film to be a hit, to silence the rival group of Vijay’s supporters in Tamil Nadu.\n\n“After a point, I don’t talk. I only slash,” Rajinikanth says in Jailer. And he has once again proved that, if push comes to shove, he will emerge on top.\n\nTamil actor Sathyaraj, best known worldwide for his role as Kattappa in director SS Rajamouli’s blockbuster film Baahubali (2015  and 2017), believes that the title “Superstar” will now on always refer to Rajinikanth.\n\n“We call a person superstar if he is number one in the film business and remuneration,” said Sathyaraj.  “Initially, they called Charlie Chaplin a superstar. Then, they called Rajesh Khanna a superstar. But for the last 45 years, we all think of only Rajinikanth when the term superstar is uttered. That shouldn’t be changed. For me, superstar means Rajinikanth.”\n\nReferring to Vijay’s claims to the title, Sathyaraj further substantiated his opinion: “Thyagaraja Bhagavathar was Tamil Nadu’s first superstar. But nobody addressed him that way. He was referred to by the title Iyal Isai Mannar (King of Prose and Poetry).\n\n“The next superstar was MGR. We call him ‘Makkal Thilagam’ MGR. Nobody else other than these people should be referred to by these titles.\n\n“Will you agree if Rajinikanth was referred to as ‘Makkal Thilagam’ Rajinikanth? It shouldn’t be that way. The title used for Rajinikanth is superstar, and that shouldn’t change.”\n\nAt an audio launch of Jailer, the normally reticent Rajinikanth narrated a story about the crow being the most raucous of all birds, constantly trying to pull down other birds. Yet, the crow never manages to reach the eagle, who glides far above all the commotion.\n\n“Social media might go on to compare and draw names on whom I called a crow. I request you not to do that as I have only spoken about what happens practically, and it is not directed at any person,” he said, according to News18.\n\nHowever, fans of Vijay, Tamil cinema’s GenNow heartthrob, seem in no no mood to relent, with all awaiting the release of their star’s  film Leo on Oct 19 to once again up the ante.\n\nNot to be outdone in the game of swagger, Vijay has stylishly played to the gallery in a promotional video of Leo, featuring the song Bloody Sweet.\n\n“I’m gonna take it away… hell yeah! This is how I wanna play. This is how I’m gonna play,” the lyrics seem to make an ominous assertion to the beats of slow, haunting rock.\n\nJailer was important to Rajinikanth because the film’s success underlines that age is a challenge his popularity has managed to conquer.\n\nMeanwhile for Vijay, born almost a quarter-century later, Leo offers opportunities to set a few records of his own.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\nFor me, superstar means Rajinikanth.\n\nTamil actor Sathyaraj", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e377b28fff9ee8d38eb083a163f2e17c72cd524df81289fa7144dc22f53da024?w=825", "alt_text": "Fans spray milk on a Rajinikanth banner from the film Jailer."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor is in hot water, after controversial comments he made about actresses, including Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif, were dug out by netizens who sent them viral.\n\nHis troubles began during a recent live session when his wife, the acclaimed actress Alia Bhatt, mentioned that she had to remove her lipstick on his insistence.\n\nShe revealed that when he was her boyfriend, Ranbir would often ask her to “wipe off” her lipstick because he liked her natural lip colour.\n\nThe comment may have seemed unremarkable to the couple, now married with a daughter, Raha. But many netizens took offence and set off an online storm.\n\nThe clip soon sparked massive outrage, and people saw it as their business to advise Alia that this should be taken as a “red flag” in her marriage.\n\nNetizens began calling Ranbir “a controlling husband”, and some even sarcastically directed Alia to “blink twice if she is in domestic trouble”.\n\nThen, even as the controversy was raging, one Internet user brought out an infographics article compiled by Scoopwhoop titled “To the Ranbir Kapoor’s of the world, here are 12 things you can’t say to women”.\n\nThe link went viral on Reddit.\n\nThe series has Ranbir’s images fading in the backdrop as he utters misogynist comments.\n\nIn one, he is quoted as saying: “When a woman is heartbroken, all she needs to do is go to the salon, and before you know it, she has moved on to someone else.”\n\nIn another, Ranbir calls Alia “a very loud personality”.\n\nWhile another post reportedly refers to Anushka: “She is the anxiety queen.

But expectations and needs have also grown, noted PM Lee.\n\n“So, to say today you put aside systematically 2 per cent, 3 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) and build up a sovereign fund from scratch, I think it is very hard. The economy will not be able to take it,” he said.\n\nPM Lee said he was proud that Singapore had built up the reserves, and is anxious that the country keeps it like this for as long as it can.\n\n“\n\nBecause\n\nIt is one of those things – once it is gone, it will never come back again. It is finished,” he said.\n\n“I think we need to be very, very conscious that this is a Garden of Eden state. You are here, it is marvellous. You may not always feel great, but please be aware this is the Garden of Eden because if you come out from it, you cannot go back in again by the sweat of your brow.”\n\nPM Lee was responding to questions on Singapore’s reserves, including its functions and its history, in an interview with national broadcaster CNA that was aired on Wednesday in a documentary titled Singapore Reserves Revealed. The interview was conducted on June 8.\n\nWhen asked what the reserves mean to him, PM Lee said they are a great source of comfort and reassurance that if Singapore runs into a jam, it will not be destitute and will have “one extra card to play”.\n\nIt gives the Government confidence, but is also a reminder of the forefathers’ contributions and a responsibility to generations to come, he added.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/reserves-cane28099t-be-built-up-again-once-gone-1402886?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFour years as Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner in Singapore was challenging for Ms Sashikala Premawardhane. But it was also “very fruitful”.\n\n“Clearly, Covid-19 was a difficult period,” the career diplomat, who will be returning to Colombo soon to take up a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told\n\ntabla!\n\n. “We had border closures on both sides and short-term travellers from Sri Lanka were stuck here.\n\nWe did not have a lot of funding to deal with the situation.\n\n“But what I saw was an outpouring of support from the Singapore community. They gave us support to house the short-term travellers until the borders opened and Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided our workers,  who had finished their contracts and were waiting to go back home, with quarantine facilities so they didn’t have to spend money.”\n\n“That was a wonderful reflection of the community linkages. We operated seven repatriation flights together with Sri Lankan airlines and sent back about 1,500 people.”\n\nMs Premawardhane was thankful to the Temasek Foundation for providing test kits, oxygen machines and ventilators for those suffering from Covid-19 in Sri Lanka.\n\n“The Singapore Red Cross Society and the Singapore Sri Lanka Business Association also raised funds for us,” she said. “Several individual donors supported our efforts.\n\n“We had about 800 students studying here who had issues of getting finances from Sri Lanka. For about two months, we cooked food for them, both lunch and dinner, and the staff from the High Commission actually delivered it.\n\n“\n\nSo, at that point,\n\nw\n\ne learnt a lot about each other, about the kind of support we can get in Singapore. It was a wonderful experience of bilateral support.”\n\nSri Lankan workers in Singapore, Ms Premawardhane pointed out, are well looked after\n\nbecause there are lots of rules and regulations in place\n\n. “Out of the 13,000 Sri Lankans in Singapore, about 3,000 are domestic workers,” she said. “During Covid, we provided them with information and support.\n\n“We set up a women’s cricket team of migrant workers and educated them on mental health and how to manage their finances and send money home through legal channels.”\n\n“Apart from that, we don’t have a lot of issues on the welfare front.”\n\nThe High Commission has focused on promoting the entry of skilled and semi-skilled workers into Singapore, said Ms Premawardhane.\n\n“A lot of work we did for about one and a half years was to increase the entry of Sri Lankan nurses,” she said.\n\n“We did not have Sri Lankan nurses in Singapore before. Now we have 108, and more are coming. The Ministry of Health’s nursing board have been holding exams in Sri Lanka and our nurses have done well.”\n\nThe strong community ties have made this process smooth, said Ms Premawardhane, who\n\nShe observed that Sri Lanka’s relationship with Singapore overall is “very good, very friendly and warm”.\n\n“Visits have taken place at a high level,” she said.\n\n“And we are expecting a working visit of the President very soon.\n\n“There were  a few issues with the free trade agreement signed in 2018. But those have been resolved and we are going forward with it.”\n\nFor much closer cooperation,\n\nMs Premawardhane would like Singapore to do more trade with and investments in Sri Lanka.\n\n“The trade at the moment is heavily in favour of Singapore,” she said. “We hope that we’ll bridge that gap to a certain extent soon.”\n\nSri Lankan tea, of course, is popular in Singapore, along with seafood, especially crab.\n\n“I think there’s a lot more scope for cooperation between the two sides on food security,” she said. “Sri Lanka is a good source for agricultural and fisheries produce\n\n. That’s something that Singapore needs to look at a little bit more closely\n\n.\n\n“But we would require a lot of investments in that area, as we need to develop more warehousing and distribution capabilities. And, for that, I think Singapore has several giants who can come into Sri Lanka and help us.\n\n“We would also like to see more investments in the renewable energy and real estate sectors.”\n\nDespite the socio-economic upheaval Sri Lanka has faced, Ms Premawardhane feels it is a safe country to visit. “Till July this year, we had more than 700,000 visitors from across the globe,” she said. “That demonstrates that it’s a safe country to travel to. We see a lot of tourists coming in, and hopefully there will be more tourists from Singapore coming in as well.\n\n“Sri Lanka has really bounced back\n\nquite quickly from the economic downturn. We have been able to secure the IMF extended fund facility of close to US$3 billion. And that that gives a lot of stability on the macroeconomic front\n\n.

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingapore music group Brahmastra has for the first time embarked on a South-east Asia tour to showcase the country’s rich cultural diversity.\n\nThe seven-member ensemble – consisting of Niranjan Pandian (venu and bansuri), Gildon Choo (pipa), Govin Tan (ethnic percussions including tabla), Tan Wen Bin (cello), Azrin Abdullah (oud), Caleb Koa (keyboard) and Dinesh Kumar (mridangam) – will be playing original Indian contemporary music fused with an exceptional array of sounds in Indonesia and Thailand from Aug 15 to 23.\n\n“Our mission goes beyond music, we aspire to foster connections between communities throughout South-east Asia,” said Niranjan, a multi-award-winning composer and flautist. “This ambitious endeavour has been made possible through the invaluable support of the National Arts Council.”\n\nThe concerts titled Sounds of Diversity, which are being held at various venues in Indonesia and Thailand, are unique because they present a multi-ethnic set-up that intricately weaves together the foundations of Indian classical music with a tapestry of diverse musical genres and styles, including elements of jazz and blues.\n\nThe accomplished musicians will also display their remarkable skills and provide insights into the collaborative process – which was made possible by the skilful music direction of Niranjan.\n\n“The concerts are a splendid leap forward for Brahmastra,” said Niranjan. “They not only celebrate musical diversity but also symbolises a significant stride towards artistic unity and innovation.”\n\nThe original compositions by Niranjan spotlight the diverse talents of the Brahmastra ensemble. Among the featured pieces are Desire, Invocation and a creatively re-imagined arrangement of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s noted composition Mohana Kalyani Thillana.\n\n“This blend of musical influences goes beyond cultural boundaries, offering an immersive auditory experience that resonates with contemporary audiences,” said Niranjan. “Our aim is to create a dynamic harmony of diverse cultures, crafting a musical tapestry that speaks to the essence of the present moment.”\n\nThe Brahmastra group members will also engage in panel discussions where they will share their creative processes.\n\n“Through these discussions, we aim to not only showcase our work but also foster a deeper understanding of the harmonious coexistence of diverse musical influences,” said Niranjan.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aa3474ee8216344cf098ae9e0e823063482c872c783206e54b5cda40478dbd35?w=825", "alt_text": "Multi-ethnic music group Brahmastra"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSomen Debnath left home in 2004, promising himself he would travel to 191 countries on his bicycle.\n\nThe 20-year-old’s intention was to spread awareness about HIV/Aids around the world, then a deadly epidemic in India and other countries.\n\nTwo decades later, the threat from the killer virus seems to be receding, with promising medical advances, but it’s too early to declare victory, and his mission continues.\n\nOn Aug 1, Mr Debnath, now 39, from Basanti, a deltaic island in West Bengal’s Sundarbans, flew in from Australia. Singapore is his 181st stop.\n\n“I visited schools, colleges and institutions across Singapore talking about HIV/AIDS and spreading the message that prevention is better than cure,” he told\n\ntabla!\n\n. “There are almost 39 million people living with HIV/Aids around the world. I want to tell them that they’re not alone.”\n\nMr Debnath also talks about Indian culture, customs and traditions.\n\n“Whether it is cinema or literature, India has lots to offer,” he said. “(Indian culture) is centuries old and has withstood the test of conquerors and time.”\n\nMr Debnath, who has a degree in zoology from the University of Kolkata and another in fine arts from Kolkata’s Sarbabharatiya university, was inspired to embark on his journey at 14, when he read an article entitled “Aids is more deadly than cancer”. The person referred to in the article was homeless and often sat in front of a medical college in Kolkata, left to die alone.\n\n“I began to ask my teachers at school about HIV/Aids and why this person had to go through so much pain and suffering,” said Mr Debnath. No one could provide a satisfactory answer.\n\n“So, at 16, I began to work and do research on HIV/Aids. I then educated my school, village and community. I followed that up by cycling across my state, my country and the world.”\n\nMr Debnath was also inspired by Indian monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda, who said that “if you want to see the world, see India”, and the Indian globetrotter Bimal Mukherjee, who visited more than 80 countries on a bicycle from 1926 to 1937.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Mr Debnath travelled across India’s 28 states and five Union Territories; 2007-2009 to 23 countries in Asia; 2009-2012 to 50 countries in Europe; 2012-2015 to 52 countries in Africa and eight in the Middle East; 2015-2020 to 48 countries, mostly in South and North America. He even went to Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nIn 2020-2021 he was stuck in New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic. Then he cycled across Australia and Oceania. From Singapore, he will go on to Malaysia and other South-east Asian countries, before returning to India.\n\n“It’s been tough,” said Mr Debnath. “I was held 28 times at gunpoint, robbed 18 times and beaten up.\n\n“The worst was in 2009 when I strayed into Taliban territory in Herat, Afghanistan, 138km from Kabul.\n\n“The Taliban, taking me to be a spy, put me in a dark dungeon for 24 days, before I could prove my innocence. I have a talent for cooking hot, spicy dishes, and I made mutton curry for them. They were impressed and let me go.”\n\nMr Debnath, who has encountered wild animals and other dangerous situations on the road several times, reckons that Europe, Central Asia and South America are the most dangerous regions to travel alone.\n\n“Africa was the finest continent,” he said. “It is poor, but the people are friendly and the most civilised.”\n\nSingapore was a “safe heaven”. “It is so orderly and people are so friendly and supporting,” said Mr Debnath, whose accommodation and food for two weeks was provided by the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board (CSGB). “The young people genuinely care for what I’m saying and love to learn more about India.”\n\nCSGB’s secretary Manmohan Singh found Mr Debnath’s world journey  “incredible”.\n\n“He has lived a simple life without seeking wealth,” said Mr Singh. “This is in line with (founder of Sikhism) Guru Nanak’s teachings.\n\n“We conducted an ardass (prayers) before Mr Somen departed Singapore for the last leg of his monumental journey.”\n\nAfter returning to India, Mr Debnath, whose mother lives in Kolkata, plans to start a global village, probably in one of the northern states.\n\n“I started my journey with just US$17 in my pocket,” he said. “People all along the way have been supporting me, giving me cash or what I need... sometimes flight tickets, equipment.\n\n“I have made so many friends. We have so much to share. In my global village, we will all eat together and come up with creative ideas and be positive in our thoughts and actions.”\n\nMr Debnath has no doubts about the path he chose. “I never planned that I will study, then get a job, marry, bring up children and die,” he said. “I never wanted to lead that kind of life...\n\n“I am super free. My travels taught me to dream, take decisions and be determined, disciplined and dedicated. That is my PhD.”\n\nI was held 28 times at gunpoint, robbed 18 times and beaten up... The Taliban, taking me to be a spy, put me in a dungeon for 24 days... I made mutton curry for them... and they let me go.\n\nMr Somen Debnath.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/297e06a5b54a21c7f1fb6bf6c0208cc6133effdffef8428571621612a891cea7?w=825", "alt_text": "Somen Debnath, who has travelled through 181 countries to spread Aids awareness."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nKerala cricketer Minnu Mani has to thank the sport for turning her life around.\n\nWithin a few months, the 24-year-old all-rounder has shot to fame in her state.\n\nMinnu, from the Kurichiya tribe in Wayanad, worked in paddy fields along with her family members to earn a living.\n\nBut her passion and talent for cricket were noticed by the Delhi Capitals, who bought her for Rs30 lakh to play in the inaugural Women’s Premier League (WPL) in June.\n\nShe became the only player from Kerala to play in the league, which has attracted several stars from England, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nLast month, she also made a successful T20 debut for the Indian national team against Bangladesh.\n\nHer progress in the sport has been exceptional, because Kerala is known as a cricketing backwater.\n\nOnly a handful of players from the state have donned national colours, all men – Tinu Yohannan, S. Sreesanth, Sanju Samson and Sandeep Warrier.\n\nWhat makes Minnu emotional is the love she has been receiving from the people of Wayanad since she grabbed the limelight.\n\nParents in Kerala are now encouraging their daughters to take up cricket and follow in her footsteps.\n\n“I had to face backlash from society as well as my parents when I showed interest in cricket,” Minnu told the Hindustan Times. “Until eighth standard, my parents didn’t even know I was secretly playing local matches.\n\n“I was expected to study and work in the paddy fields and assist my parents in farming.\n\n“Locals are now so excited that someone from Wayanad is playing for India that they want their daughters to learn the sport.\n\n“I have asked the local administration to grant me a small piece of land where I, with the help of my sisters, can build a cricket nursery so that the budding cricketers do not have to travel miles to train.”\n\nMinnu credits her physical education teacher in school,  Elsamma Baby, for unearthing her potential.\n\nThe teacher convinced Minnu to go for the Wayanad Under-13 selection trials despite her parents opposing the idea.\n\nMinnu impressed in the trials and, after a year playing for the Kerala Under-16 team, was fast-tracked to the states’ senior team at age 16.\n\nLast season, Minnu top scored in the Women’s All-India One-day tournament with 246 runs from eight games. She also took 12 wickets.\n\nMinnu, who bagged five wickets in the three-match T20 series against Bangladesh, was the most impressive Indian bowler.\n\nWayanad’s Mananthavady municipality has honoured her by renaming a road junction after her.\n\nThe Mysuru road junction, which will now be known as Minnu Mani junction, is 3km from her house.\n\n“It feels special that they have shown this respect to me,” said Minnu. “I have seen film and political celebrities having roads named after them.”\n\nMinnu, whose father Mani CK is a labourer and part-time farmer, has built a house for the family and furnished it from the money she received from the Delhi Capitals.\n\nShe also bought a scooter to travel and train at the Kerala Cricket Association Stadium, which is more than 50 km from her house.\n\n“BCCI (the Indian cricket board) has changed women’s cricket in India,” she said. “I come from a humble background, but now I can think of buying things for my parents so that they do not have to slog.\n\n“I am happy that my father no longer has to work as a labourer. Now that I have played for India, I can also apply for a job in the Indian Railways.”\n\nA top-order left-handed batter and an impressive off-spinner, Minnu has made it to the Indian team which will play at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, next month.\n\n“Representing India in the Asian Games is a great honour,” she said. “I hope to do well. India has a star-studded batting line-up and my turn to bat usually comes when six wickets are down. But, when I get the chance, I will give my best.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\nMy parents didn’t even know I was secretly playing local matches...

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhile visiting Sri Lanka with a charitable organisation in 2009, towards the end of the civil war there, Singaporean Kalaivani Subramaniam noticed how the decades-old conflict had adversely affected the education of children in the predominantly Tamil-speaking north.\n\nTeenagers did not have access to quality books and lagged behind their peers elsewhere in learning.\n\nBooks donated to them were not always suitable for their education.\n\n“People often passed on books that they did not want to keep,” said Ms Subramaniam, 40, who teaches English language and literature at secondary school level. “For instance, books by Shakespeare were donated, which did not help the children develop elementary language skills.”\n\nShe also observed that there was a lack of English teachers, especially at primary and secondary school levels.\n\nSo Ms Subramaniam, who was then a political science student, decided to set up a mobile library, a modified autorickshaw carrying books for children in Kilinochchi, a town in the north of Sri Lanka.\n\nShe made a sketch of what she wanted the autorickshaw library to look like and passed it to a designer in India who made a prototype.\n\n“It then took more than a year to convert the autorickshaw into a mobile library at a workshop in Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka, and it cost $18,000,” she said. “Donations from my friends and family helped me pay for it.”\n\nDevaartz, an Indian sticker printing company, made the artwork for the mobile library at a very low cost once they realised it was for rural school children in Sri Lanka, she said.\n\n“I carried the huge signboard rolls to Sri Lanka. Many people were very kind in playing their part in their own way,” she said.\n\nAfter searching for suitable books, she chanced upon Thulika, a publisher of English and Tamil books.\n\n“Its  books are simply written and appropriate for basic learners,” she said. “They also  have meaningful themes, such as bravery, loss and disability.”\n\nMs Subramaniam said Kilinochchi’s zonal education director was initially sceptical of her initiative. But she persisted.\n\n“I was determined to carry out my work,” she said. “After three days, he relented.”\n\nStarting in March 2018, the autorickshaw library has been visiting two rural schools a day in the Kilinochchi area, making its way through lumpy, pot-holed roads.\n\nThe books, which can be read within an hour, reach more than 3,000 children a month.\n\nMs Subramaniam spends $300 a month to run the mobile library.\n\n“We have received favourable responses and requests from school principals to continue the project,” said Ms Subramaniam, who has a 10-year-old child.\n\nThough the project came to a halt because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis that hit Sri Lanka, it has resumed this year.\n\nMs Subramaniam hopes to add two more such mobile libraries soon.\n\n“We don’t have to be millionaires to do such social service,” she said. “Simple solutions like this can go a long way in lifting the needy.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6a76080dba4d5d604b3247f646adeebcc86ddae43985c46a7e9ffaab22bb8b1e?w=825", "alt_text": "The autorickshaw library set up by Singaporean Kalaivani Subramaniam in Sri Lanka."}]}

It is taking a much faster, more direct route to the moon and could reach the surface in as little as 10 days, on Aug 21.\n\nOfficials at the Russian space agency Roscosmos have made no secret about their desire to be first to make a soft landing on the moon’s South Pole.\n\nHowever, Luna-25’s journey might take slightly longer, meaning Chandrayaan-3 could arrive on the moon first, reported the BBC.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) seemed concerned about the timing of Luna-25, and its potential impact on orbital space around the moon.\n\nISRO warned that, with the arrival of Luna-25 and nine more spacecraft over the next two years, there would be an increased risk of collisions.\n\nDecades after the original space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, interest in the moon for space exploration has been renewed.\n\nRecent discoveries of ice on the moon have excited scientists, as it could be a potential resource for rocket fuel and even drinking water.\n\nThis new era of lunar exploration involves various countries and private companies, all aiming to explore and potentially establish a human presence on the moon.\n\nThe outcome of this race could shape the future of space exploration, as individual missions contribute to our understanding of the solar system.\n\nNational pride and the desire to prove capabilities in space also play a role in pushing ahead.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1f8e855bdce9977d578598504900fd08dd2e204894d31c341549b973c64b12f0?w=825", "alt_text": "A view of the moon from the Chandrayaan-3 lander during its Lunar Orbit Insertion on Aug 5."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSince the 2013 National Day, many Singaporeans have been singing: “One people, one nation, one Singapore. That’s the way we will be forever more.”\n\nWell, take this with a pinch of salt, as there are several types of Singaporeans.\n\nLet’s start with the famous “kiasu (Hokkien for fear of missing out) brigade”. They are willing to queue overnight for Hello Kitty toys or Taylor Swift concert tickets.\n\n“Kiasuism” is now considered a national trait but there are pockets of other personalities.\n\nPerhaps the largest group after the kiasu brigade is the “Foodies R Us” – they gush about the best outlet, often in a very obscure part of Singapore, at the mention of a dish.\n\nJust nod your head. Contradicting them will lead to a lengthy discussion about ingredients and recipes.\n\nThere’s the “blur type”, who are often referred to as sotong (Malay for squid and slang for bewildered). They have their heads buried so deep in the sand that when they hear of long queues for Taylor Swift shows, they wonder why the people don’t just buy ready-made clothes at the nearest department store.\n\nPerhaps, the most annoying – at least in my book – is the “patriotic type”. They sincerely believe everything in Singapore is simply the best.\n\nI used to know someone in this group. Once, when a foreigner commented that Singapore was very humid, that someone suggested rather angrily that the foreigner return to her home country.\n\nAnother group that can get on your nerves comprise the “complainers”. They always come up with something negative to say.\n\nFor example, if they won $10,000 in the lottery, they would complain about having to go to the Singapore Pools office in Middle Road to collect their winnings.\n\nMany of these complainers have evolved into netizens.\n\nThen, there are the “taiji masters”.\n\nTaiji is an ancient Chinese discipline of meditative movements that look like blocking or deflecting something. Taiji masters are known to divert their duties to their colleagues.\n\nThen there are the perpetual worriers, known locally as kan cheong (Cantonese and Hokkien for nervous, harried or uptight). The littlest issue will have them creating a hue and cry.\n\nTheir opposites are the “jokers”, who will inject humour into almost everything, no matter how inappropriate. They can’t help themselves, it’s in their DNA.\n\nThe good part is that you can’t remain angry with them for long.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1c2a6b73677b2242cfedd4ec09d3baa06e3b1c49579e3d5996b232f0f03e800e?w=825", "alt_text": "A queue for Taylor Swift concert tickets on July 7."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Rajinikanth-starrer Jailer opened in theatres on Thursday.\n\nA Malayalam film with the same title was also scheduled to hit screens on the same day.\n\nBut the Malayalam film’s director Sakkir Madathil backed down on Wednesday – according to media reports, his Jailer will now be released on Aug 18.\n\nHe had earlier been adamant that the Malayalam Jailer would also be released on Aug 10 and even took the issue to court.\n\nThe bitter battle over the Jailer title rights had rocked the South Indian film industry, reported India Today.\n\nMadathil claimed last week that he had requested the makers of the Tamil Jailer to change its title. He reasoned that the Malayalam film is a significantly smaller project and the audience would be confused over the same title.\n\nHe also said the title would confuse the audience and that since the Tamil Jailer features one of the biggest Malayalam stars, Mohanlal, it would be unfair to release the film with the title Jailer and put his Jailer at a disadvantage in the race for ticket sales.\n\nSun Pictures had refused to change the title of the Tamil film, reported Republic World.\n\nMadathil reportedly registered the title Jailer with Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) in 2021 – way before the Tamil film’s title was registered.\n\nBut this too did not have any effect on Sun Pictures, forcing the Malayalam director to file a legal case. A judgement is awaited.\n\nMadathil also said exhibitors are not backing him, giving preference to the Rajinikanth movie. He had asked for a 75-day window but was given only 42 days to screen his film.\n\nHe staged a protest in front of the KFCC office last Friday, demanding that Malayalam films be saved from big-budget films of other languages.\n\nWhen he did not get a response, he announced that he would release his film also on Thursday.\n\nThe Rajinikanth Jailer, also released in Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi and Kannada, bears no resemblance to Madathil’s venture.\n\nWhile the Tamil Jailer is a dark comedy thriller and features Rajinikanth as a prison officer named Muthuvel Pandian, the Malayalam film is a period (1956-57) drama.\n\nCast-wise, there is no competition either. The Tamil film also stars Jackie Shroff, Shiva Rajkumar, Tamannaah Bhatia, Ramya Krishnan and Yogi Babu.\n\nThe Malayalam Jailer has only Dhyan Sreenivasan and Divya Pillai as the main draws.\n\nBut Madathil was confident his film would do better because of its good content.\n\nRajnikanth’s Jailer opened to house-full shows in South India on Thursday.\n\nBuzz around the Tamil film is at an all-time high, as it is Rajinikanth’s first film in two years.\n\nThe Economic Times reported that offices in Chennai and Bengaluru have granted time off for its employees on Jailer’s release day.\n\nRajinikanth had hinted during the film’s audio launch that he is still the superstar in Tamil films.\n\nProducer Kalanithi Maran of Sun Pictures, emphasised that Rajinikanth’s fanbase spans five generations, making him a record-maker.\n\nHe asserted that, until other actors can attract producers as Rajinikanth does, the 72-year-old remains the “only true superstar of Indian cinema”.\n\nIndo-Asian News service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7662feda0057f83d5c505561709b413fdb5c554bb1ff5dd2a9dd2453a5c8a02e?w=825", "alt_text": "Movie posters of (from far left) the Tamil Jailer and Malayalam film with the same name."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRetrenchments in the tech industry have hit many over the years, including 47-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident Palani Pandi, who got laid off in July 2018.\n\nBut the technician did not wallow in his misfortune.\n\nHe immediately looked for a job and found one, but it was something his Nitec certification in precision engineering did not prepare him for – working at a hawker centre and then running his own stall.\n\nMr Pandi’s work at the tech firm would end at 3.30pm each day, so it gave him time to do part-time maintenance work at a hawker centre. Through this part-time job, he made friends with the hawkers and they helped him get a full-time job at hawker centres after his retrenchment.\n\nAfter a couple of years working at hawker stalls, Mr Pandi was inspired to open his own food stall. He took up a one-year lease on a shop and used it to gain working experience before opening Taj Kitchen @ TJ on Feb 23 this year.\n\nThe decision to sell Indian food at the Taman Jurong Hawker Centre stall was not well-received by Mr Pandi’s wife Nadhiya and their two sons, polytechnic students Adheeshwar and Nadesh.\n\nBut they eventually gave Mr Pandi their full support after witnessing his grit and confidence in running his own business.\n\nMs Nadhiya now helps out at the stall and Adheeshwar manages the food delivery apps, payment, Internet banking and design of menu boards. Mr Pandi hired two workers to do the cooking and cleaning.\n\nMr Pandi did not think he would one day be a food stall owner.\n\nIn 1999, he left Karaikkudi in Tamil Nadu to work as a machinist at Jurong Shipyard.\n\nHe became a Permanent Resident in 2004 and enrolled in the precision engineering course, which led him to the job at the tech firm.\n\nMr Pandi enjoys learning new things and picked up conversational Malay while working at the hawker centres. Now he is trying to learn Mandarin.\n\nDespite the initial struggles, Mr Pandi is content with his new career trajectory and is motivated to thrive.\n\n“It was easier working for an organisation that belonged to someone else. I had paid leave, time off and other benefits. I was able to spend quality time with my family,” he said.\n\n“My stall is open from 6am to 10.30pm daily, so the workload is heavy. And running the shop seven days a week means I can’t take a day off.\n\n“But I am working without considering all these problems as I dream of expanding to other parts of Singapore.”\n\n“My stall is open from 6am to 10.30pm daily, so the workload is heavy.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe maps show the roads, the power stations, the lighthouse – but skip all the special spots where generations of Indian fishermen have moored boats or dried their silvery catch, prayed for the living and buried their dead.\n\nSo now the fishermen of Tamil Nadu are learning a whole new skill: mapping their ancient land by app – plot by precious plot – to stop industrial development from swallowing life on a lagoon.\n\n“I am just a fisherman. I knew nothing about mapping. But I had to learn this so that our livelihoods are not destroyed tomorrow,” said Mr Bharath S. Raji, whose family has trawled Pulicat Lake in Tamil Nadu for generations.\n\nSmartphone in hand, Mr Raji navigated the sandy lakeside banks to capture places of special interest – docks, drying areas for nets, shrines to local deities.\n\nHe pointed out the holes left by the government’s latest coastal maps, blank spaces which are villages brimming with life.\n\nWith a new government zoning map three months away, Mr Raji fears his trade and whole way of life will become the next casualty of Lake Pulicat.\n\n“We have always owned the land. But the government keeps changing the rules, not realising that our customs and livelihood here are older than their rules,” said the 33-year-old father of two.\n\nMr Raji and his fellow fishermen of Gunankuppam have captured the coordinates of hundreds of special places on Google Maps and other apps, none of them designated as landmarks in official government maps.\n\nProposals to develop the creek around Gunankuppam label the places the fishermen most cherish as “wastelands”, Mr Raji said, fearing the rapid industrialisation that is transforming much of India is about to take these away from them.\n\nProposals for the creek include a port and power plant, developments that could beach the hundreds of gaily painted boats that trawl the lagoon for mackerel and sea bass.\n\n“The maps released by the Tamil Nadu coastal zone management authority have agitated the fishermen community as they are not detailed,” said Mr Ajay Anand, assistant director of fisheries in Thiruvallur district, a key member in the government agency that will determine the fate of the lake.\n\n“So the fishing community took it upon themselves to do the survey.\n\n“There have been many attempts of industrial encroachment but the local fisherfolk used the maps as a guide to fight them.”\n\nThe fishermen’s maps will be independently cross-checked by the fishing department, Mr Anand said. “Eventually, the government will use the maps prepared by us.”\n\nThe fishing villages around the Ennore peninsula, where the village of Gunankuppam and the lake are located, are caught between India old and new.\n\nAround the creek, fishermen wade through sludgy waters surrounded by foundries, thermal power plants and shipyards.\n\n“Fishermen lose their lives and livelihoods in the process of this development,” said Mr Saravanan K, a coordinator at environmental activist group Coastal Resource Centre.\n\n“Our lands are being used to generate electricity. But we are deprived. The sea, the river – which were sources of our livelihood – are polluted in the process.”\n\nMr Saravanan uses GIS (geographic information system) software – which he learnt from YouTube and a friend who had studied software engineering – to map hundreds of villages in his area. Next, he recruited statewide volunteers to map the land.\n\nYears ago, Mr Raji was among the first three villagers in his area to own a mobile phone, and would travel 20km by road just to pick up a signal with his Nokia.\n\nAccess to cheap smartphones has since skyrocketed, even in the hinterlands, with a billion smartphone users predicted across India by 2026, according to a 2022 Deloitte report.\n\nAnd the fishermen look at past successes to motivate future mapping missions.\n\nThey cite appeals lodged with the National Green Tribual, a government body that enforces environmental protections, that have curbed industrial activities in protected coastal areas.\n\nMr Durai Mahendran, state president of the Tamil Nadu fishermen’s association, credited local mapping efforts with saving his village from a development drive that is reshaping swathes of the fragile coast.\n\nFisherman Dayalan D. is a convert to new technology to preserve his old way of life.\n\n“Whenever the government comes up with a proposal to construct a road or any structure, it is easy for them to encroach on our land,” said the 39-year-old.\n\n“But with the right documentation in the form of maps, we can prove our claims on the land.”\n\nThomson Reuters Founation\n\n“I am just a fisherman.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIt is not every day that Primary 5 pupil Hema (not her real name) gets to eat breakfast.\n\nShe lives in a two-room HDB rental flat with her younger sister and their grandparents in Lengkok Bahru.\n\nThe family of four depends on Hema’s grandfather, who earns about $1,500 as a security guard – enough for only two meals on most days.\n\nHema herself gets $2.80 pocket money each day under the Ministry of Education’s Financial Assistance Scheme. She would sometimes go hungry and feel lethargic, especially after PE lessons.\n\nBut since May this year, 30 primary school pupils from Lengkok Bahru, including Hema, have been benefiting from the Healthy You And Me initiative, which provides the children with a pack of milk and light snacks.\n\nHealthy You And Me was started by residents Elisa Devi Govindasamy and Marlina Mohamed Yased in 2021 and the two mothers work with 15 other volunteers. The ground-up initiative provides aid for the Lengkok Bahru community.\n\nBefore going to school each morning, the children gather outside Ms Marlina’s flat to access the donated milk fridge, tick their name off on the whiteboard and collect a snack.\n\nMs Marlina encourages the children to collect breakfast for consecutive days in a week, after which she rewards them with a small token such as a box of cereal or a pencil case.\n\n“It might not be much, but it helps the children stay alert during lessons. Children who go to school on an empty stomach lose interest in learning,” said the 45-year-old mother of five.\n\nMs Elisa concurred, saying that the beneficiaries, including her own daughter and son who are in primary school, now look forward to waking up early for school.\n\nLocated near Redhill, Lengkok Bahru is an area that consists of six blocks with mostly two-room HDB rental flats.\n\nPublic rental housing is available only for households whose income is $1,500 or less per month.\n\nAccording to a health study conducted by Beyond Social Services in the area, although 42 per cent of the resident interviewees reported having chronic health conditions, many of them thought of seeking medical help as a last resort.\n\nMs Elisa, a 37-year-old single mother, was no different. She discovered in 2021 that she had to undergo a hysterectomy, which costs $7,000 – more than seven times her monthly income of about $900.\n\nThe part-time cashier has been venturing into a home-based online business to supplement her income.\n\nAs a Malaysian on a long-term visit pass for the past 10 years, Ms Elisa was not eligible for government medical subsidies. She believes it was pure luck that a private hospital doctor performed the surgery for free after hearing her pleas.\n\n“Not all our neighbours are resilient, hopeful or even aware enough to seek help for their medical conditions. We wish to change that,” said Ms Elisa.\n\nShe connected with her 12th-storey neighbour, Ms Marlina, who was thinking of creating a support system for the residents during the pandemic.\n\nThey formed Healthy You And Me, starting with a hotline and a one-off free lunch drive for residents struggling with Covid-19.\n\nThe hotline was popular among the residents, with babysitting and healthcare support as the top requests.\n\nMs Elisa and Ms Marlina also created a website (healthyyouandme.netlify.app) to complement their efforts.\n\nThe website and their recently formed TikTok page have been touchpoints for donors to learn about their initiative.\n\n“Sometimes residents just need someone to accompany them to the polyclinic because they feel overwhelmed. Or they need a person to take care of their young children while they are out to attend to an urgent matter. We wanted to address these small needs first,” said Ms Marlina.\n\nConnecting with donors to provide free breakfast for children was inspired by Ms Marlina’s youngest son, nine-year-old Rafieq. He had told his mother that he felt “awake” in school after drinking a packet of milk during recess.\n\nIn a similar vein, Ms Elisa recognised that nutritious food was an issue for Lengkok Bahru parents.\n\nShe was in a similar situation a few years ago – there was once when all she had was $6 in small change. She could on most days serve her children rice, rasam, fried eggs and soya sauce.\n\nHer experience fuelled her drive to make Healthy You And Me work. The initiative relies on donors not only for milk and snacks but also frozen, canned, dried or processed food for the families.\n\nNext to the milk fridge outside Ms Marlina’s flat, there’s a cupboard containing food supplies such as instant noodles, pasta, canned meat and vegetables.\n\n“We sincerely hope that donors continue to support us. It brings us and the young beneficiaries much joy,” said Ms Elisa. “Providing breakfast was a pilot initiative, and we hope we can sustain it.”\n\nOther than coordinating support services, she and Ms Marlina organise social gatherings for the neighbours. The duo hope to foster a close-knit support network for the residents of Lengkok Bahru and broaden their initiative.\n\nThe team is currently working with Mount Alvernia Outreach Medical and Dental Clinic to bring their healthcare services to the residents.\n\n“Sometimes residents just need someone to accompany them to the polyclinic because they feel overwhelmed. Or they need a person to take care of their young children while they are out to attend to an urgent matter.

Jugraj Singh converted another penalty corner in the third-quarter, while Akashdeep Singh hammered the final goal, tapping in a ball from Mandeep Singh in the final-quarter.\n\nIndia finished as the leaders after the group stage encounters, while Pakistan were eliminated from the tournament.\n\nThe result was not much of a surprise as Pakistan, once a major force in world hockey, have been on a downward slide over the past decade.\n\nThey have missed Olympics and World Cups, and fallen to as low as No. 16 in the current world rankings – mainly caused by poor administration, lack of planning and insufficient government support and funds.\n\nThe last time Pakistan won against India, who are currently ranked No. 4 in the world, was at the 2016 South-Asian Games, where India sent a developmental side with little expectations.\n\nIn the last five years, since their Asian Games 2018 face-off, there have been six matches between the two neighbours, with India winning five and one ending in a draw.\n\n“These boys have nothing to lose, they will only learn from it,” said former striker and Pakistan assistant coach Rehan Butt before the match against India on Wednesday.\n\n“Till now, with the little experience that the players have had, they have played excellently. Many are saying that after a long time, Pakistan’s attacking hockey is on show.”\n\nWith an inexperienced side that the Pakistan team management has already declared will be retained at next month’s Asian Games, every game is a learning process for the side.\n\nBut it is also important for the team to play regularly against India to raise their standards and that of Asian hockey, asserted Butt.\n\nIndia captain Harmanpreet endorsed that idea.\n\nAnd with players from both India and Pakistan supporting more games between the two sides, Hockey India (HI) on Wednesday indicated it could look into bilateral matches in the near future.\n\n“There will be more India-Pakistan matches. It won’t happen immediately after today’s game, of course, but it will, at both senior and junior levels,” HI secretary-general Bhola Nath Singh declared.\n\nIf India fail to win gold at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, next month, they will have to play in Pakistan to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe International Hockey Federation last month confirmed that China, Pakistan and Spain will host the Olympic Qualifiers from Jan 13 to 21 next year.\n\nBhola reiterated HI’s stance that the team will travel to Pakistan if needed for the Olympics qualifiers. “The government has made it very clear that there won’t be any problem in major multi-nation events.”\n\n“India’s Sports Minister Anurag Thakur said very clearly that the Indian team will not be stopped from going anywhere to play an important tournament,” he added.\n\n“I don’t think the Indian government will say no to sending a team for such an important tournament as the Olympic qualifiers.\n\n“If needed, I will speak to the government. After all, it is a question of the Olympics. I don’t think there will be any hindrance to this. The rest is up to the Pakistan government and how they organise a tournament.\n\n“How is the security there?

But this was my decision as PM because the political contexts for a minister and a civil servant being investigated and interdicted are different,” he said.\n\nAccording to the Public Service Division, as at 2012, when ministerial salaries were last adjusted, the monthly salary of a minister at benchmark level is $55,000, which works out to an annual salary of $1,100,000. The fixed salary, including the 13th month, is $715,000.

I know he has what it takes to play in a variety of positions, and we are certainly going to benefit from his leadership, aggression and defensive acumen.”\n\nDelvinder, who can play in different defensive positions, made history by becoming Tanjong Pagar United’s youngest captain when he was 18 years old.\n\nSiem Reap-based Angkor Tiger, who finished seventh out of eight teams in the league last year, expect the experienced player to marshal the backline and play a key role in linking the defence and midfield. They hope to make a strong impression in the Cambodian Premier League, which starts tomorrow.\n\nAngkor Tiger, founded in 2015, play at the Hanuman Stadium in the resort town of Siem Reap. They were voted the most popular football club in Cambodia in 2018.\n\nCambodian football has seen a recent resurgence, with its national team finishing just behind regional titans Indonesia and the Philippines in their 2023 SEA Games group.\n\nAt the Under-23 level, Cambodia defeated Singapore 2-1 at Merlion Cup 2023.\n\nCambodia is ranked 176 in the world football rankings – 18 below Singapore.\n\nDelwinder, who got the Cambodia stint through his agent Rookbook Sports, will also be looking to mentor the squad’s young players. He featured in more than 200 Singapore Premier League games for Geylang International, Young Lions, Hougang United, Warriors and Balestier Khalsa. He has been capped five times by the Singapore national team.\n\nFormer Singapore footballer Samuel Benjamin told\n\ntabla!\n\n: “It’s really not easy to get into any overseas team. I am very happy for Delwinder. He is a very versatile player and always wanted to play overseas.”\n\nDelwinder was introduced to football when he was five years old. Having failed to get a spot at Singapore Sports School when he was 12, he joined the Centre of Excellence North Zone.\n\nWhen he was 14, Delwinder again failed the School trials but was picked by coach Abdullah Noor for the National Football Academy Under-15s.\n\nDelwinder played at the Asian Schools tournament in China when he was 16 but an injury in the following year abruptly halted his football journey.\n\nHe was about to hang up his boots for good when former Singapore captain Terry Pathmanathan asked him to join Tanjong Pagar United.\n\n“I am very grateful to Terry. If not for him, I would not have got to play football at professional level,” said Delwinder, who joined Tanjong Pagar United in the 2011 S-League season.\n\nPathmanathan told\n\ntabla!\n\nthat “Delwinder is a very hardworking and disciplined defender”, adding:  “I made him the key player when he joined. He is the kind who would want to prove himself and his level of confidence is great.\n\n“Overseas exposure will be a good experience for him. Playing in Cambodia is going to be a tremendous learning curve. I am impressed.”\n\nDelwinder, who has two brothers, said his childhood dream was to become a police officer.\n\n“But here I am playing the sport I love,” added the Singapore Institute of Management business management graduate.\n\nWhen his agent broke the news about the Cambodia opportunity, Delwinder did not hesitate to accept it despite having to live away from his mother, whom he is very close to. The separation from his family only makes Delwinder even more determined to succeed.\n\n“Football makes one susceptible to injuries and it can be mentally challenging but it teaches you discipline and perseverance,” he said.\n\n“I’m determined to make my family proud.”\n\n“I am delighted to welcome Delwinder (left) to the squad.

With China’s rise, Pacific Islands airfields and undersea cables have again come into play, he added.\n\nChina is PNG’s largest trading partner.

Santosh Kumar\n\nJewish organisation Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) and the Israeli embassy in New Delhi have called out Nitesh Tiwari’s Hindi film Bawaal for trivialising the Holocaust.\n\nThe romantic drama follows a high school history teacher Ajay Dixit (Varun Dhawan) and his wife Nisha (Jahnvi Kapoor) as they go on a Europe tour where they visit prominent World War II sites including Auschwitz.\n\nThe film has lines comparing marital discord to Auschwitz and greedy people to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. It also shows Janhvi and Varun in striped pyjamas at a Nazi camp in a fantasy sequence.\n\nIsraeli ambassador to India Naor Gilon tweeted: “I did not and will not watch the film Bawaal but from what I’ve read, there was a poor choice of terminology and symbolism. Trivialisation of the Holocaust should disturb all. I urge those who don’t know enough about the horrors of the #Holocaust to educate themselves about it.”\n\nIn a scene from the film that was released on Prime Video last Friday, Hitler is used as a metaphor to describe human greed, with Kapoor’s character saying: “We’re all a little like Hitler, aren’t we?”\n\nIn another instance, she says “every relationship goes through its Auschwitz” in a reference to Nazi Germany’s largest concentration camp.\n\nIn a recreation of the horrors at the camp, the couple are dressed in striped clothing and placed in a gas chamber, where they are surrounded by people who are screaming and suffocating.\n\nOn Tuesday, SWC stated that Auschwitz should not be used as a metaphor as it’s a “quintessential example of man’s capacity for evil”.\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, SWC’s associate dean and director of Global Social Action, said: “Tiwari trivialises and demeans the memory of six million murdered Jews and millions of others who suffered at the hands of Hitler’s genocidal regime.\n\n“If the filmmaker’s goal was to gain publicity for the movie by filming a fantasy sequence at the Nazi death camp, he has succeeded.\n\n“Amazon Prime should stop monetising Bawaal by immediately removing this banal trivialisation of the suffering and systematic murder of millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust.”\n\nNetizens are accusing the film of “normalising Hitler’s rule” and for having “spectacularly poor taste”.\n\n“Really don’t understand how this got green-lit. And the gall of Dhawan to engage in whataboutery when questioned,” a netizen tweeted.\n\nAnother wrote: “Gross. The lack of awareness here is staggering. To use the Holocaust as an analogy to a troubled romance? The criticism is more than justified in this case. Bollywood has a sensitivity problem.”\n\nBut the cast and director have called the criticism unwarranted. Speaking at a press junket, Tiwari said Bawaal was made with a lot of “love, care and good intentions”.\n\nHe added: “I’m a bit disappointed with the way some people have comprehended it. That was never the intention. It would never be my intention to be insensitive.”\n\nLeading up to the film’s release, Tiwari had told Press Trust Of India: “I’ve kept the incidents and events, which kind of play an important role in the arc of the characters and their relationships in the movie. Every incident has been carefully chosen. World War II is humongous, there is so much to say.”\n\nKapoor claimed an Israeli professor whose family members died during the Holocaust, praised the film and was not offended by the scenes. “The intention has always been pure,” she said.\n\nDhawan said he respected everyone’s opinion, adding that critics are harder on Hindi movies and give more leeway to Western films.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f122932caf82fde003a2d5fbe9280d5543e538b93603e9d3cc64a705a89742d9?w=825", "alt_text": "Janhvi Kapoor (L) and Varun Dhawan promoting the film in Mumbai on July 24,"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Sikh Advisory Board (SAB) on July 30 commemorated its 75th anniversary with an event that highlighted the Sikh community’s invaluable contributions to nation-building.\n\nThe Singapore Khalsa Association welcomed members, civil servants, dignitaries and community leaders to the celebration of culture, history and harmonious collaboration.\n\nIn his speech, guest-of-honour Lawrence Wong cited the roles and importance of SAB and the Sikh community in nation-building.\n\n“We now have about 13,000 Sikhs fully integrated into our society. Compared to other communities, you may be small in numbers, but your contribution to Singapore is out of proportion to your numbers,” said the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.\n\n“You have all distinguished yourselves in your chosen professions and made significant contributions across diverse fields. Whether it is in the civil service or uniformed services, judiciary, business, sports or many other professions, Sikhs are well represented, excelling and taking on leadership positions.\n\n“From the government’s perspective, we appreciate and value this very close collaboration with the community. In particular, SAB has been instrumental in advising us on matters concerning the community, be it religion, customs or welfare issues.\n\n“The Board has always been candid, open and forthcoming in sharing your perspectives and views on the issues concerning the community. I assure you the government listens to your advice and takes it very seriously.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, SAB chairman Malminderjit Singh said: “The Sikh community is a minority within a minority community in Singapore. Yet we are privileged to be regularly on the minds of government leaders and our partner organisations.”\n\nDuring its 75-year journey, SAB has played an instrumental role in strengthening the bond between the Sikh community and the Singapore government. Its dedicated efforts have contributed significantly to the rich tapestry of Singapore’s multicultural society, making it a crucial element in the nation’s progress.\n\n“Some may say it is a cliche to talk about the importance of racial and religious harmony in Singapore but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be talked about,” added Mr Singh.\n\n“We are at the end of the very first racial and religious harmony month in Singapore, and it is fitting to see that spirit alive in this room. This is a Sikh community event, but we have in our midst our friends from the different faith groups – the SAB’s interfaith family.”\n\nThe 75th anniversary celebration held a deeper significance as it coincided with Singapore’s inaugural Racial and Religious Harmony Month.\n\nThe event underscores the commitment of the Sikh community in promoting multiculturalism and inclusivity, which are integral values at the heart of Singapore identity. Specially curated to reflect the rich heritage and contributions of the Sikh community, the programme included video tributes, cultural performances and a recollection of past SAB initiatives and contributions.\n\nAnd in keeping with the times, SAB launched its new website and a coffee-table book to mark the milestone.\n\n“The book documents the Sikh community’s contributions and tell many stories of nation-building,” said Mr Singh.\n\n“The exhibition and the videos also support these narratives as they can be easily shared online.\n\n“We aim to take the exhibition and the Sikh community to the grassroots like we did four years ago by taking the Sikh Heritage Day to the residents of Tampines.”\n\nThe 75th anniversary celebration was not only a time for reflection and appreciation but also an opportunity to strengthen the multicultural and interfaith harmony in Singapore.\n\n“We now have about 13,000 Sikhs fully integrated into our society.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn his opening speech at the 11th World Tamil Research Conference in Kuala Lumpur,  guest-of-honour Anwar Ibrahim said the event was an example of unity across the political spectrum and that the Indian community in Malaysia had taken the lead in building the nation.\n\n“We have a DAP (Democratic Action Party) guy with an MIC (Malaysian Indian Congress) guy, and with Keadilan (People’s Justice Party) guys clapping. What is wrong? Nothing wrong! We have matured as a nation,” the Prime Minister said before a cheering audience.\n\nBut the July 21-23 Conference was not without its share of bickering and controversies.\n\nIt is not easy to gather an international audience of more than 3,000 to discuss 500 Tamil academic essays.\n\nStarted in Malaysia in 1966 by Sri Lankan Tamil scholar and Roman Catholic priest Xavier S. Thani Nayagam, the Conference discusses the social growth of the Tamil language and aims to unite research scholars.\n\nBut over the years, differences have cropped up among the groups wanting to control it.\n\nThis time the jockeying for power erupted as early as last year when two rival organisers announced two separate locations for the event.\n\nA faction of the International Association of Tamil Research, led by Dr Murugesan Ponnavaiko, Vice-Chancellor of Bharathidasan University in Tamil Nadu, said it would be held in Singapore last year. But it was moved to Chennai after no Tamil organisation from Singapore supported it.\n\nBut the version of the conference in Chennai on July 8 did not receive any submission from Singapore reserchers or writers.\n\nAnother faction of The International Association of Tamil Research led by Dr Marimuthu Thangaveloo, a professor of social psychology at Universiti Malaya, initially said the conference would be held in Dubai last year. But it announced in April that the venue was changed to Malaysia because of economic constraints.\n\nWith each faction accusing the other of usurping the leadership of the association, several Singapore-based Tamil organisations chose to stay away from the conference that was held at the Universiti Malaya in Kuala Lumpur last month. They had also stayed away from the July 8 event in Chennai.\n\nBut Singapore writers M. Anbalan, N. Andiappan, M Elias and Rathina Vengadesan submitted four essays at the Kuala Lumpur conference helmed by Dr Marimuthu.\n\nThe days leading up to the conference also saw another controversy.\n\nOnline reports said the decision to allow Malaysia’s Education Minister V. Sivakumar to deliver the welcome speech was not accepted by Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) deputy leader M. Saravanan. The supporters of both leaders nearly came to blows over the issue.\n\nFinally, their differences seemed to have been resolved and they shared the stage to give welcome speeches at the opening ceremony.\n\nBut just the day before, another controversy erupted when Tamil Nadu’s Dalit leader and president of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi Thol Thirumavalavan remarked on stage that, unlike Christianity and Islam, Hindu philosophy runs contrary to equality and brotherhood.\n\nHis remark drew the ire of the audience, with some calling for Mr Thirumavalavan to be removed from the stage.\n\nMalaysia’s Deputy Minister for Entrepreneurship Development and Cooperatives Saraswathy Kandasami intervened, calling for tolerance while rebuking Mr Thirumavalavan for his utterances.\n\nThe conference, which was funded to the tune of one million ringgit by the Malaysian government and supported by businessman and philanthropist O.M.S. Thiagarajan, was attended by more than 1,500 delegates from Malaysia alone. Four hundred came from India and the rest from other countries – including the 75 delegates from Singapore, led by businessman Harikrishnan Muthusamy.\n\nFormer Nominated Member of Parliament R. Dhinakaran gave a speech entitled “Tamil in the Singapore Government”.\n\nMs Kandasami told\n\ntabla!\n\nthat she was heartened to see the delegates from Singapore. Describing Indian Singaporeans as the “umbilical kin” of Indian Malaysians, she said “Singapore’s participation in the Conference can be seen as a renewal of the relationship”.\n\n“We have a DAP (Democratic Action Party) guy with an MIC (Malaysian Indian Congress) guy, and with Keadilan (People’s Justice Party) guys clapping.

Santosh Kumar\n\nStrong winds blew over Changi Naval Base amid a light drizzle as I stepped aboard the INS Ranvijay for a reception on Sept 21.\n\nThe Indian Navy\n\n(IN)\n\nship and its accompanying vessels were in Singapore to participate with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) in the 30th edition of the annual Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise (Simbex).\n\nThe mood on the deck was convivial. Jovial discussions overflowed among the RSN guests and their Indian hosts over welcome drinks and snacks that included paneer masala and mutton balls. Whoever cooked those dishes should be rewarded for having entrenched the gastronomic dimensions of India’s Act East policy.\n\nOn the formal front,\n\nIndian High Commissioner Shilpak Ambule placed Simbex in the context of the enduring and expansive nature of bilateral ties. (It holds the distinction of being the longest continuous naval exercise that the Indian navy has carried out with any country.)\n\nCaptain Saikat Chatterjee, defence adviser at the Indian High Commission, looked on\n\ncontentedly\n\n, his office having been instrumental in ensuring that Simbex 2023 would be\n\noff to\n\nall smooth sailing.\n\nDinner followed, but I had to leave. It was a wistful moment\n\n. It was sad to be\n\n, leaving a ship that is a microcosm of India.\n\nThe INS Ranvijay’s officers and other sailors are drawn from diverse parts of India. They have different mother tongues and faiths, and come from varying educational backgrounds and economic strata of society, but they are united by a seamless sense of being Indian and a deep pride in their professionalism.\n\nThey know that India’s global naval footprint depends on how well they and their colleagues elsewhere in the Indian navy can turn nationalism into professionalism.\n\nI remembered the historian and strategist Kavalam Madhava Panikkar. He emphasised in A Survey Of Indian History the maritime possibilities of Indian power by drawing a distinction between the oceanic and coastal varieties of Indian sea-consciousness.\n\n“The only Indian State which had a proper appreciation of sea power was the Chola empire” because it possessed naval self-consciousness that made possible an “oceanic policy, not just a coastal awareness of the economic and military importance of the waves washing ashore”, he wrote.\n\nThat oceanic policy led to the establishment of bases in Nicobar and the assertion of territorial authority over the coastal areas of Malaya. The Cholas’ punitive expedition against the Srivijaya kingdom, a foray which included the capture and temporary occupation of Kadaram (modern Kedah) in 1025, represented the zenith of Indian naval credibility in what is South-east Asia today.\n\nThe colonial period witnessed the contraction of Indian maritime power. The Indian Maritime Doctrine of 2015 acknowledges the valour of the Zamorins of Calicut in their fight against the Portuguese in the early 16th century and the tactical successes of Maratha navies against European warships in the early 18th century.\n\nUltimately, however, Indian states “could not take the battle against the European navies beyond littoral waters. While they successfully chased them away from the Indian coast time and again, the extra regional blue water navies remained free to operate in the waters of the northern Indian Ocean. With sea control of these waters firmly in European hands, the domination of these colonial powers over India’s maritime trade – and subsequently, even on its sovereignty – ensued in logical progression.”\n\nYet, even within the colonial dispensation, the most enlightened of rulers recognised India’s military potential. Lord Curzon, the British Viceroy of India from 1898 to 1905, wrote in 1909: “The central position of India, its magnificent resources, its teeming multitude of men, its great trading harbours, its reserve military strength, supplying an army always in a high state of efficiency and capable of being hurled at a moment’s notice upon any point either of Asia or Africa – all these are assets of precious value.”\n\nThat vision has led scholars to call for a “neo-Curzonian” foreign policy based on the centrality of India’s dealings with major powers, in order to seek leverage from East Africa to Pacific Asia, on the strength of India’s ability to retain enough of a “military surplus” to be a security provider in an extended neighbourhood.\n\nThat is a good idea. Of course, only the foolish would call for India to replicate the imperial ambit of the Cholas or the colonial ambitions of the British. Imperialism never lasts. Colonialism ends not only with the loss of empire but with the contraction of the original national self, as witnessed by the post-colonial decline of Europe. What is expected of India instead is a desire to play a countervailing role against attempts to disturb the stability of Asia’s strategic architecture.\n\nStructural rivalry among the great powers over the future of the global order threatens to split the Indo-Pacific region, which stretches from America’s Pacific coastline to the Indian Ocean and is home to more than half of humanity, accounts for nearly two-thirds of the world’s economy, and hosts seven of the world’s largest militaries.\n\nIn this volatile context, Singapore’s adherence to an open, rules-based international order advances not only its own interests but also those of all countries that depend on multilateralism for the peaceful resolution of territorial and other disputes.\n\nIndia, on its part, believes in the contribution of a free and open Indo-Pacific to the equitable evolution of the world order.\n\nUnfortunately, not every country is satisfied with the status quo in the Indo-Pacific. Revisionist attempts are underway to alter the prevailing order, not least by attempts to draw seas into exclusive spheres of influence. Countervailing stability demands an anchor somewhere.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4711cd358a255704cf790f7950bc93ba674b36e3447c5d236e6f85c37d95d87c?w=825", "alt_text": "RSN Commander, Seventh Flotilla, Col Fong Chi Onn (seated, right) and India’s Commodore Sumeet Singh Sodhi signing an operations agreement as Indian High Commissioner Shilpak Ambule and RSN Fleet Commander Col Kwan Hon Chuong look on."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nLearning one’s mother tongue should be a joyful experience, and it should be more relevant to people, said President Tharman Shanmugaratnam at a Teachers’ Day Dinner gathering on Sept 23 at the HomeTeamNS @ Khatib hall.\n\n“In learning mother tongue languages, the singular objective should be making it a joyful experience,” he said.\n\n“Integration of Tamil language and culture is one way in which learning Tamil can be made joyful and authentic.”\n\nHe recommended using teaching techniques that draw students in naturally, such as songs (particularly rap), movies, videos and games.\n\n“Make it joyful. Make it relevant to their lives. Make it something they hum on their own. I think that’s the right approach,” said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe added that while curriculum changes throughout the years made a lot of sense, they also worry him a bit because there shouldn’t be more objectives for language teaching and learning.\n\n“We should not burden mother tongue teaching and learning with too many objectives,” he said.\n\nMr Tharman also pointed out that the fundamental challenge is the same for all the mother tongue languages, which is their declining usage at home.\n\n“The challenge is precisely because we have our ethnic integration policy in our neighbourhoods and schools. This policy is completely essential for Singapore. But it is a special challenge for Tamil language teaching and learning as there are fewer opportunities to use the language in daily life,” he said.\n\nGuests at the event hosted by the Singapore Tamil Teachers’ Union (STTU) included Mr Vikram Nair, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee\n\n(TLLPC)\n\n; Mr Ng Chee Meng, Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress; and 470 Tamil teachers.\n\nMr Tharman said: “We have to start much earlier by getting young children interested in the language by offering authentic learning opportunities. STTU reaching out to the pre-school teachers is an excellent idea.”\n\nHe also lauded STTU for putting Singapore on the global map in Tamil language teaching and learning.\n\n“Now you are among international leaders trying to advance Tamil teaching and learning, especially in other countries where Tamils are a minority. You have converted a challenge in Singapore into an opportunity,” he said, citing former STTU leaders such as Mr S. Samikannu, Mr A.R. Mashuthoo and Mr V.R.P. Manickam as deserving of credit.\n\nA new leadership team led by Mr Danapal Kumar is now taking the effort forward.\n\nMr Tharman commended Tamil teachers for their dedication and creativity in preserving the language and the various bodies working together to help students enjoy using the language beyond the classroom.\n\n“Twenty years from now, the Tamil language will be a vibrant part of Singapore’s multicultural identity,” he said.\n\n“Make it joyful. Make it relevant to their lives. Make it something they hum on their own. I think that’s the right approach.”\n\nSingapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0044ccb8f0e533aafec5101b9f86b09b4eedfa006af2a3fa545c6a380a63d69d?w=825", "alt_text": "President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his wife Jane Ittogi arriving at the Teachers’ Day Dinner."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nOn the bustling streets of Chennai, a chance encounter between content creator Mohamed Ashik and an elderly beggar has touched hearts and illustrated the profound impact of compassion and generosity.\n\nMs Merlin, an 81-year-old from Myanmar, once led a very different life. She married an Indian man and moved to Chennai, but fate dealt her a series of heartbreaking blows. Most of her family members died, leaving her alone, struggling to make ends meet.\n\nBut a heartwarming story unfolded when she met Mr Ashik.\n\nWhat began as a casual conversation soon revealed Ms Merlin’s remarkable fluency in English, a skill honed during her earlier years as a school teacher in Myanmar.\n\nMr Ashik was moved by Ms Merlin’s story and decided to make a difference in her life, reported India Today.\n\nHe gave her a sari and, more importantly, asked her to start providing English tuition, offering to pay her to make content in English. True to his word, Mr Ashik started the Instagram page English With Merlin.\n\nMs Merlin’s story struck a chord with netizens and the video starring Merlin paati (grandmother) has reached almost 30 million views on Instagram, reported NDTV.\n\nNot only did millions of people start to follow her account @englishwithmerlin, but some also helped her reconnect with her former landlord’s family who saw to it that Ms Merlin had a spot at an old-age home\n\nin Royapettah\n\n.\n\n“I spotted Merlin paati near Besant Nagar beach on Sept 9. I recognised her from a previous video in which she had asked the content creator for a blouse because the one she was wearing was torn. So, I gave her a sari and a blouse, but I couldn’t leave it at that,” Mr Ashik told The News Minute.\n\n“During our conversation, she corrected my pronunciation and said that she was an English teacher. I didn’t want her to beg. So I thought of creating an Instagram page where she could teach.”\n\nSince then, Mr Ashik has uploaded reels of Ms Merlin teaching basic conversational English and narrating stories for children.\n\nMs Merlin said she migrated to India in 1996 after her marriage and was forced to live on the streets following the death of her husband, son and mother-in-law.\n\n“Since 2018, I have struggled on the streets for day-to-day activities like bathing or using a public toilet. I have been sleepless on several nights,” she told The News Minute.\n\nMs Merlin said she was also featured in the videos of other content creators who offered help. “Some gave money, others helped with old clothes, food and medicine, while some even offered to get me mango juice.”\n\nMs Ashik’s viral video helped Ms Merlin reconnect with her old landlord’s family.\n\nMr Logu Padmanabhan alias Shyam, the landlord’s son who used to attend her tuition classes as a child, reached out to her after seeing the video.\n\n“With the help of my friend Dinesh Kumar from (leading Tamil entertainment website) Behindwoods, I went searching for Gama (short for grandmother). When we found her, I spoke to her and helped her recollect who I was. Dinesh recorded it on his phone and eventually published it,” Mr Shyam told The News Minute.\n\nMs Merlin said she was shocked to see Mr Shyam. “I was surprised that he still remembered me and came all the way to see me. He was more than a student to me, he is like my grandson,” she said.\n\nWhile Ms Merlin’s daughter lives in the city, she is not in a position to extend support, according to Mr Shyam.\n\n“We located some of her other relatives but Gama preferred to go to an old-age home,” he said.\n\nWith the help of Uravugal Trust’s Khaalid Ahamed and Mr Dinesh, Ms Merlin was moved into the old-age home, in Royapettah in central Chennai. “I am happy and peaceful here,” she said.\n\nMr Shyam’s medical officer wife monitors Ms Merlin’s health and their family is looking to take Ms Merlin to live with them once their house construction is complete.\n\n“From 1996 to 2003, Gama’s family and mine lived as one. That was eight whole years. It is unfortunate that she was living on the roads.

Next to Bava is Mr Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, who was the guest of honour.\n\nPHOTO: TABLA!\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nSingapore’s rugby team put up a brilliant show 45 years ago. They won the Malaysian Rugby Union Cup in Kuala Lumpur in 1978,\n\nrecording a shock win of 19-3 victory over\n\nbeating the Malaysian Armed Forces 19-3.\n\nIt was Singapore rugby’s best performance under coach Natahar Bava, winning a tournament after 44 years of participation under the previous label of Singapore Civilians.\n\nLater that year, Singapore took part in the Sixth Asian Rugby tournament in Kuala Lumpur and emerged with their best result to this day – a third-place finish behind powerhouses Japan and South Korea.\n\nGiving credit\n\nto the deeds\n\nfor these performances, the Singapore National Olympic Committee crowned player Song Koon Poh Sportsman of the Year and awarded Bava Coach of the Year. The 1978\n\nteam\n\nsquad was also recognised as Team of the Year.\n\nLast Sunday, the team’s exploits were recalled at a dinner attended by most of the team members and friends of rugby at Amara Hotel. There were speeches and tales from the golden period of Singapore rugby.\n\nMost of the stories that came out that night were new to many of the 110 attendees, including Bava’s grandsons Matteo Rinaldi, 22, and Lucas Rinaldi, 20, both school-level rugby players.\n\nThe boys had heard that their grandfather, now 77, was an inspirational leader. But they knew very little about what the 1978 team did and how they did it.\n\nLeow Kim Liat, the first captain of an all-Singaporean national team, formed in 1972, said there are valuable lessons to be gleaned.\n\n“It is a story of how anything is possible with hard work and passion. I think it is important to show that rugby in Singapore has a storied history,” said the 73-year-old.\n\nSong, who is still fit at 69, said: “It was a team that was quite unique. We played for each other, for the love of the game and country.”\n\nAnd that is the message Bava hopes gets through to Singapore’s young rugby players, like his grandsons.\n\n“In the era of professionalism, this team carries an important message – playing for your country is the ultimate aspiration of any athlete,” he said.\n\n“Commitment, determination and devotion to the country were key elements in our 1978 victory.”\n\nBava added that the current generation must commit themselves to improving their skill and fitness levels. “They must reach a point of enjoyment, only then can they propel themselves to the top.”\n\nFormer The Straits Times sports editor Godfrey Robert, who wrote the book We Were Kings about the 1978 team, said: “What I witnessed in KL was beyond imagination.\n\n“First, our focused and determined effort bringing down the much bigger (average weight 95kg) and taller (1.82m) Royal New Zealand Forces with tackles\n\nbordering on\n\nof grit and guts in the semis, then outrunning and outwitting the Malaysian Armed Forces in the final.\n\n“The team’s biggest strength was supreme fitness built over runs at Mount Faber, and this saw them last until the final, when other teams faded towards the end.\n\n“Teamwork was also the key as the boys played for each other, and carried the team spirit throughout.”\n\nMatteo, a former ACS(I) rugby team vice-captain, said it was very inspirational listening to the 1978 team members and his grandfather, “especially because I was coached by Lincoln Tan, who was my grandpa’s\n\nprodigy\n\nprotege”.\n\nThe chemical engineering student at NUS added: “My grandpa went to all the games I played and would give me advice at the end. He would tell me what to focus on and motivate me even when we lost.”\n\nLucas, who is finishing NS this year, said he is very proud of his grandfather’s efforts and the 1978 team’s win.\n\n“It is great to see the team meeting again,” he said.  “The camaraderie and fire are still there.”\n\nThe 1978 team members meet every five years to keep the spirit going.\n\n“The fellowship and support for each is still very strong. For us, it’s about the love of the game,” said Leow.\n\n“Back then, we had to buy our own boots, shorts and food. We never had the kind of facilities that are available now.\n\n“It was an honour to play for Singapore.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/51262c3332f230b3002a7872fa4e91fa2abe36cab5a4c7d0c30499c07043e8a7?w=825", "alt_text": "Natahar Bava handing the rugby ball to his grandsons Matteo (wearing glasses) and Lucas Rinaldi at the dinner attended by most members of the 1978 team.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Singapore men’s cricket team have fallen from a world ranking of 19 to 36 – their lowest in a long time.\n\nThe ongoing Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, is an opportunity to start the climb back up\n\n, maybe even to the top\n\n. It may take three to four years if everything goes to plan.\n\nAs chairman of selectors, I feel cautiously optimistic about the Asian Games side. Never have we had a collection of this many talented cricketers in a squad.\n\nRegardless of how the team finishes, this can only augur well over time.\n\nFor the first time, the Singapore Cricket Association has employed a Singaporean coach.\n\nChaminda Ruwan is not only an exceptional cricketer himself, but he also has the trust and respect of the players. He has a good understanding of the challenges they face and how to make optimal use of scarce resources.\n\nIn the batting department, there is experience and class in Anish Paraam, who can rank alongside any first-class cricketer. Singapore can also lean on him for his mean off-spinners.\n\nHe is ably supported by the likes of Rezza Gaznavi, Arjun Mutreja and Chetan Suryawanshi, who will likely shoulder the wicket-keeping responsibility, too.\n\nOther young batting talents include Rohan Rangarajan and Abdul Rahman Bhadelia.\n\nIn Raoul Sharma and Navin Param, the youngest of the cricketing Param brothers, Singapore has two exciting prospects who played key roles in the SEA Games success earlier this year.\n\nAman Desai, who previously captained Singapore’s junior squad, is the second wicketkeeper and a promising bat.\n\nAryaman Uchil, Janak Prakash and Avi Dixit form Singapore’s fast-bowling trio, capable of troubling the best of batsmen when on song.\n\nAahan Achar and Anantha Krishna are the two spinners who on their day can turn a game on its head. They are supported by young Ishaan Sawney, who is also a promising batsman.\n\nThe team’s strength lies in its all-roundedness, giving it the ability to bat all the way down to 11.\n\nI am not at all guaranteeing that the team is going to come back with a medal. This is the Asian Games and every powerhouse in Asian cricket will be represented by some of their great\n\nop\n\ntalents.\n\nBut our team will play its best cricket and give the opponents a run for their money.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/07a3a5fe08784f4a4667a48b768519224ee2473f29cb890a8e9b0ec96f5e3f04?w=825", "alt_text": "Anish Paraam oozes experience and class."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nVastu Shastra, an age-old Indian architectural practice, delves into the science of arrangement and positioning to harness positive energies within compact living spaces.\n\nIf you are a modern dweller seeking tranquillity and balance in your cosy abode, these Vastu tips can guide you:\n\nEmbrace the entrance:\n\nEnsure that it is well-lit and clutter-free. Opt for soft, warm lighting that is welcoming. Incorporate elements like a decorative doormat or a piece of traditional art to invoke positive energy as you step inside.\n\nCommand of the quarters:\n\nPlace your study or work desk in the northern or eastern corner to encourage productivity. A bedroom in the south-west corner promotes restful sleep and emotional stability.\n\nThe heart of harmony:\n\nPlace the stove in the south-east corner of the kitchen to ignite passion in your culinary endeavours. Keep the kitchen clutter-free and well-ventilated, allowing positive energy to flow freely.\n\nBountiful balconies:\n\nMake good use of your balcony. Decorate it with potted plants and soothing elements to create a serene outdoor oasis. Positioning plants in the north-east corner brings prosperity and growth.\n\nThe power of colours:\n\nOpt for soft, earthy tones like pastel greens and calming blues to create a soothing atmosphere. Bright, vibrant colours can be used in moderation to add a touch of energy to the space.\n\nThe mirrored illusion\n\n: Mirrors are known to reflect and amplify energy. Placing mirrors strategically can make your compact space feel larger and more open. Avoid placing mirrors directly opposite the entrance, as they might bounce positive energy away.\n\nLight the way:\n\nAdequate lighting is crucial for positive energy flow. Natural light is the best source, so try to maximise it through well-placed windows. For artificial lighting, opt for warm and diffused lights that create a cosy ambiance.\n\nDeclutter and simplify:\n\nKeep your living area tidy and organised. Embrace minimalistic decor that not only creates a sense of space but also allows for better energy movement.\n\nArt of arrangement:\n\nArrange furniture in a way that encourages easy movement while maintaining a harmonious balance. Avoid blocking doorways and passages, as this obstructs the flow of energy.\n\nSacred spaces:\n\nCreate a small corner for meditation or contemplation. This space can double as a reading nook or a place to unwind. Position it in the north-east corner of your living area for maximum positive energy.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e0a190545e98167103e717fab6e2b5bce2f7df9d1531b93da55974085337a34d?w=825", "alt_text": "Vastu Shastra delves into the science of arrangement to harness positive energies."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nInterest rates for the Special and MediSave accounts (SMAs) of Central Provident Fund (CPF) members will go up by 0.03 percentage point to hit 4.04 per cent per annum for the 2023 Q4, the CPF Board and the Housing Board said in a joint statement on Thursday.\n\nInterest rates for CPF Special, MediSave up\n\nThe rate hike is due to an increase in the 12-month average yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities, which the SMAs’ interest rates are pegged to.\n\nInterest rates for the Ordinary and Retirement accounts will remain at 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively for 2023 Q4.\n\nNUS staff reminded to ‘differentiate truth from falsehoods’\n\nStaff from the National University of Singapore (NUS) were reminded on Wednesday to avoid violating Singapore’s laws after a website was issued a correction order for carrying a faculty member’s article that contained false statements.\n\nNUS president Tan Eng Chye wrote in an email to staff that the university has a collective duty to safeguard a high level of trust from the public, which stems from its position as a leading global university.\n\nThe Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act office had directed academic website East Asia Forum to put up a correction notice for the article A Spate Of Scandals Strikes Singapore by NUS Assistant Professor Chan Ying-Kit.\n\nNTUC reiterates call for flexible work arrangements, paid caregiving leave\n\nThe labour movement has reiterated its call for paid caregiving leave to be made mandatory and for employers to provide more flexibility in work arrangements, to support workers shouldering caregiving responsibilities.\n\nThe National Trades Union Congress said on Wednesday that this will help caregivers continue to work and take care of their loved ones.\n\nThese were some of the recommendations it made following its year-long public engagement exercise called #EveryWorkerMatters Conversations.\n\nCar COE premiums hit new highs, Open category rises to $144,640\n\nThe certificate of entitlement (COE) prices for cars and the Open category hit record highs on Wednesday, spurred by motor dealers rushing to meet year-end targets and take advantage of current tax rebates for electric cars.\n\nThe COE premium for cars with engines up to 1,600cc and 130bhp, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) up to 110 kilowatts, was 3.96 per cent higher at $105,000, up from $101,000 at the last tender exercise.\n\nThe premium for the Open category COE – which can be used for any vehicle type except motorcycles, but ends up being used mostly for bigger cars – also set an all-time high, at $144,640.\n\nNUH turns to AI to shorten waiting times for emergency patients\n\nKnowing when there will be a surge of patients at the emergency department and whether there are beds available will allow the National University Hospital to allocate manpower easily.\n\nSo the hospital’s Emergency Department has turned to Pathfinder, an artificial intelligence project that provides real-time insights into waiting time and bed occupancy rates, which can guide staff in decision-making within a chaotic emergency environment.\n\nEV early adoption scheme extended till 2025\n\nAn initiative encouraging the early adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) through rebates has been extended till Dec 31, 2025, but with a lower maximum rebate in 2024.\n\nUnder the EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme, owners who register new fully electric cars and taxis will continue receiving rebates of up to 45 per cent off additional registration fees.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/singapore-news-in-brief-1562270?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nVeteran screenwriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar has insisted that the iconic Bollywood film Sholay was not based – as rumoured – on a classic Western, Sergio Leone’s Once Upon A Time.\n\n“As I have said, Salim Khan and I were influenced by Leone but Sholay was not based on his epic film. Critics have also drawn a parallel between Zanjeer and Dirty Harry,” Akhtar said in the recently released book Talking Life: Javed Akthar In Conversation With Nasreen Munni Kabir.\n\nHe pointed out that Dirty Harry was released in December 1971 and Zanjeer in May 1973. It would have been impossible in the pre-Internet days for the screenplay to be copied and the movie shot, edited and released in such a short time.\n\n“It is all rubbish. No film was a remake or based on any other film,” said Akhtar, adding that Zanjeer was Khan’s brainchild.\n\n“Salim and I wrote the screenplay together. Yes, Dirty Harry was remade in Hindi but it was not us. It was called Khoon Khoon and turned out to be a big flop.”\n\nAkhtar also pointed out that the only similarity between Zanjeer and Dirty Harry was the profile of the heroes – two angry police officers.\n\n“I think the Zanjeer hero has more layers,” said Akhtar.\n\n“Whenever some Indian film critics saw a film of ours, they assumed it had to be a copy and couldn’t believe we could think up ideas ourselves.”\n\nLast year, Akhtar stirred controversy when he claimed Dharmendra rejected Zanjeer and that “Amitabh Bachchan was actually the last choice for Zanjeer”.\n\nHe told India Today magazine: “Everybody refused to do this film. I can understand why.\n\n“It was a time when Rajesh Khanna was considered god, music was a must in films, and Zanjeer offered neither romance nor comedy. The hero didn’t sing, he was a very grim, serious, bitter person. It was different, so everybody refused.”\n\nDirected by Mehra, Zanjeer is one of the blockbusters in Bachchan’s career and it earned him the moniker Angry Young Man for his role as Inspector Vijay Khanna, who sets out to avenge his parents’ death after getting suspended.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/21947e39d5d0e25dd775b146ea644b3fb7d4ea3cb32c21a39f0690d7e4139ebe?w=825", "alt_text": ""}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nCanada this week divulged it had intelligence possibly linking Indian government agents to the murder of a separatist Sikh leader – the kind of news that usually sparks uproar among democratic allies. Not this time.\n\nIndia is being courted by the United States and others as a counterweight to China, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s rare attack just days after the G20 Summit in New Delhi is putting Western nations in an awkward position.\n\n“India is important in Western calculations for balancing China, and Canada is not,” said Ottawa’s Carleton University professor of international relations Stephanie Carvin.\n\n“This really puts Canada offside among all other Western countries.”\n\nMr Trudeau announced on Monday that Canada was “actively pursuing credible allegations” that Indian agents were potentially involved in the murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June.\n\nAt that point, Ottawa had already been discussing the matter with key allies such as those in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance, which also includes the US, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe results have been muted. Britain refused to publicly criticise India and said bilateral trade talks would continue as planned. Indeed, a statement from Foreign Secretary James Cleverly about the affair did not mention India by name.\n\nBritain is in a difficult position, caught between supporting Canada and antagonising India, a country it wants as a trading partner and ally to help confront China, said India expert Chietigj Bajpaee of the Chatham House think tank in London.\n\n“Short of there being any definitive evidence of India’s involvement, I think the UK response is likely to remain muted,” he added. A free trade deal would be a “major political win” for both India and Britain.\n\nWhite House National Security Adviser John Kirby said the US was “deeply concerned” and encouraged Indian officials to cooperate in any investigation. India rejected the idea it was involved in the murder.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Mr Trudeau had pushed for a joint statement condemning India at the Group of 20 summit and was turned down.\n\nMr Kirby said “any reports that we rebuffed Canada in any way whatsoever are false, and we will continue to coordinate and consult with them on this”.\n\nThe muted response to Mr Trudeau’s allegations is stark when compared to the uproar after Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by nerve agent in England in 2018.\n\nBritain, the US, Canada and others threw out more than 100 Russian diplomats to punish Moscow for an attack it has always denied carrying out.\n\n“Our Five Eyes partners are understandably reluctant to really wade into this, given everybody’s interest in advancing ties with India, in the context of the ongoing tension with China,” said Mr Wesley Wark of the Centre for International Governance Innovation think tank in Waterloo, Ontario.\n\n“It’s a bit of a waiting game. If the Canadians come up with very solid evidence about egregious Indian state involvement in an assassination attempt, I think we’ll hear more from our allies in support,” he said.\n\nWith allies unwilling to contemplate any kind of joint condemnation of India, the Canadian options now look limited – at least until it can provide incontrovertible evidence.\n\n“If we don’t get our allies to support this, Canada’s not going to be able to do a great deal to move India,” said former Canadian Security Intelligence Service head Richard Fadden.\n\n“And I think the greatest thing we can aspire to in the short term\n\nor term\n\nis to get India not to do this again.”\n\nThe diplomatic row escalated on Thursday when India’s official visa processor, BLS, in Canada said that it had been told to stop handling applications, before taking down the notice.\n\n“Important notice from Indian Mission: Due to operational reasons, with effect from 21 September 2023, Indian visa services have been suspended till further notice,” BLS International had posted on its website.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from India’s foreign ministry.\n\nReuters\n\n“India is important in Western calculations for balancing China, and Canada is not.

He built relations and businesses with other countries and put our nation in good stead for the future.”\n\nAs Mr Lee’s personal security officer from 1970 to 1990, Mr Kandasamy was posted to Mr Lee’s 38 Oxley Road residence. He was\n\nalso\n\nthe longest-serving member of Mr Lee’s security detail.\n\n“I learnt a lot from Mr Lee as I kept a close watch on him. Those were the best years of my life,” said Mr Kandasamy.\n\n“Mr Lee was firm but never lost his temper at me. He was always looking around and would put other people to the test. I learnt what I had to do as I stood by his side.\n\n“I don’t know how or why I outlasted the other security officers. Maybe Mr Lee trusted me and his family had faith in me. I also got along well with Mr Lee’s personal secretary, whom I chatted with every day.”\n\nHe also believes it was fate.\n\nMr Kandasamy, who grew up in Jurong, said he was\n\nmost\n\nprobably the first boy from the neighbourhood to attend Victoria School at Tyrwhitt Road. The Veterans Football Club founder recalls playing football – something he was good at – with his friends and how he enjoyed his school life.\n\nUntil he was told that he was in trouble.\n\n“I asked, ‘For what?’” said Mr Kandasamy, recounting his conversation with a close friend when he was in Secondary 4.\n\n“He told me, ‘Gangsters in our area have targeted you. They want you to be the extortion collector, go to every shop, collect money and give it to the leader.’\n\n“I came from a poor family, my father was a rubber-tapper and mother a grass-cutter. So, after hearing what my friend said, I had no choice but to join the police force – something we could do from Secondary 3 onwards in those days.”\n\nMr Kandasamy, who was a sharp-shooter and fitness buff, made instructor at the police training school when his constable peers were posted to different divisions.\n\n“Perhaps the top officer saw something in me,” he said.\n\n“One Monday, he called me and told me to report to the police headquarters. I was sent to the Security Command, bodyguard department.\n\n“‘You’re going to be a bodyguard,’ the officer told me. I underwent training before my posting to 38 Oxley Road. I had no idea what my future would hold but that was the beginning of some of the best years of my life.”\n\nMr Lee was already a well-known figure at the time but “he was never an authoritarian”, said Mr Kandasamy.\n\n“He set the highest standards, both in the office and at home, but never\n\npushed\n\nthrew his weight around. To me, he was a perfect gentleman.\n\n“He is one man who, to the best of my knowledge, has done so much for Singapore. He never thought of only himself or his family. To him, Singapore was priority No. 1, then maybe came his family.\n\n“His heart was with Singapore and Singaporeans all the time. Whatever Mr Lee did, he did it for his people and country.”\n\nMr Kandasamy recalled how Mr Lee would always finish his work before going to bed. He would wake up early the next morning and exercise.\n\n“Come rain or shine, Mr Lee would exercise. He made sure he did his exercises around the Istana grounds every day, even on holidays.\n\n“There was one time Mr Lee returned from an overseas trip only at midnight but he still completed his exercise routine,\n\n– golf, jog, swim, run, cycle, push-up and step-up –\n\nincluding jogging, swimming and cycling, the next morning.\n\n“He was also careful with what he ate. It was usually a simple meal of white rice, vegetables and fruits. He ate chicken, beef or fish only\n\non\n\nevery other day.”\n\nMr Kandasamy decided to\n\nhang up his hat\n\nend his stint on Aug 15, 1990 – the eve of his 50th birthday.\n\n“I told Mrs Lee I was retiring and she said I had to tell the Prime Minister. At 11am, as we were taking the lift to the office, I told Mr Lee about my decision.\n\n“After we exited the lift, he put his bag down and asked me ‘why’. I told him that I had exceeded my retirement age by five years and had to go.\n\n“He asked me: ‘How old are you?’\n\n“I told him I was 50 and he said, ‘What? You are 50? You don’t look like it.’\n\n“He then asked if I had another job waiting and I said I did, to which he replied: ‘Well, if you have to go, you have to go.’”\n\nThe rare, brief exchange was a display of Mr Lee’s professionalism, said Mr Kandasamy.\n\n“Nobody is indispensable. When I left, someone else would take over my position. It’s a fact of life.\n\n“I was called up by my Police Security Branch boss the next day and he gave me one of the best birthday presents – a signed testimonial by Mr Lee.”\n\nThe handwritten testimonial read: “He was my personal security officer since 1970. He was keen, alert and quick. He anticipated my movements and was unobtrusive in the manner he covered me. He is also helpful, resourceful and courteous. I commend him to anyone looking for a reliable and trustworthy personal security officer.”\n\n“Getting this great testimonial from a great man is more than a dream come true,” said Mr Kandasamy.\n\n“I took on other jobs but never used the testimonial as leverage. I framed up the testimonial, the proof that I worked for one of the greatest men of the 20th century.”\n\nMr Kandasamy worked as a protocol officer at Changi Airport VIP complex over the next 14 years before joining a transport company. He and his wife Anapurini, 77, are still working at a taxi company.\n\nThe couple lost their older son due to health issues several years ago and now live with their second son and his family in Pasir Ris.\n\n“Life has been good,” said Mr Kandasamy, who gets to maintain his financial independence with his salary and pension.\n\n“I thought if I were gone, nobody would suffer a loss except my dear wife. But if my leader were gone, millions of people would suffer.”\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew’s personal bodyguard Karuppiah Kandasamy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8cc9c7ac34fde974c4f5058d7fbf3d12cd0452214cb4a72e920667a3ce24a0e7?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Karuppiah Kandasamy (with his hand on the car) guarding Mr Lee Kuan Yew when the Singapore leader visited Manila for an Asean heads of government meeting in the mid-1980s."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/47010f2c0c5bc76d6d23a9e1aed548d06f4d1ff13764daef8ffc9875865ce7bc?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Karuppiah Kandasamy (with his hand on the car) guarding Mr Lee Kuan Yew when the Singapore leader visited Manila for an Asean heads of government meeting in the mid-1980s."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8cc9c7ac34fde974c4f5058d7fbf3d12cd0452214cb4a72e920667a3ce24a0e7?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Karuppiah Kandasamy (with his hand on the car) guarding Mr Lee Kuan Yew when the Singapore leader visited Manila for an Asean heads of government meeting in the mid-1980s."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/47010f2c0c5bc76d6d23a9e1aed548d06f4d1ff13764daef8ffc9875865ce7bc?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Karuppiah Kandasamy (with his hand on the car) guarding Mr Lee Kuan Yew when the Singapore leader visited Manila for an Asean heads of government meeting in the mid-1980s."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8cc9c7ac34fde974c4f5058d7fbf3d12cd0452214cb4a72e920667a3ce24a0e7?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Karuppiah Kandasamy (with his hand on the car) guarding Mr Lee Kuan Yew when the Singapore leader visited Manila for an Asean heads of government meeting in the mid-1980s."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTen-year-old Sherief worked at a book-binding unit on Mint Street in Chennai, making Rs15 (25 cents) a day. He had to turn the wheel of the paper cutter, which sometimes left him with blisters on his hands, reported The Times of India.\n\nAt the end of the week, he would get Rs90, most of which he would give to his parents. The rest he would spend on watching movies.\n\nNow 33, Sherief is a movie director and his maiden venture Ranam, a Tamil mystery thriller starring South Indian actor Vaibhav Reddy, will be released next month.\n\nSherief told The Times of India that his journey from child-labourer to filmmaker was not easy.\n\nHe grew up in Washermanpet, a Chennai suburb now known as Vannarapettai, where his father Gows Moideen delivered water cans and mother Meera was a tailor.\n\nThe family’s circumstances saw Sherief drop out after Class 5 to start work.\n\n“Some of my friends had already started to work during the summer holidays, so I too decided to work,” he told The Times of India.\n\nBut the volunteer teachers at a nearby evening tuition centre intervened.\n\n“My teachers at the evening school, Chithra, Selvi and Dhanam, came to my house and spoke to my parents. My mother wanted me to continue my studies. They said the fees at government-aided schools would be less and I was enrolled at St Agnes School in Broadway.”\n\nSherief worked part-time on weekends, pasting posters of magazines and movies screened at Bharath, Maharani and MM Theatres.\n\n“I used to go to work at 3am to avoid being spotted by friends. I got 50 paise to Rs1 for pasting a poster. I bought notebooks with the money,” he said.\n\nThe Arunodhaya Centre for Street and Working Children also stepped in.\n\n“They organised meetings twice a month for rehabilitated children,” recalled Sherief.\n\n“We would discuss bad roads, mosquitoes and the lack of street lights. We were also trained to write, sing and play instruments. I wrote plays about child labour and directed skits.”\n\nAfter school, Sherief studied animation and visual communication, before joining the film industry. He worked in music, art direction, cinematography and film production.\n\nRanam, which was written during the pandemic, will portray characters Sherief met in his life. The investigative thriller also stars Tanya Hope, Nandita Sweta and Saraswathi Menon.\n\n“Ranam revolves around a murder mystery,” Sherief told The New Indian Express.\n\n“Vaibhav will play a facial reconstruction artist, and one of the cases he takes up changes his life.”\n\nVaibhav plays a rugged character, unlike the roles the actor has done previously.\n\nRanam’s tagline reads “Aram Thavarel”, taken from 1st-century BCE Tamil poet Avvaiyar’s Aathichudi, a collection of single-line quotations.\n\n“Aram Thavarel means that one should never let go of an opportunity to do a good deed,” said Sherief.\n\n“The hero gets one such opportunity, and the effect of his decision forms the rest of the story.\n\n“I wanted someone who had never done a thriller to be the hero of Ranam. Vaibhav fits the role perfectly, as he was also on the lookout to do something new.”\n\nBacked by Madhu Nagarajan of Mithun Mithra Productions, Ranam has music by Arrol Corelli, cinematography by Balaji K. Raja and editing by Muneiz.\n\n“Sherief has achieved his childhood dream of becoming a movie director despite many hurdles,” said Arunodhaya Centre executive director Virgil D. Sami.\n\n“He is a role model and inspiration to underprivileged children.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“I used to go to work at 3am to avoid being spotted by friends.

Husain, V.S. Gaitonde, Jamini Roy and F.S. Souza at the auction.\n\nIt was only last month that the 1989 Gestation, also an oil on canvas, was sold at Rs51.75 crore by Pundole’s auction house in Mumbai, becoming the most expensive Indian artwork sold at auction.\n\n“The record price achieved by Sher-Gil’s The Story Teller is an important milestone in the Indian art market and testament to the artist’s immense skill and enduring legacy as one of India’s art treasures,” said Saffronart CEO and co-founder Dinesh Vazirani.\n\nTouted as one of the 12 works selected by Sher-Gil herself as her most important works, The Story Teller is widely considered an example of the artist’s most honest and expressive compositions. The dominant subjects for the eminent artist are women, primarily because she could lend her empathetic self most easily to their condition.\n\nThe painting was first exhibited at Sher-Gil’s solo exhibition at Faletti’s Hotel, Lahore, in November 1937.\n\nHer other well-known portraits of women include Three Girls, Women On The Charpai, Hill Women and Young Girls.\n\nBorn to an Indian father and Hungarian mother on Jan 30, 1913, in Budapest, Hungary, Sher-Gil came to be known as one of the greatest avant-garde women artists.\n\nFrom the early age of five, she immersed herself in drawing and painting with watercolour. Her early works consisted of vibrant illustrations of Hungarian fairy tales with captivating characters. In 1921, the Sher-Gil family moved to India and settled in Shimla.\n\nIt was there that she honed her observational skills, capturing the essence of those around her through meticulous sketches. She died at the young age of 28 in 1941.\n\nIn 1976, Sher-Gil was declared by the Archaeological Survey of India as one of India’s nine National Art Treasure artists.\n\nThe auction also smashed a few other records.\n\nRenowned painter and art educator K.K.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMoving past her disappointing show at July’s World Fencing Championships in Milan, Amita Berthier is focused on getting a podium finish at this month’s Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\n\nThe foil fencer, who will be Singapore’s flag-bearer alongside wushu exponent Jowen Lim, claimed a historic bronze at June’s Asian Fencing Championships in Wuxi, China.\n\nShe hopes to do just as well or better at the Sept 23-Oct 8 Asiad.\n\n“I have my eyes set on the podium,” the 22-year-old told tabla!.\n\n“After breaking that milestone in Wuxi for myself and Fencing Singapore, I’m itching to get that medal. It’s not going to be easy but I look forward to it and will give my best.”\n\nCompeting in the individual event at July’s World Fencing Championships, Berthier lost 15-10 to Maia Weintraub of the United States in the Round of 64, while the Singapore women’s foil team lost 45-35 to Egypt in the Last 32.\n\nDespite not performing up to her own expectations, the three-gold SEA Games medallist is staying positive as she targets a medal in Hangzhou and direct entry to next year’s Paris Olympics as one of the top two fencers in the Asia-Oceania region.\n\n“I was just a bit disappointed with my results at the World Championships because I had one of the best preparations of my life but didn’t get the result I expected,” said Berthier.\n\n“I just remind myself that it doesn’t mean I’m not a good fencer, ups and downs are a nature of the sport.”\n\nManaging expectations and dealing with disappointments are some things she has been working on with a sports psychologist. She also has a strong support system that includes her family.\n\nBerthier’s Olympic debut in Tokyo 2020 “helped relieve some pressure” as she ticked the competition off her checklist of milestones.\n\n“It’s my determination and the belief that I deserve to be on the podium that are driving me. And working with my coach, who had trained Olympic gold medallist Lee Kiefer, definitely boosts my confidence.”\n\nTo prepare for her medal hunt in Hangzhou, she has been training in the US with her University of Notre Dame coach Angad Khazbak and Ines Boubakri.\n\nThe 34-year-old Boubakri, who made history by winning Tunisia’s first Olympic fencing medal with her foil bronze at Rio 2016, retired after the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n“I’ve never worked with someone who has retired but I think it has worked out very well,” said Berthier.\n\n“Ines went up against the same opponents I compete with, so the information, advice and experience that she shares with me give me an advantage.\n\n“She’s also left-handed, so she can see things from my perspective.”\n\nTraining under two coaches, Berthier gets to draw from a mix of fencing styles.\n\nWhile Khazbak’s style is more aggressive and focuses on fencing from a distance, Boubakri specialises in the French style, with priority on technique and closer sparring distance.\n\nAt the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, Berthier and teammates Maxine Wong, Tatiana Wong and Melanie Huang won a team foil bronze – it was Singapore’s first fencing team medal at the event.\n\nShould she get a podium finish in Hangzhou, Berthier will be just the second Singaporean fencer to win an individual medal at Asiad. Lim Wei Wen clinched an epee bronze at the 2014 Incheon Games.\n\n“Obviously the goal is to be on the podium and I don’t think it’s out of reach for me,” said Berthier.\n\n“I need to stop looking at top 16 or 8. At every competition, I need to believe that I can make the podium because I have beaten some really good fencers.

The film will hit theatres on Sept 28.\n\nIn the clip on X, the mother-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: “It is really touching. I do understand the role of a woman, who is also a mother, wife and career person. Speaking from experience, it is all very hard to balance but some people are fortunate. In my case, I lived above my parents, so I got help. All these women in The Vaccine War did not have that.\n\n“It is not easy for a woman to do well in her career with her children. She needs good family support. I always say that behind every successful woman, there is an understanding man.\n\n“In this film, the children are small but they will be proud of their mother and what she has done. They will not understand Covaxin but this film really shows the effort and the selfless work the scientists do, so that we all can live in a democratic India, happily and healthily. That is a very important message.”\n\nMrs Murty said Agnihotri has shown that “real wealth lies in confidence” and all Indians should “unleash their potential”.\n\n“Be proud that you are Indian. Be proud that you are Bhartiya,” she added.\n\n“For thousands of years, we have been slaves. We lost our identity, courage and capacity. We have tremendous potential but it is not unleashed because we are always worried we cannot do it.”\n\nShe said: “Many people say, ‘We can’t do it,’ but we can. Not only in the medical field but in any field.\n\n“You should believe in yourself – beauty is not in the dress, money or make-up. Your beauty is in your courage and confidence.\n\n“If you have self-belief, that is the real beauty, the real money. You (Agnihotri) have shown here that the real wealth is in your confidence.”\n\nAgnihotri is known for directing The Tashkent Files (2019) and The Kashmir Files (2022).

Santosh Kumar\n\nIdealists are not known to be pragmatic, and vice versa. But the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew bridged the divide admirably.\n\nIt was his hard-nosed pragmatism and instinct for survival that defined him in the eyes of the world. Very few observers noticed his idealistic traits.\n\nTo mark his birth\n\nanniversary\n\ncentenary on Sept 16, tabla! looks at the legacy of independent Singapore’s founding father, who died eight years ago at the age of 91.\n\nMr Lee was Singapore’s first prime minister, holding office from 1959 to 1990, and is credited with transforming a rather shabby former British colony into a flourishing global hub of commerce, innovation and progress.\n\nPaying tribute to Mr Lee’s achievements, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X: “His visionary leadership played a key role in Singapore’s transformation. His foresight and relentless pursuit of excellence are testament to his personal greatness. His work continues to inspire leaders worldwide.”\n\nWay back in 1963, the consensus was that Singapore was too insignificant to be a nation by itself. It had no natural resources, no hinterland – just a deep-water port – so it merged with the Federation of Malaysia.\n\nTwo years later, Singapore was booted out.\n\nThe Vietnam War was then raging amid the Cold War rivalry between the United States and\n\nthe Russia-China blo\n\ncommunist countries such as the Soviet Union and China.\n\nGiven these circumstances, it would have been more logical and pragmatic for Mr Lee to align Singapore\n\nto\n\nwith one of these sides rather than risk trying to survive on its own.\n\nBut he\n\nrealised his dream of\n\nled the newly independent nation successfully by combining his ideals with a uniquely Singaporean blend of very pragmatic social and political measures.\n\nMr Lee believed that people don’t pine for democracy. Rather “they want homes, medicine, jobs, schools”, he said in the 1998 book Lee Kuan Yew: The Man And His Ideas.\n\nSo he and his team of stalwarts that included Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr S. Rajaratnam, Mr E.W. Barker and Dr Toh Chin Chye focused on economic development.\n\nTogether, they built a world-renowned port, a famous airline and an excellent education system, and attracted a host of multinational companies to invest here.\n\nLiving standards rose and the government built extensive public housing, where about 80 per cent of Singaporeans now live – the vast majority in their own homes.\n\nMr Lee also realised that Singapore needed the means to defend itself.\n\nHis government introduced\n\ncompulsory\n\nconscription and made a military career appealing even to the Chinese community that lived by the proverb: “Don’t waste good iron for nails or good men for soldiers.”\n\nAll the while, he tempered his idealism with practical considerations and found that good intentions could be costly and have unintended consequences.\n\nFor example, he said this of welfare: “I soon realised that before distributing the pie, I had to first bake it. So I departed from welfarism because it sapped a people’s self-reliance and their desire to excel and succeed.”\n\nAs I was born here in 1953, I grew up when Mr Lee was at the helm. I attended the highly-subsidised schools and the hospitals were excellent. I also enjoyed the peace and prosperity ensured by what some people called the government’s authoritarian policies.\n\nI did run afoul of the ban on long hair for males that was implemented in the 1960s.\n\nThe campaign was to stem the growing popularity of the hippie movement that the government considered as a bad foreign influence.\n\nI was 17 years old and was returning by train from Kuala Lumpur. Although it was about 8pm, there was a government officer waiting in ambush at the Tanjong Pagar railway station.\n\nHe decided that my hair was too long and marched me off to get it trimmed at the station’s barber shop.\n\nTo add insult to injury\n\nOh, and I had to pay for the haircut.\n\nOther penalties for defying the long-hair ban included fines and being served last at government offices and facilities.\n\nThe rule even applied to foreigners and famous bands, such as Bee Gees and Led Zeppelin,\n\nwhich\n\nwho cancelled performances in the city state.\n\nThe campaign lost steam in the late 1980s with the gradual acceptance of long-haired men and the disappearance of the hippie culture.\n\nTo be fair, Mr Lee did not do all these single-handedly. There were others who shared similar ideals and helped him.\n\nBut there is no doubt that Mr Lee is the main author in crafting the Singapore brand.\n\nPerhaps the best proof of his idealism is his admission that Singapore was an “improbable, unlikely nation”.\n\nHe also said: “My greatest satisfaction comes from… mustering the will to make this place meritocratic, corruption-free and equal for all races – and that it will endure beyond me.”\n\nThank you, Sir, for making it all happen.\n\n“My greatest satisfaction comes from… mustering the will to make this place meritocratic, corruption-free and equal for all races – and that it will endure beyond me.”\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c85144d5ae1c6edc4b1467df6a760f551bbd4b0cfe8629093dfa94f68305efe2?w=825", "alt_text": ""}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe fortunes of Singapore’s men’s hockey team at this month’s Asian Games largely rests on a family whose oldest member Krishnan Vijayan Naidu, 58, is the coach.\n\nHis second son Dineshraj, 25, is a dashing forward while Hariraj, 23, is a utility player (someone who can play in any position as needed).\n\n“It’ll be difficult for Singapore to get a podium finish as there are world-class teams in the fray,” said former Singapore coach Rajan Krishan, a Malaysian who was at the helm from 2016 to 2020.\n\n“I was the one who brought Vijayan’s sons into the national team when they were teens, as they showed impressive pace and discipline. Both started as forwards and have matured to be dependable players for Singapore.\n\n“The Asian Games will be a good experience for them as they will get to play against some of the top players. They will be better prepared for the future.”\n\nSingapore are drawn against Pakistan, Japan, India, Bangladesh and Uzbekistan in the preliminary pool at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, from Sept 23 to Oct 8.\n\nCurrently, ranked ninth in Asia, they have a realistic chance of finishing seventh or eighth if they beat the weaker teams in the pool, Bangladesh and Uzbekistan.\n\n“Anything is possible,” said Vijayan, who took over as Singapore’s men’s team coach in 2020.\n\n“We have a bunch of young boys raring to go. At the Phnom Penh SEA Games in May, we finished with a silver, achieving our goal to better our bronze-medal showing at the 2017 SEA Games in Malaysia.”\n\nVijayan, who has been involved in Singapore hockey for 47 years and played for the national team at the 1991 Intercontinental Qualifiers and 1992 SEA Games, added that he puts extra pressure on his sons to deliver on the field.\n\n“There is no outside coaching. What I give everybody else in the team, I give them too,” he said of Dineshraj and Hariraj, who are both former St Andrew Secondary students.\n\n“Both have good attitude and discipline. With self-belief, there’s increased confidence. Both have tremendous speed and will give their all for the national team.\n\n“I did not force them to take up hockey. They picked it up on their own for their co-curricular activity. Of course, they also saw me play hockey and wanted to follow suit.”\n\nHariraj was a good rugby player when he switched to hockey in school. “I took up hockey for fun but soon realised I was good at it. My school coach Paramjit Singh and my father shaped my play,” he said.\n\nVijayan said Hariraj, who will be pursuing a degree at PSB Academy, can be very demanding of his teammates. “But I have told him to control himself as other players may not be of the same level, so he should focus on his own game instead.”\n\nDineshraj is\n\ncurrently\n\npursuing a degree at the University of Western Australia in Perth and turns out for the UWA Hockey Club.\n\n“I’m still learning. Along with my technical skills, I also have to build my mental strength. The hockey in Perth is of a high standard and I get to play against some of the top Australian players,” he said.\n\nHis oldest brother Darshanraj, 31, is\n\ncurrently\n\na coach understudy to their father. He switched to coaching after he could not break into the national team.\n\nIn recent years, Darshanraj guided Chongzheng Primary School and Huamin Primary School to National School Games titles.\n\n“My father gives me a format to follow. I fine-tune it to make it intense for the boys,” he revealed.\n\nIt was also through hockey that Vijayan met his wife Thanam, 61. He was a coach at Ceylon Sports Club, where she was a player.\n\n“I played decent hockey until age 27, when our first boy was born,” said the sister of former Singapore football international V. Khanisen. She is now a senior shipping executive.\n\n“I played as a centre-forward for West Hill Primary School and Naval Base Secondary School,” she said.\n\nHockey dominates the conversations in the Naidu household, which has many photos from their local and international outings.\n\n“I’m immensely happy that my family is into hockey, each with his own individual talents,” said Thanam.\n\n“I will be rooting for team Singapore when they take to the field in Hangzhou.”\n\n“Anything is possible.

My dream of making India a football nation is still alive.”\n\nAccording to media reports, Stimac was in touch with astrologer Bhupesh Sharma to seek his opinion on team selection during the Asian Cup qualifiers in May and June last year.\n\nThe Indian Express quoted Stimac as saying the astrologer “was recommended to me and I was convinced that I have to check upon his possible effects in sports”.\n\nThe newspaper also quoted the All India Football Federation’s then secretary-general Kushal Das, who confirmed that he introduced Stimac to Sharma.\n\nDas said there were concerns over whether India would qualify for the Asian Cup: “It was not a comfortable situation. For me, the most important thing was that India should qualify.”\n\nThe report quoted Das as saying that AIFF paid Sharma Rs12-15 lakh ($20,000-$25,000) for two months’ services. “That didn’t seem like a huge amount since India qualified for the Asian Cup,” said Das.\n\nThe Indian team played four matches – a friendly against Jordan and three Asian Cup qualifiers against Cambodia, Afghanistan and Hong Kong.\n\nWhile India lost the friendly against Jordan 2-0 in May, they won their three Asian Cup qualifiers to finish top of their group and qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup.\n\nStimac and Sharma had exchanged almost 100 messages during the period.\n\nThe newspaper report claimed – based on the exchanges – that Stimac would run possible team selections and injury updates past Sharma and incorporate his inputs when finalising the playing squad.\n\nThe report also said two established players did not make the starting XI against Afghanistan on June 11 because their stars were not favourable.\n\nIn recent developments, AIFF announced that Stimac will not be the coach of the Indian team at this month’s Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.

Santosh Kumar\n\nA Seattle police watchdog agency has launched an investigation into bodycam footage showing a police officer joking about the death of a 23-year-old Indian student who was hit by a speeding police patrol car earlier this year, media reports said.\n\nJaahnavi Kandula was killed in January after she was struck by a police vehicle driven by officer Kevin Dave. He was driving at 119kmh as he rushed to check on a report of an overdose, The Seattle Times newspaper reported on Monday.\n\nIn the bodycam footage released on Monday by the Seattle Police Department, officer Daniel Auderer laughed about the deadly crash and dismissed any implication that officer Dave might be at fault or that a criminal investigation was necessary.\n\nIn the clip, officer Auderer, the vice-president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, was in a call with the guild’s president Mike Solan. He laughed several times and at one point said: “Yeah, just write a cheque, US$11,000 ($15,000). She was 26 (sic) anyway – she had limited value.”\n\nOfficer Auderer said that Dave’s vehicle had been “going 50” and that “that’s not out of control,” NBC News reported.\n\nA police investigation report referred to prosecutors for review last month said that officer Dave was driving at 119kmh and Ms Kandula’s body flew more than 30m from the impact.\n\n“That’s not reckless for a trained driver,” officer Auderer said in the video, adding that he did not believe she was thrown that far either, the report said.\n\n“But she is dead. No, it’s a regular person,” he added and laughed.\n\nOnly officer Auderer’s side of the conversation was audible in the bodycam footage.\n\nIn his defence, officer Auderer said he made the comment to mock lawyers, according to KTTH radio station in Seattle.\n\nHe noted that Mr Solan “lamented” the young woman’s death during the two officers’ initial conversation, adding that it was unfortunate that her death would “turn into lawyers arguing the value of human life”.\n\n“I responded with something like: ‘She’s 26 years old. What value is there? Who cares?’ I intended the comment as a mockery of lawyers,” officer Auderer was quoted as saying.\n\n“I was imitating what a lawyer tasked with negotiating the case would be saying and being sarcastic to express that they shouldn’t be coming up with crazy arguments to minimise the payment.\n\n“I laughed at the ridiculousness of how these incidents are litigated and play out as two parties bargain over a tragedy.”\n\nAccording to the report, officer Auderer acknowledged that anyone listening to the body-camera recording “would rightfully believe I was being insensitive to the loss of human life”, and said the comment “was not made with malice or a hard heart”.\n\nThe Office of Police Accountability confirmed that an investigation had been initiated after the agency received a complaint on Aug 2 from an employee with the Seattle Police Department.\n\nThe oversight agency, which investigates police misconduct and recommends discipline to the police chief, is investigating the context in which the statements were made and whether any policies had been violated, the police department said.\n\nThe Indian government has urged the US to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\nThe Indian Consulate in San Francisco said the handling of Ms Kandula’s death in a road accident was “deeply troubling” and sought action against those involved in the case.\n\n“We have taken the matter up with local authorities in Seattle and Washington State as well as senior officials in Washington DC for a thorough investigation and action against those involved in this tragic case,” the mission wrote on X.\n\n“The consulate and embassy will continue to closely follow up on this matter with all concerned authorities.”\n\nMs Kandula, from Andhra Pradesh, was pursuing her master’s degree at Northeastern University in Seattle, according to a GoFundMe fundraiser launched to support her family.\n\n“The family has nothing to say. I wonder if these men’s daughters or granddaughters have value. A life is a life,” said her uncle Ashok Mandula.\n\nAnother Seattle police oversight organisation, the Community Police Commission, described the audio as “heartbreaking and shockingly insensitive”.\n\n“The people of Seattle deserve better from a police department that is charged with fostering trust with the community and ensuring public safety,” it said in a press release.\n\n“Especially in light of this video, the hard work towards ensuring the Seattle Police Department reflects the values of the community it polices and embraces transparent accountability, will remain a top priority for the Seattle Community Police Commission.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“Yeah, just write a cheque, US$11,000 ($15,000).

Santosh Kumar\n\nStreets lined with beautiful flower pots, colourful paintings and posters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed foreign leaders and delegates to New Delhi over the last weekend.\n\nAs thousands of people from across the globe arrived in the Indian capital for the G20 Leaders’ Summit on Sept 9 and 10, the Indira Gandhi International Airport operated with exceptional efficiency, giving every traveller a seamless experience.\n\nThe leaders met at the new Bharat Mandapam, which featured a monumental 8.2m Nataraja statue that was made in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDelegates were served sumptuous free-flowing vegetarian food.\n\nAt the event venue and\n\nall collaterals were\n\nelsewhere, the designs incorporated the lotus – India’s national flower as well as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s\n\nlogo\n\nsymbol.\n\nThe show-piece event not only focused on India as a\n\nn important\n\nglobal power and Mr Modi as a significant world leader, but also served as a platform for the Indian PM to engage the domestic audience ahead of parliamentary polls next year.\n\nThe use of Bharat instead of India in the name tag in front of Mr Modi during the sessions created a buzz among the journalists\n\nseated\n\nat the media centre beside the Bharat Mandapam. They took out their phones and cameras to record the scene.\n\nDays earlier, there was commotion in India when President Droupadi Murmu’s dinner invitation\n\nhad\n\nused the\n\nword\n\nname Bharat instead of India.\n\nLeaders and their spouses who attended the G20 Summit were treated to a dinner\n\nmade\n\nwith millets served on silver- and gold-plated\n\ndinner\n\ntableware, showcasing India’s rich tradition, culture and diversity.\n\nIndia’s presidency of the G20 comes at a time of uncertainty, with the tensions between the United States and China as well as the war between Russia and Ukraine taking centre stage.\n\nAmid these contentious points, India pulled off a successful summit, with a joint communique agreed upon by all members on the first day itself.\n\nThrough the year of India’s presidency, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has been a sticky point, with many doubting if India could get all together and make a joint declaration. Without condemning Russia for\n\nits actions\n\nwhat it did and not\n\ncalling\n\ndescribing it as aggression, a communique\n\npermissible by\n\nacceptable to all parties was reached\n\nin seven paragraphs\n\n.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong described the declaration\n\n, which spanned 10 chapters,\n\nas comprehensive and covering a lot of ground. “India had a very difficult job as president of the G20. The international environment is just uncertain,” he said.\n\n“I think we did well to have a communique and a meeting where substantial issues were discussed and views aired, and a certain sense of the mood is created on many of these issues.”\n\nThe G20 also saw the landmark addition of its 21st permanent member – the African Union.\n\nThe organisation representing 55 African countries will join the Group of Twenty, which meets to discuss economic and political issues as well as climate change and sustainable energy.\n\nIndia’s theme for its G20 presidency was Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (Sanskrit for One Earth, One Family, One Future). Much emphasis was\n\naccorded to\n\nput on food security, climate change and sustainable energy at the summit.\n\nSpeaking at the first session, titled One Earth, PM Lee put forth three ways in which Singapore is tackling climate change.\n\n“We believe new technologies, financing models and markets offer us hope. All these require international collaboration, which the G20 can and should provide leadership for,” he said.\n\nMr Lee called for like-minded partners to work together to diversify Singapore’s power mix and realise the potential of low-carbon hydrogen, mentioning that Singapore has developed a National Hydrogen Strategy to green its power sector.\n\nHe also reiterated the need to catalyse more private funds at scale to crowd-in and complement public capital as trillions of dollars of annual investments are required for the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nEmphasising the need for governments to work together to create a conducive environment for the decarbonisation investments, PM Lee stated Singapore’s support for multilateral approaches towards mitigation goals.\n\nHis speech at the third session, titled “One Future” was also a call for multilateralism and the need to refresh the mandate and laws of multilateral organisations, such as the World Trade Organization, to keep to the times.\n\n“WTO rules need to keep pace with digital transformation and remain relevant for the modern economy,” said PM Lee, urging that the G20 provide a “strong impetus to advance negotiations on WTO reform, in particular to restore a fully-functioning dispute settlement system as soon as possible”.\n\nThe leaders also visited Raj Ghat to pay their respects at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial and participated in a tree-planting ceremony.\n\n“We believe new technologies, financing models and markets offer us hope.

The mistakes were blindingly obvious. For instance, Malaysia’s flag represented Singapore and the Philippines’ flag was used for Vietnam.\n\nAfter discovering the errors, the news channel made the necessary corrections and issued an apology.\n\nSuch boo-boos occur even at the largest international sporting events.\n\nAt the London Olympics in 2012, the South Korean flag was displayed next to the player profiles of the North Korean women’s football team.\n\nThe North Korean team stormed off the pitch but returned after profuse apologies from the organisers to win 2-0 against Colombia.\n\nI wonder what may have happened if the North Koreans had lost.\n\nThat same year, the parody national anthem from the 2006 comedy film Borat was mistakenly played at the medal ceremony instead of the Kazakh national anthem at the 2012 Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix.\n\nA year later, the Ukrainian organisers played the Russian national anthem for the Ukrainian medallist at the 2013 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships held in Ukraine.\n\nAs expected, all hell nearly broke loose.\n\nThe takeaway is that we cannot be too careful when it comes to matters dealing with a country’s identity or political leaders.\n\nYou can check, double-check and even get a second pair of eyes and ears, but then there will still be occasions when Murphy’s law will prevail.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f2b8b1f265db0cc918bc72782244b16968b9e0871eba99f3111b4d946853a70d?w=825", "alt_text": "PM Lee Hsien Loong attending the wreath laying ceremony along with other G20 leaders at Rajghat, New Delhi."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nPolice in Haryana on Tuesday arrested the leader of a vigilante group devoted to protecting cows, who had been accused of inciting deadly religious riots near New Delhi in July.\n\nMonu Manesar, whose official name is Mohit Yadav, leads a chapter of the radical Hindu right-wing group Bajrang Dal and is a suspect in the February mob lynching of two Muslim men accused of cow smuggling.\n\nCows are considered sacred by Hindus and their slaughter is illegal in many Indian states.\n\nManesar remained free and continued to post inflammatory, anti-Muslim content regularly on Facebook and Instagram for months after the authorities linked him to the murders.\n\nIn July, he announced plans to attend a Hindu procession in Nuh, a largely Muslim district near the capital. At least six people were killed and dozens more injured in the resulting unrest, which continued for days and spilt over to Delhi’s outskirts.\n\nPolice officers said that at least six members of a special investigation team of the Haryana police on Tuesday ambushed Manesar after he had gone to a nearby market and caught him around noon.\n\nBy 3.30pm, Manesar was produced in court and was ordered to be put in 14 days of judicial custody.\n\nNuh district police officer Shubhjeet Singh confirmed Manesar’s arrest on charges of spreading hateful content on social media.\n\n“Prior to the Aug 26 online post that threatened a Nuh rally with an attack, we did not have a formal case on which we could make an arrest,” a Haryana police officer told the Hindustan Times.\n\nPolice officers said they made the arrest only after ascertaining the threatening post was indeed made by Manesar.\n\n“Facebook provided us with the mobile phone number linked to the account. Investigations showed that the SIM card of the number was issued to a person named Mohit in Manesar and we went to get his address,” said an officer.\n\nManesar was later handed over to the police in Rajasthan, where charges have been registered against him over the February double murder.\n\nManesar has repeatedly denied the charges in the Bhiwani double-murder case and Nuh violence. After his name cropped up at the centre of communal clashes that broke out during a procession in Nuh, Manesar claimed that he was not there and certainly did not give any “hate speech” that could have led to the violent communal clashes.\n\nThe Vishva Hindu Parishad on Tuesday described Manesar as an “innocent cow-devotee” and alleged that the Congress government in Rajasthan got him arrested ahead of assembly polls in the state with an eye on Muslim votes.\n\nVHP working president Alok Kumar said the arrest by the Rajasthan Police will cost the ruling Congress “heavily” in the state. VHP will provide help to Manesar and “if necessary, will also protest” against his arrest, he added.\n\nManesar ultimately did not attend the July procession in Nuh, which saw cars set alight and stones hurled at participants.\n\nThe violence soon spread to nearby Gurugram, a key business centre and satellite city of Delhi where Nokia, Samsung and other multinationals have their Indian headquarters.\n\nIn one neighbourhood, a mob of around 200 people armed with sticks and stones looted several Muslim-owned meat shops and set fire to a restaurant while chanting Hindu religious slogans.\n\nManesar regularly posted videos celebrating attacks on Muslims accused of transporting or killing cows.\n\nAFP", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/31979d360995c3093811806633ce36ccb0c978378d0fe2e9bb098e7e361c006c?w=825", "alt_text": "Cow vigilante Monu Manesar (squatting) after his arrest in Haryana."}]}

Pathaan was released in January and Jawan last week. The highly-anticpated Dunki will be released in December.\n\nThe two hits underscore how critical Shah Rukh is to Bollywood, which was in a slump.\n\nHe told the media: “I’ve never done an action film, only sweet love stories, some social dramas, some bad guy roles, but nobody was taking me for action. I’m 57 years old and I thought of doing action films in the coming years. I want to do Mission Impossible kind of films. I want to do over-the-top action films.”\n\nThe stage seemed to be set for Shah Rukh when narcotics agents in 2021 arrested his son Aryan off the coast of Mumbai and jailed him for nearly a month even though no drugs were found on him.\n\nMany perceived this as an act of intimidation, a move meant to keep India’s top star in line.\n\nThe actor has been silent on the issue, preferring not to comment on political matters, but his 2023 filmography tells a different story.\n\nIn Pathaan, he played a Muslim fighting proudly for India, starring opposite Deepika Padukone and John Abraham, a Hindu and a Christian.\n\nJawan doesn’t touch religion but it solidifies Shah Rukh’s might in the face of a ruthless regime.\n\n“Before you lay a hand on my son, talk to his father,” he growled in the trailer, as the name of his producer wife Gauri appears onscreen.\n\n“Otherwise, prepare for the wrath of the King.”\n\nIn Jawan, Shah Rukh teams up with Tamil writer and director Atlee in a story about family, activism and revenge. It is violent, insane and an absolute roller-coaster ride with its love stories, high-speed chases and a hostage situation unfolding on an underground train.\n\nIt has South Indian megastars Vijay Sethupathi and Nayanthara, expertly weaving India’s most powerful film industries together in a thrilling moviegoing experience.\n\nWhile Pathan has become India’s highest-grossing Hindi film and the first Bollywood film to earn more than US$100 million ($136 million) without a release in China, Jawan has shattered box office records after Day 4 in the theatres.\n\nWith total earnings of Rs252.08 crore ($41 million) on Monday, Jawan is “beyond historic”, according to trade analyst Taran Adarsh. It has set a new benchmark for highest single-day earnings as well as highest extended weekend (four days).\n\nSunday’s total earnings were Rs71.63 crore, taking Jawan past the 250 crore mark. It is now the fastest Hindi film to have breached the Rs250 crore barrier, crossing the line on Day 4 and breaking the Rs250 crore record set by Pathaan.\n\nShah Rukh, who before this year starred in a number of lacklustre releases, said he was “overwhelmed” by the reception to the film.\n\nBorn in 1965, he grew up in a middle-class Muslim household in New Delhi. He was 14 when his dad, a businessman who fought against British rule and came from what is now northern Pakistan, died, leaving his magistrate mother to single-handedly raise Shah Rukh and his elder sister.\n\nAfter starring in television commercials in the 1980s, Shah Rukh achieved stardom as a boyish and sensitive heartthrob in a string of 1990s romantic hits, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998).\n\nSince then, he has featured in almost 100 films and is now a major businessman, owning a production house and an Indian Premier League cricket team.\n\nWhile other actors his age have been sidelined or relegated to supporting roles, Shah Rukh continues to be cast as one of Bollywood’s enduring leading men.\n\nMany have labelled 2023 as his comeback year, but the superstar himself does not see it that way. Quoting a line from the 1997 Hollywood film Gattaca, Shah Rukh posted on X: “I never saved anything for the swim back.”\n\nEven as fans fawn over Jawan and eagerly await Dunki, the quote is a reminder that Shah Rukh continues to move forward and redefine what it means to be a superstar, not just in Bollywood but also beyond it.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“I’m 57 years old and I thought of doing action films in the coming years.

Hindustan (“land of the Hindus” in Urdu) is another word for the country. The three names are used interchangeably officially and by the public.\n\nHowever, around the world, India is the most commonly used name.\n\nOver the years, though, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has been changing colonial names to “help India move past a mentality of slavery”.\n\nSupporters of the name change in the invitation said British colonial rulers had coined the name India to overshadow Bharat and forge a British legacy.\n\n“Our country’s name is Bharat and there should be no doubt about it,” said Mr Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a federal deputy minister.\n\nHindu groups linked to the BJP said the G20 summit provided the best opportunity to shed India’s colonial baggage.\n\nOn Tuesday, a senior BJP spokesman posted on X that Mr Modi was attending a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Indonesia as the “prime minister of Bharat”.\n\nOpposition leaders were, however, critical of the change, with some saying it aimed to eclipse their two-month-old political alliance, which is also called INDIA.\n\n“We all say ‘Bharat’, what is new in this?

He failed miserably.\n\n“I got my friends to taste the beer. They hated it,” said the 32-year-old entrepreneur who has now established himself in both Singapore and Japan as a beer manufacturer of repute.\n\nLess & Co, founded in 2019, is a sustainable-solutions provider that turns food waste into beverages.\n\nIts arm Crust turns surplus bread from local bakeries and grocers into beer, using ingredients such as coffee grounds, apple peels, cacao husks and tea leaves as flavouring.\n\nThe company’s new arm Crop turns vegetable scraps and fruit peels into sweet drinks – an idea mooted by the grocers.\n\nLess & Co claims to have saved over 3,000kg of food waste and reduced over 4,200kg of CO2 emissions through its sustainable model.\n\nMr Travinder, who proudly revealed that the company is working towards reducing 1 per cent of global food waste by 2030, said the practice of reducing wastage was instilled in him from a young age. He recalled his mother incorporating leftovers into other meals for their family of six.\n\n“Sustainability is not just an urban trend. It is a lifestyle choice,” he said.\n\nHe did not let his initial failure stop him from developing his business idea.\n\nMr Travinder visited 11 beer breweries and factories in California in 2019, spending almost two months volunteering his services for free at these places and learning from the staff.\n\nAfter formulating his own bread-to-beer process, he started Crust but struggled with gaining the trust of bars and restaurants to move away from their tried-and-tested alcohol products.\n\n“There was the misconception that we use expired products or food waste that had been partially consumed.

KARTHIKEYAN\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nHe has done the 100m in 10.39sec four times in recent months. Shave off 0.03sec, and he would become the youngest sprinter to set a new national mark in the event.\n\nLast Saturday, 21-year-old Singaporean Marc Brian Louis went close.\n\nThe full-time athlete produced a spectacular run to win gold at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. He again timed 10.39sec at the Nagase Cup, on a day when two other Singapore athletes went under 11sec.\n\nMarc and his teammates are in Japan to train with the Waseda University track team in preparation for the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, from Sept 23 to Oct 8.\n\nIf the sprinter – whose father Gilbert Louis is Tamil – cracks it in Hangzhou, he would better C. Kunalan, who was two weeks shy of 26 when he clocked 10.38sec at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico – a time that stood as the national record for 33 years.\n\nMarc would also go past U.K. Shyam, the man who holds the current mark of 10.37sec – set in 2001 – a few weeks after turning 25.\n\n“I hope I can get the national record soon,” Marc told\n\ntabla!\n\n.\n\n“I’m working towards that. It is just 0.02sec away, it can happen any time.”\n\nHis coach Benber Yu, a 42-year-old Filipino and former Philippine university-level 800m champion, is also positive.\n\n“Marc is doing very well in training, he has improved tremendously in recent years, but we are not rushing,” said Yu.\n\n“Whether he breaks the 100m mark at the Asian Games or not, it is okay either way. Marc still has plenty of time on his hands.”\n\nMarc was a hurdler making only a temporary switch to sprinting. In fact, his pet event is still the hurdles, which he has been specialising in since he joined his cousin – “just for fun” – in athletics as a co-curricular activity at Sembawang Primary School.\n\n“To do well in the 100m, you need speed and Marc has plenty of that,” said Yu.\n\n“Marc trains consistently, has the right attitude and is a hard-working boy. It’s his hard work that is taking him far.”\n\nMarc’s talent was apparent early on. He won silver at the National School Games (NSG) for three straight years.\n\nThat earned him a spot at the Singapore Sports School. But he left the school a year later.\n\nYu, who has been training Marc since the sprinter was only eight years old, saw his potential and persuaded the boy to return to the track and train harder.\n\nIn turning around from a low point, Marc was also encouraged by his father Gilbert, a 54-year-old lifeguard; Filipino mother Gielie, a 53-year-old nurse; and brother Frank, a 25-year-old IT specialist.\n\nThe support from his family and coach, and the many hours of training resulted in Marc claiming back-to-back B Division NSG titles when he was in Anderson Secondary School.\n\nIn 2019, he won the 400m hurdles final at the Asian Youth Championships in Hong Kong, becoming Singapore’s first and only gold medallist at the meet.\n\nCoach Yu said that was a pivotal moment\n\nfor Marc’s charge\n\n. “He became more mature, everything changed. How he trains, rests and takes care of himself, what he eats, he has really been giving his best since.”\n\nIn Hong Kong, Marc also clocked 13.74sec in the 110m hurdles to set a new national U-18 record.\n\nIn 2021, while competing at the World Athletics U-20 Championships in Nairobi, he set a new national U-20 record for the 110m hurdles at 13.77sec despite finishing 11th.\n\nIn the same year, he broke the national U-20 record for the 100m with 10.39sec.\n\nBut Marc is focusing on the 100m sprint, making quick progress as he won bronze at the Hanoi SEA Games in 2022 and silver at the Phnom Penh SEA Games in May this year.\n\nMarc also timed 10.39sec in the semi-final of the Asian Championships in Bangkok in July.\n\n“I hope to win the gold at the 2025 SEA Games,” said Marc.\n\n“I have two more years and I’m working hard towards it. I’m trying to balance National Service duties and track life, training as much as possible for whatever competition I’m going for.”\n\nMarc trains at least six times a week with his Cicada athletics team.\n\n“He is doing extra training for the Asian Games. The good thing is his Cicada teammates are pushing him hard,” said Yu.\n\n“Marc has a good start and his acceleration is excellent. His weakness is speed endurance. He often finishes well off the pace in races. We are working to improve his finish.”\n\nMarc currently ranks among the top 10 Asian sprinters, with Japan’s Abdul Hakim Sani Brown on top with 9.97sec, followed by compatriots Hiroki Yanagita (10.02sec) and Yoshihide Kiryu (10.03sec).\n\n“My first aim is to make it to the final, then we will take it from there,” said Marc.\n\n“If the weather conditions are good, I might really do well.\n\n“I always visualise myself winning a race. I am confident I will clock my personal best in Hangzhou.”\n\n“I hope I can get the national record soon. I’m working towards that. It is just 0.02sec away, it can happen any time.”\n\nMarc Brian Louis", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/725165db9834fe93709adf0569fd5c677ac343b54d6933868362d15c90e404e2?w=825", "alt_text": ""}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam’s thumping victory last Friday, by the largest margin in a Singapore presidential election, shows that the country’s electorate is mature, thoughtful and judicious, say voters.\n\nFollowing a campaign in which the independence of the presidential candidates drew attention and race became a subliminal issue, voters set aside political ideologies and social media persuasions to elect the 66-year-old based on his merits.\n\nMr Tharman secured 70.4 per cent of the ballot, former GIC investment chief Ng Kok Song 15.72 per cent and former NTUC Income chief executive Tan Kin Lian 13.88 per cent.\n\n“Mr Tharman’s popularity in Taman Jurong has now translated across the nation,” said community leader N.

A Renaissance man, he can connect with people of all races and social groups.”\n\nSree Narayana Mission (Singapore) CEO S. Devendran said: “Mr Tharman’s victory is testament to the Singapore electorate’s political maturity.\n\nSingapore has elected a Singaporean Indian, not an Indian Singaporean\n\n“This president will bring to the office one of the sharpest and keenest financial and economic minds. Critically, he will also bring empathy and respect for all Singaporeans.\n\n“He has the ability to work with the government and give advice to help build a better and more compassionate and respectful Singapore.”\n\nTo theatre personality Daisy Irani, the significance of Mr Tharman’s win is colossal.\n\n“I felt much trepidation over how much importance the electorate would put on race in making a vote,” she said.\n\n“My heart surged with pride and respect for my countrymen when they picked the best man for the job despite all the subliminal suggestions on social media that they would be better served by a member of the majority.\n\n“It is testament to Singaporean wisdom that when it comes down to brass tacks, we can be truly colour-blind.”\n\nMr Ramky Subramanian, CEO of Fincrest Advisors (Singapore) and ex-chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (Singapore chapter), pointed out that “Mr Tharman’s win indicates that Singapore is truly an open society that honours merit, track record and capabilities over race, ethnic background and religion”.\n\n“It’s a great positive for the country,” he said.\n\nVoters believe Mr Tharman will be dynamic and create an impact.\n\n“His domain knowledge, expertise and experience, especially in the management of reserves, will be a great advantage,” said Ms Purnima Kamath, founder and CEO of event management company De Ideaz.\n\n“Mr Tharman’s presence on the international stage is already world-class. He has always stood by ‘respect for all’, which has resonated regardless of race, language and religion.”\n\nVoters believe Mr Tharman will bring to bear his extensive experience as Senior Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, as well as his leadership position with major international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Economic Forum and United Nations Development Forum.\n\n“He brings to the table vast knowledge, impeccable credentials and extensive experience as a leader who can tackle complex issues and policies and represent Singapore on the global stage,” said technopreneur Anton Ravindran.\n\n“Plus he has the ability to unify people from diverse backgrounds, beyond race, religion and language.”\n\nMs Ranjani Rangan, chairman of the International Trade Council, South East Asia, said that “given Mr Tharman’s excellent people skills and how he is widely respected, he will be a steady pair of hands for the future for Singaporeans”.\n\nMr Chandran Nantha Kumar, chief sustainability officer and vice-president of operations at Interplex Precision Technology Singapore, is confident Mr Tharman will incorporate sustainability in his engagements.\n\n“He believes it’s not only about the quantity and quality of each initiative, but also the viable culture of growth that is cultivated among Singapore residents, a culture of sustainability that can grow exponentially even amid uncertainties,” said Mr Kumar.\n\nMr Tharman has always been a supporter of progress within the Indian community. In his past roles as chairman of Sinda and Senior Minister, he made valuable contributions to many important development initiatives benefiting Indians in Singapore.\n\n“He can do even more to bring the Indian community together,” said Singapore Indian Association president Tamil Marren.\n\n“We hope he can further unify the nation through community integration initiatives that involve native Indians, grassroots leaders, academics and new immigrants.\n\n“Just like past presidents Devan Nair and S.R. Nathan, Mr Tharman too can become an inspirational leader.”\n\nMr George Koshy, commercial manager at Newport Duty Free, feels “Mr Tharman has the well-rounded attributes of experience, expertise, humility and affability to help Singapore navigate a complex global environment”.\n\n“He will unite all Singaporeans,” said the 58-year-old.\n\nDr Sandhya Singh, convenor of Hindi and Tamil languages at NUS, said: “Mr Tharman has been exceptional in all the roles he has played.\n\n“He has a wealth of professional experience and his character is commendable. He will excel given his skills and charisma.”\n\nMr Tharman, whose wife Jane Ittogi is a Singaporean of Japanese-Chinese heritage, is the first non-Chinese presidential candidate to win an open, contested and direct election.\n\nCommunity leader Varaprasad is confident Mr Tharman will navigate the system with diplomacy.\n\n“He can provide guidance from behind the scenes and share his knowledge and experience to younger leaders. He will also lead the way to a fairer society, giving the people the respect and dignity they deserve.”\n\n“People see in him a true Singaporean, a man of the people, and one who can move in the highest of circles.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFemale stars are often the biggest draw in Bollywood – an industry still dominated by men.\n\nTired of being sidelined, the women are banding together to voice their woes.\n\n“We would have at least 80-90 people on a set but only three or four of them women,” said film producer Petrina D’Rozario, founder and president of Women In Film And Television, India, a non-profit advocacy group based in Mumbai – the heart of the country’s film industry.\n\n“We would also bump into each other and say, ‘Oh, my God. Why can’t we get a toilet?’”\n\nBesides the dearth of toilets, the women also face the lack of childcare facilities, lower pay and late-night shifts that disregard their personal safety.\n\nThese are among the issues that have driven D’Rozario and other women working in India’s huge film industry to form their own groups outside the traditional trade union framework to lobby on issues related to working conditions and gender-related inequalities.\n\n“In my mind, most of the film fraternity is a boys’ club,” said Fowzia Fathima, cinematographer and founding member of the Indian Women Cinematographers’ Collective.\n\nWhile the groups lack the bargaining power of a traditional union, they provide a forum for women to find work, seek advice on workplace harassment and share professional tips and industry news.\n\n“It’s a safe space to discuss our concerns, which is needed until things can be discussed in the open,” said Fathima.\n\nIn India’s\n\nRs2.1 trillion ($340 billion)\n\nhuge movie business, men outnumber women in Bollywood film crews by five to two, according to research by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences.\n\nIn Hollywood, the ratio is similar, with about a third of key behind-the-scenes crew jobs occupied by women.\n\nIndia’s film industry is the world’s most prolific, churning out about 2,000 films each year and employing all kinds of artists. But women in Bollywood struggle to get hired, said University of Wisconsin-Madison academic Darshana Sreedhar Mini who studies labour organisation in the Indian film industry.\n\nPart of the imbalance is due to women’s unequal representation in unions and the lack of women in leadership roles.\n\nWomen hold only about 10 per cent of senior management roles on set, according to a 2022 industry report by media consulting group Ormax Media and streaming platform Amazon Prime Video.\n\n“Many organisations have one or two women and the overall picture remains very bleak,” said Ms Sreedhar, adding that the biggest concern is the industry’s pay gap. And female crew members continue to face other challenges, such as difficulty in getting hired and being made to feel unwelcome on set, especially in technical roles.\n\nD’Rozario said her group has worked with others in helping women get scholarships, internships and networking opportunities.\n\n“We went through so much fire in trying to raise funds to make things happen,” she added, saying that the payoff has been worth the effort, seeing female filmmakers blossom in the industry.\n\n“There is an iceberg of issues, we are touching just the tip.”\n\nThomson Reuters Foundation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1a5c934ae7803844098d008ed0b247742d5e1fa4f078c8533ba7c3c1c905b4c6?w=825", "alt_text": "Cinematographer Fowzia Fathima."}]}

He said the fruit is a “propitious and welcome” symbol for many people here.\n\nThen, in an interview with Kiss 92, Mr Tharman revealed that when he was campaigning at Lau Pa Sat hawker centre at Raffles Quay, some government officers shared with him a pineapple from Assam. They had brought a few back to interest importers here.\n\nMr Tharman said the Assam pineapple looked and tasted different – it had soft, luscious leaves on top and the fruit was much sweeter than other varieties of pineapple.\n\nMr Tharman had also considered the durian – regarded as the “king of fruits” – as his campaign logo, with his team comprising “quite a large group of people of different age groups”.\n\n“What was interesting is that we agreed on the pineapple in less than 10 seconds... It was something we liked. It was something we felt was easy to understand.”\n\nFrom the loud cheers of “ong lai” (Hokkien for pineapple and sounds similar to the phrase “good fortune comes”) from supporters and his resounding 70.4 per cent victory, Mr Tharman undoubtedly made the right choice.\n\nThere were complications. For example, a woman had to go home and change when she arrived at a polling station in a pineapple-print top.\n\nAlso, in a dialogue posted on social media, Mr Tharman\n\nshared\n\nspoke of how he and his wife Jane Ittogi “whacked” copious amounts of orh nee – a Teochew dessert of sweetened yam paste – when they decided to start a family.\n\nThey had learnt of the Yoruba tribe in Africa, which ate loads of yam and had a high number of twins.\n\n“So Jane being Teochew, we decided to really whack on orh nee,” said Mr Tharman.\n\nSomething must have worked as the couple have a daughter and three sons, although Mr Tharman did state that he can’t claim if there was any scientific basis\n\nbehind\n\nto it.\n\nWhen asked by the Kiss 92 hosts if he had something to share with the listeners, Mr Tharman quoted the Indian poet, writer, artist and social reformer Rabindranath Tagore, whom he described as “one of the great people who lived in the last century”.\n\nTagore had said: “I slept and dreamt that life was a joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.”\n\nMr Tharman added that this saying stuck with him because it rang true.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b329a36d41595a2af510cbc2d7f1653cda530c35126845b2834a3e27c5598186?w=825", "alt_text": "President-elect Tharman Shanmugaratnam and wife Jane Ittogi as guests on Kiss92FM’s The Big Show."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFormer Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam last week became Singapore’s first non-Chinese presidential candidate to win a contested election.\n\nHe contested against two Chinese candidates but they together garnered only 29.6 per cent of the vote against his 70.4 per cent in a country where the Chinese comprise an overwhelming 74.3 per cent of the population.\n\nThe landslide victory represents a solid vote of confidence in a person of exemplary talent. Mr Tharman is a deeply moral and intellectual individual whose natural intelligence is matched by an equal degree of compassion for the disadvantaged and respect for those with alternative social views.\n\nClearly he was voted for as a person, not because of his ethnicity. Mr Tharman is from the Indian community, which accounts for 9 per cent of Singaporeans.\n\nHis activism during his student years, tempered by the realities of participating in the governance of a nation in an imperfect world, has produced that rare human being: a realist-idealist.\n\nMr Tharman led the People’s Action Party (PAP) team to a thumping victory that retained Jurong Group Representation Constituency (GRC) with 74.62 per cent of the vote in the 2020 General Election. In the previous hustings of 2015, he had led his team in Jurong GRC to win the highest vote share for the PAP, with 79.3 per cent.\n\nJurong GRC, a multiracial constituency like others, has turned out to be a microcosm of Singapore’s national politics.\n\nWhat this says about Singapore is that the electorate is a mature and discerning one that is willing to look beyond race to talent in its choice of leaders.\n\nAdmittedly, race matters: That is why the GRC system exists in the first place – to ensure that ethnic minorities will always have a place in Parliament.\n\nEvery party, including PAP, is obliged to run a multiracial slate of candidates for the GRCs if it wishes to compete in them at all. Singapore is not post-racial, in which case there would be no need for GRCs.\n\nYet, Singapore is not race-bound either. The country stands at a transitional point where ethnicity is acknowledged as a reality but one which must not overshadow the larger project of nation-building, whose democratic basis is guaranteed ultimately by the legitimating process of general and presidential elections.\n\nFor Indian Singaporeans, Mr Tharman’s victory is not an ethnic one. He could not have won even if every Indian Singaporean citizen, to the exclusion of other ethnicities, had voted for him. He could not have won even if all Malay voters (whose community constitutes 13.5 per cent of the population) had rooted for him.\n\nThe Chinese vote made an overwhelming difference. His victory is a multiracial one.\n\nEvery Indian Singaporean would recognise that one of their own has won politically because other ethnic communities also considered him to be one of their own politically.\n\nThis is the magic of Singapore’s multiracialism. It accepts the reality of racial difference because, to not do so would lead to the cultural assimilation of minority Indians, Malays and Eurasians into a Chinese national sphere.\n\nThat would be a horrible price to be paid by the minorities for being Singaporean.\n\nIntegration allows various cultures and traditions to flourish within an expansive national framework. No one is subordinated to anyone else. Everybody is an extended function of everyone else.\n\nThe Indian diaspora, by which I mean not only Indians who have become citizens of their host countries but also Indians who retain their Indian citizenship while living abroad, have been buoyed rightly by the rise of fellow-Indians to high political office.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and American Vice-President Kamala Harris are three among many illustrious persons of Indian origin who stand out.\n\nHowever, in every case, they have done so by subsuming their ethnicity to their nationality. Only in that way have they drawn the trust of those who are ethnically different.\n\nMr Tharman’s victory is that of Singapore’s multiracialism. His Indianness is a part of that system and structure. May these verities never change.\n\nAsad Latif is an editorial writer for The Straits Times\n\nHis activism during his student years, tempered by the realities of participating in the governance of a nation in an imperfect world, has produced that rare human being: a realist-idealist.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/533708338cc9fd7bd2f58994d5d3881a872d6a5bd881dedd1594c3dcf76d2880?w=825", "alt_text": "President-elect Tharman Shanmugaratnam meeting supporters on Sept 2."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhile most Bollywood actors prefer to do remakes of Southern films, Shah Rukh Khan chose a top Tamil director to work with under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment.\n\nJawan, released worldwide on Thursday, also features Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi, who are big names in Tamil and South Indian films.\n\nSacnilk.com and film trade analyst Manobala Vijayabalan reported that Jawan sold more than 700,000 tickets in India on the opening day – a record for Hindi movies.\n\nVijayabalan posted on X: “Jawan Day 1 advance sales crosses Rs20 crore ($3 million) gross mark across all theatres in India. National Multiplexes alone sell more than 300,000 tickets.”\n\nJawan was released in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada.\n\nRuban Mathivanan of Chennai’s GK Cinemas said Jawan is seen as a Tamil film in Tamil Nadu. “If the content clicks, there will be no stopping Jawan in Tamil Nadu. It might become another RRR or KGF.”\n\nHe added that “Jawan can also emerge as the biggest Hindi film” and it will not face competition from local Tamil releases this week. “Some small films are releasing on Sept 8. They won’t pose a competition to Jawan.”\n\nVishek Chauhan, owner of Bihar’s Roopbani Cinema, observed that Jawan is a Tamil film with a Northern superstar. “The director and significant actors are from down South,” he said. “I won’t be surprised if it does Rs10 crores on Day 1 in Tamil.”\n\nShah Rukh is scoring a hit with Jawan, which also stars Sanya Malhotra, Sunil Grover, Ridhi Dogra and Yogi Babu in key roles. After making a comeback with Pathaan earlier this year, Jawan is his most South film as he taps a market other than Bollywood.\n\nShah Rukh has a fanbase in the South thanks to his efforts in Mani Ratnam’s Dil Se and A.R. Rahman’s foot-tapping Chaiyya Chaiyya (Thaiyya Thaiyya in Tamil). In 2000, he was also cast in Kamal Haasan’s iconic Hey Ram, in which he played Amjad Ali Khan.\n\nShah Rukh did a dance number for Rajinikanth’s Ra One in 2011 and Lungi Dance in Chennai Express in 2013. Both became hits despite criticisms for stereotyping Tamils.\n\nOthers from the Tamil film industry, such as composer Anirudh Ravichander, editor Ruben, cinematographer GK Vishnu, choreographer Shobi and art director Muthuraj, are setting foot in Bollywood for the first time with Jawan.\n\nJawan is an action thriller with Shah Rukh playing two roles – one hijacks the Mumbai Metro with a squad of six women while the other is a police officer hot on the heels of notorious arms dealer Kalee, played by Sethupathi.\n\n“Of justice and a jawan. Of women and their vengeance. Of a mother and a son. And of course, a lot of fun,” Shah Rukh had said about the film on social media.\n\nThere’s a cameo by Deepika Padukone, who starred opposite Shah Rukh in Pathaan, and Nayanthara plays a police officer tasked with nabbing Shah Rukh and his gang.\n\nSinger Aaliyah Qureishi, who is making her Bollywood debut with Jawan, told The National that fans can look forward to “Director Atlee Kumar’s visionary flair with all of Shah Rukh Khan’s charisma and style”.\n\n“You can look forward to a really fun and exciting film, which also has a great message at its heart. You can also look forward to seeing us girls beat up some very big guys,” she said.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“If the content clicks, there will be no stopping Jawan in Tamil Nadu.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe annual appearance of Durga Puja, which fell from Oct 20 to 24 this year, has provided a source of festive continuity with my life in Kolkata since I arrived in Singapore almost four decades ago.\n\nI was in my late 20s and eager to find a place in a new country without giving up the sense of myself that had evolved naturally in a great Bengali city defined by the worship of two iconic mother-goddesses, Kali and Durga.\n\nThe pujas devoted to them every year renewed the idea of Bengalis as a people, no matter where they lived: in West Bengal, or elsewhere in India, or Bangladesh, or elsewhere in the world.\n\nDurga Puja, in particular, was an eclectic cultural phenomenon that drew admiring crowds that toured Kolkata over five days to observe the magnificently erected pandals, or pavilions, in which Mother Durga and her four children – Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesh and Kartik – are worshipped. The pandals vied with one another in inventive agency as they drew their architectural motifs from the ebb and flow of Bengali life.\n\nThe scale and grandeur of the pavilions, the imaginative lighting that made them beacons for the homing soul after dark, the crowds that navigated their mortal passage through the precincts as they glimpsed the divine – all these made Durga Puja not only an event but a phenomenon. Sound matched sight when dhakis, or drummers, beat all hearts into a common rhythmic frenzy during arati, the ritual dance worship.\n\nAnjali, the offering of flowers enfolded in prayerful palms, signified the release of possession into faith. Women played a leading role in bringing Durga – a woman, after all – into the lives of men.\n\nBijoya Dashami, the last day of the puja when the deities are immersed in the river, was a moment of great sadness. Durga left as predictably as she had come, and it would take another year to be able to fete her.\n\nHowever, since years always arrive, her presence became a part of the cyclical reassurance of time: She would return. Human life was different: It was linear.\n\nTrue, children would be born, they would grow up, they would have children of their own, they would gather to welcome the goddess, and Durga Puja would continue.\n\nHowever, the ageing who were at the head of the linear queue wondered: How much longer would they live to celebrate the divine cyclicality of the puja? Would this puja be their last? What then?\n\nSo it is in Singapore. I am in my late 60s. I have begun to think of Durga Puja without me. It is bound to occur one day. O dear! Poor me.\n\nThis is not an idle worry. The Ramakrishna Mission at Bartley Road, a sanctuary in which I have recovered my Bengali/Indian past during Durga Puja, is a good index of the mortal condition. The prayer room on the first floor was crowded as usual during the Saptami (seventh-day) devotions on the morning of Oct 21.\n\nAs usual, I was late. As usual, someone made space for me on one of the chairs on the left side of the room, where the men sat. I nodded in gratitude. Then I looked around. There were many young faces that I had not seen before. I am blessed.\n\nThere were children who had grown up, but I could recognise them through their thin moustaches and studious glasses. My blessings do not end. There were familiar faces with receding chins and expanding waistlines (like mine). Welcome to the blessings of seniority, tired comrades. But some faces were absent. Were they too busy to have come? Were they travelling? Were they sick? Were they...?\n\nAnd so it will be with me one day. Someone may wonder what has happened to me.\n\nMeanwhile, the next Durga Puja awaits, whether at the Ramakrishna Mission or at the many other venues where Ma Durga is venerated in Singapore. As in Kolkata, as in Dhaka, as in Delhi, as in Sydney, as in London, as in New York, as in anywhere where Bengalis breathe, Durga will be a part of cyclical time.\n\nLinear lives need only to acknowledge their mortality – and look upwards.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2dab3ee5c93f387104c54e7ab90f2129a47dd4763d2670188aac77c3915cc641?w=825", "alt_text": "Bengali women apply Sindur, or red dye, on their faces as a ritual before the immersion of the statue of Goddess Durga into the river Ganges on the last day of the Durga Puja festival in Kolkata on Oct 24."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSenior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday slammed the circulation of photos showing him with Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, saying it was “an act of cheap politics”, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\nThe Thiruvananthapuram MP said the photos were taken during Ms Moitra’s birthday party, which was attended by some 15 people, including his sister, and that the images had been cropped before they were uploaded online.\n\n“This is just cheap politics. It was the birthday party of a child. Well, she is not a child, but to me, she is like one. That MP is around 20 years younger to me,” PTI cited Mr Tharoor as saying.\n\n“It was her birthday party, in which around 15 people, including my sister, were part of. Instead of showing the full image, they are spreading the cropped one.”\n\nMr Tharoor added that he does not give importance to “such trolls” and is busy working for the people.\n\nLast week, Ms Moitra had also reacted to the photos, saying she was amused at seeing her photos circulating on social media. She accused the “BJP’s troll sena” of being behind it.\n\n“Most amused to see some personal photos of me being circulated on social media by BJP’s troll sena,” she wrote on X on Oct 15. “I like the green dress better than the white blouse.\n\n“And why bother cropping? Show the rest of the folks at dinner as well. Bengal’s women live a life, not a lie.”\n\nAfter one of the photos showed her holding a cigar, Ms Moitra clarified that she does not smoke and is allergic to smoking.\n\n“I don’t smoke. I am severely allergic to cigarettes. I was just posing with a friend’s cigar for a laugh,” she posted in reply to a comment by a netizen.\n\nThe controversy comes amid the alleged cash-for-query row, in which Ms Moitra has been accused by a Supreme Court advocate and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker of taking a “bribe” from businessman Darshan Hiranandani to raise questions against the Adani Group in Parliament.\n\nBJP MP Nishikant Dubey, who complained against her before the Lok Sabha Speaker, has sought her suspension from the House till the probe is completed.\n\nMs Moitra has denied the allegations, calling it a bid to silence her in Parliament.\n\nThe Trinamool MP said she was ready to face a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2f268a0d4c9618abbb8774cc2fe728b9afda23cfcac1817689cbb17bcc15b9a8?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian MPs Shashi Tharoor and Mahua Moitra."}]}

And that came after the closure of an outlet of the restaurant in Race Course Road in 2019.\n\nMr Rajkumar opened Fennel by Komala Vilas, whose target market is the younger crowd, in River Valley Road in December 2020. The restaurant offers vegetarian fare with interesting dishes such as plant-based Rasam Chicken Mini Burger, Truffle-Cheese Dosa and Pandan Adhirasam. Diners can also enjoy craft beers at Fennel.\n\n“Like many other restaurants, we had a severe shortage of manpower during the pandemic. Some of our employees were stuck in India and couldn’t come back,” Mr Rajakumar told\n\ntabla!\n\n, adding that the time is right for a new outlet now that things have returned to normal.\n\n“We hope the new outlet can help ease the long queues outside our main restaurant at Serangoon Road.”\n\nThe new single-storey Komala Vilas outlet can seat up to 60 people.\n\nKomala Vilas has become a household name in Singapore since it was established by Mr Rajakumar’s grandfather O.M.

Santosh Kumar\n\nHis job in the Singapore Army was stable. But Major Lau Wei Yong decided to quit in June.\n\nIt was not a decision taken in a flash. The 40-year-old, who was a Guards officer, had decided some time ago that he would become a hawker.\n\n“I can retire at 50,” he told\n\ntabla!\n\n“But I chose not to. I served the army for 18 years, and I felt it was enough. I just wanted to start my own little business.”\n\nThe hawker business was not new to him – he helped his parents at their Amoy Street Food Centre fruit juice stall from the age of 10.\n\nBut what surprised his friends and well-wishers was that he decided to set up an Indian briyani stall, Spicelios, a few rows from his parents’ set-up, which is now run by his wife Low Siew Hui, 40. Mr Lau’s parents have retired.\n\n“To get into the F&B business, you have to get your fundamentals right,” said Mr Lau, who was not much of a cook before starting Spicelios. “And I thought the hawker venture is ideal because the capital is not high.\n\n“Why I started an Indian food stall is because a Chinese selling chicken rice is very common. There is huge competition in that area. So, I wanted to do something unique.”\n\nMr Lau researched Indian cuisine online, especially the preparation of briyani.\n\n“An Indian army colleague’s family taught me how to prepare it,” he said. “Then I did more research and found my own style.”\n\nHe makes the curry and fried chicken ($6.50) and mutton ($8) versions of the briyani, and also serves naan, which is provided by a supplier. It goes well with the onion salad and pappadum that he makes.\n\nThen there are also the Giant Fusion Wraps ($6.90) – which are stuffed with lettuce, cabbage, onion, tomato, grilled chicken and other ingredients – and chicken wings ($4 for three).\n\n“I basically have only two main dishes because I am just starting out and have to do everything by myself, even though my wife and grandma help out,” said Mr Lau.\n\n“But my briyani is special because I cook the rice and gravy separately.”\n\n“In future, if I can employ people, I will expand my menu.”\n\nPeople of all ethnicities have been visiting Spicelios.\n\nAccounts executive Kalpana Kalki sang praises of the food: “I consider his briyani one of the best I have had. He should keep up the good work and continue adding dishes to his menu.”\n\nCivil servant Alex Goh, who was at the stall with his friends Cheer Ho and Fredrik Wong, said he loved the briyani “because the chicken is so tender”. He added: “The curry is also nice as it is not overly spicy, the portion is generous, and we get a lot of pappadums.”\n\nFor Mr Lau, it has been challenging to find the right spices and get the mix right.\n\n“It involves a lot of spices, and you simply cannot add them in,” he said. “You have to be precise to get the correct taste. I went online to research spices and got help from my friend’s family. I go to Mustafa Centre once a week to buy the spices.”\n\nSpicelios is open from 8am to 7pm on weekdays. Mr Lau and his wife spend their weekends with their children, aged 10, five and four.\n\n“In this business, you need to spend a lot of time preparing, cooking, washing and closing,” he said.  “I have a very supportive wife who helps to take care of the family and, when her time permits, peels potatoes and cuts the vegetables.\n\n“When I feel confident and can add more dishes, I will open for more days. I still have a lot of fine-tuning and adding to do, like mee goreng, prata and masala dosa.”\n\nMr Lau does not regret his career move despite a 90 per cent pay cut.\n\n“It’s important that I don’t stay in the comfort zone,” he said. “I am only 40 and I want to try out new things, so that I have no regrets in my old age. I try my best, even if it is sometimes very tough.”\n\nSpicelios is at Amoy Street Food Centre, 7 Maxwell Road, #01-69.\n\n“Why I started an Indian food stall is because a Chinese selling chicken rice is very common. There is huge competition in that area. So, I wanted to do something unique.”\n\nMr Lau Wei Yong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ce9132331c777cf4b1c56f420d04884dd802f7a8e2a0850ec1291e41afe92524?w=825", "alt_text": "Lau Wei Yong at his Indian hawker stall Spicelios."}]}

Senthilmurugan at his Thambi Magazine Store.\n\nTamil Murasu\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nA landmark in Holland Village for about 80 years, Thambi Magazine Store has been featured numerous times in the mass media.\n\nNow it has won an award from the global affairs and lifestyle publication Monocle, an honour highly prized by Mr P. Senthilmurugan, who operates the store with family members.\n\nHe said: “Being recognised as Asia’s top print media outlet is the highest honour we have received, and it is acknowledgement of our commitment to our customers.”\n\nMr Senthilmurugan is commonly known as Sam, a name his regular customers gave him.\n\nSam’s late grandfather P. Govindasamy was distributing newspapers in the area way back in the 1940s.\n\nSam’s father G. Periathambi then started the shop. It sold sweets, all sorts of knick-knacks and newspapers.\n\nBritish servicemen and their families living in the area asked for magazines from their homeland, and the business grew steadily.\n\nSam said that in the 1990s the store offered about 7,000 titles, ranging from British newspapers and Beano comics to international news magazines. Today, the selection comprises about 1,000 magazines.\n\nWhen his father was taken ill, Sam – as the eldest son – took over the business. For starters, he renamed it Thambi Magazine Store in honour of his father.\n\nAsked about the future of magazines in this digital era, Sam is optimistic and pointed out: “It’s a niche business and magazines have evolved from monthly issues on a variety of subjects to featuring one or two very topical cover stories.\n\n“Unlike social media with their brief outlines, these cover stories are well-researched and very informative.”\n\nSam also sees a lot of promise in the upcoming One Holland Village development which features residential and commercial components, as well as community spaces.\n\nHe said: “This will inject more vitality in this area and there will be many new residents. It will be good for Holland Village, and what is good for the village, is good for my business.”\n\nOne Holland Village Shops is expected to open by the end of this year, while One Holland Village Residences is targeted for completion by end-2024.\n\nFor the time being, Sam is trying to trim his overheads especially since a sub-tenant moved out in June this year. Luckily, Sam was able to rent the excess space to a little takeaway cafe soon after.\n\nHe said: “The cafe complements the magazine business and I also get to enjoy a cup of coffee now and then.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bfec9be5b442ae67265c29d92959acbfd46b9fa232dafff9037ddc0561b92ca8?w=825", "alt_text": "P.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAfter working in a bank for seven years, Ms Vathsala Muthu decided to leave her job in May this year without another one in hand.\n\nThe mother of two toddlers had for a while planned to switch careers to become a property agent. But until a year ago, she thought she would make the switch while remaining employed.\n\n“While being employed, I have to focus on family, career and my skills upgrade,” said the 31-year-old. “By taking a break, I am now enjoying the benefits of focusing on my sole interest.”\n\nAnticipating the strain this would put on her media professional husband, Ms Vathsala cut down her expenses and saved for a year. She already had a good bank balance, which helped her avoid anxiety and worry.\n\nThe break also came in handy, as the Singaporean was able to travel to India for her grandmother’s funeral.\n\nMs Vathsala is among several young people in Singapore who have dared to give up their steady jobs to pursue a different interest.\n\nThen there are those like Mr Selvam Ramanathan, who overcame his disappointment at being laid off by his IT company by climbing the 6,250-metre Kang Yatse II in Ladakh, India, early this month.\n\n“Mountains have always allowed me to challenge myself and push my boundaries, and this one was really tough,” said the 34-year-old. “I met some like-minded people on the trip and had wonderful conversations and built friendships.”\n\nThe Singaporean, who lost his job last month, has updated his LinkedIn profile and regularly submits job applications. He has also reached out to friends, asking about available jobs.\n\n“I am confident that I will eventually land a job that suits me,” he said. “Even though sometimes I feel lost, I keep reminding myself that this phase will pass soon.”\n\nA similar fate befell Mr P. Ravi in July 2021, when he was retrenched by his company. But the employment-pass holder found a job within eight months in the technology sector.\n\nHe said the break allowed him to reassess his priorities as he used to put in long hours at work.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who lived alone in a rented apartment with his family in India, began to exercise and run regularly and watched more television. These helped him to de-stress.\n\nHe also learnt online stock trading and managed to earn some money.\n\nAccording to Mr Vivek Iyyani, founder of Millennial Minds, a leadership training organisation with a focus on employee engagement, millennials are not afraid of being unemployed these days, because they have the option of earning via social media. “Compared with previous generations, young people want their jobs to be meaningful and good for their mental health,” he said.\n\njobs27 - P.

Santosh Kumar\n\nLokesh Kanagaraj’s Tamil-language film Leo: Bloody Sweet, starring Vijay, debuted in third position at the global box office last weekend by raking in US$31.2 million ($42.7 million), according to estimates released on Sunday by Comscore.\n\nThe weekend was won by Martin Scorsese’s Killers Of The Flower Moon, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone, with US$44 million, followed by Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour with US$41.5 million.\n\nBut in terms of the worldwide cumulative figure among new releases, Leo earned US$48.5 million (after four days), beating Killers Of The Flower Moon, making the Indian film the biggest international box-office hit last weekend.\n\nThis is a phenomenal performance by Leo despite the hurdles the film had to overcome in recent months, with some parties putting the blame on the politics in Tamil Nadu and the growing popularity of Vijay.\n\nThe ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government on Sept 28 denied permission for the film’s audio launch, which was scheduled to take place at the Nehru Stadium in Chennai on Sept 30, citing security concerns, reported The Times of India.\n\nThe Madras High Court turned down a plea from the producers to allow the screening of the film from 4am on the Oct 19 opening day and gave the nod for only 9am shows.\n\nWhen the film’s trailer was launched on Oct 5, there were viewers who claimed that Vijay insulted women in one of his dialogues. A report was filed with the Chennai City police commissioner to remove the scene.\n\nThe producers became anxious when theatre property got damaged during a special screening of the teaser.\n\nA court in Hyderabad imposed a stay on Leo’s screening till Oct 20, after Telugu film producer S. Nagavashi claimed that he had already registered the name Leo for his upcoming film.\n\nEarlier, the film was panned for glorifying smoking in the song Naa Ready and there were claims the dancers did not get paid.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the problems for Leo began after Vijay made politically-loaded statements at the film’s audio and teaser launch events. There were claims that the DMK government is wary of Vijay’s political ambitions, with the Indian general elections scheduled for next year.\n\nSome reports also said that Leo’s producers did not want to give the distribution rights of certain prime territories in Chennai and surrounding districts to Red Giant Movies, owned by Udhaynidhi Stalin, the Minister for Youth Welfare and Sports Development and son of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin.\n\nLeo is about cafe owner Vijay who is incited to return to his violent past.\n\nThe movie, which was made with a massive budget of Rs300 crore ($49 million), raked in Rs487 crore even before its release, through the sale of satellite, digital and video rights, according to trade analysts. Netflix acquired the OTT rights for an astounding Rs125 crore.\n\nVijay has not commented on the controversies or the success of Leo. Kanagaraj has said that Vijay is not to be blamed for the dialogue controversy.\n\n“The expression of anger and other emotions in a movie is shown not just through violent scenes but through the words as well,” said the director.\n\n“During shooting, Vijay asked me whether using that word would be appropriate or would it cause any trouble.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFormer Singapore cricket team captain Stacey Muruthi remembers the over he faced from Bishan Bedi at the Padang on Feb 10, 1978. He swept the first two balls from the legendary Indian spinner to the boundary.\n\n“But then he kept pitching it outside leg,” said Stacey, who is now 71. “And I was not sure whether I should play a shot or defend.\n\n“I blocked three balls. Then the sixth one, he pitched it again outside leg. I let it go. The ball spun viciously and hit my stumps. I was bowled around my legs.”\n\nBedi, who died on Monday at age 77, was considered one of the game’s greatest left-arm spinners. He was a connoisseur’s delight, renowned for the classical beauty of his action and his ability to maintain a perfect length over long spells while subtly varying his pace, trajectory and release.\n\n“The fluency of his approach to the wicket was a delight to watch,” said Stacey. “He had the knack of bowling different balls with the same action. He was of a higher class to the bowlers I have faced.”\n\nSingapore finished on 183-8 in the drawn match, after the full Indian Test team, who were on the way home after losing a Test series 2-3 to Australia, declared at 257-5.\n\nP. Ishwarlal, who opened the batting for Singapore and scored 15, said “Bedi’s ball control was phenomenal”.\n\n“I faced six balls from him and was beaten five times,” said the 74-year-old. “From his arm action, it looked like all the balls would land at the same spot and do the same thing. But he had the magical ability to impart great variation and spin, and I found it difficult to read him. All six balls looked like it was coming from a different bowler. He was simply outstanding.”\n\nBedi took 3-15 in 12 overs, before almost the entire Indian team came on to bowl.\n\nThe Straits Times’ former writer Percy Seneviratne observed: “When Bedi came on at the SRC end, with the score on 27, the game moved from placid pace to mesmerising spin. The left-arm spinner had a rich variety, at times making the ball dart off the seam as if possessed and at other times deceiving the batsmen with calculated length and flight.\n\n“The Indian spinner, wearing a mauve turban, tweaked and turned the ball, which the Singapore batsmen found difficult to handle.”\n\nBedi represented India in 67 Tests and 10 ODIs from 1967 to 1979. He was India’s highest wicket-taker in Tests, with 266 at an average of 28.71, at the time of his retirement.\n\nAlong with the unorthodox legspinner Bhagwath Chandrasekhar and offspinners Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Bedi made up the celebrated spin quartet that dominated Indian cricket in the 1970s.\n\nThe charismatic Bedi, who spoke his mind and was admired by players from all over the world, also led India in 22 Tests, winning six, including three overseas.\n\nOn the domestic front, Bedi led Delhi in four Ranji Trophy finals, winning two – in 1978-79 and 1979-80. He also won a third Ranji title, in 1992-93, this time as coach of Punjab, who beat Maharashtra by 120 runs in the final.\n\nFormer Singapore captain and batsman Munish Arora, who was a member of that winning Punjab team, said: “Phaji (Bedi) was a mentor, coach and father figure to me. He not only taught me the skills of the game but also discipline on and off the field.\n\n“After we won the trophy, he and the then Punjab Cricket Association president I.S. Bindra, got us jobs at Punjab Communications in Mohali. I worked there for 10 years before coming to Singapore.”\n\nMunish, who is now 52, is the cricket coach at Global Indian International School.\n\nBedi the coach was uncompromising. On receiving an award from Bedi in 2017, Virat Kohli recounted how the senior focussed on fitness. “Many people have been able to succeed because of that,” said Kohli.\n\nBedi is survived by his wife Anju (nee Inderjit), their daughter Neha and son Angad, as well as his son Gavasinder and daughter Gillinder from his previous marriage to Glenith Miles.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f17df97a57c5b9875cf62711aecce2986cffcc060281646cb4b972a4e34fcd8e?w=825", "alt_text": "Legendary Indian spinner Bishan Bedi bowling to  Singapore batter Stacey Muruthi during the Friendly international at the Padang on Feb 10, 1978."}]}

Eleazar is part of Israel’s elite 13th Golani Brigade.\n\nMenashephoto\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nAnswering the call of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) to fight Hamas are hundreds of Jews who were born in India and migrated to Israel.\n\nIn Jerusalem, 29-year-old Eleazar Chungthang Menashe and more than 200 other Bnei Menashe people, who are from Manipur and Mizoram, went to the frontlines, reported India Today.\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Excellence winner has served in the elite 13th Golani Brigade, a highly decorated infantry unit of the IDF.\n\n“There are about 85,000 Jews of Indian descent in Israel,” Mr Yitzhak (Isaac) Thangjom, executive director of Degel Menashe, told India Today. Degel Menashe helps in the emigration of Jews from Manipur and Mizoram.\n\nBut how did Judaism reach India? And how did a Jewish community survive in north-east India, which has no sea link and no obvious connection with Israel?\n\nAccording to historians, from time immemorial, Jews have found a safe haven in India, where they never faced religious persecution.\n\nThe Jews who settled in India were seen as three distinct groups: Bene Israel, Cochinis and Baghdadis. There was no knowledge about the Bnei Menashe – the Jews of north-east India – until recently.\n\nThe Bene Israel Jews, who mostly settled in the Konkan and Mumbai, are believed to have landed in India after a shipwreck.\n\n“The Bene Israelis came to Alibaug (a coastal town near Mumbai) 2,400 years ago,” said Mr Reuben Israel, a member of the Bene Israel community and Delhi-based publisher. “At the peak of our population, we used to number around 75,000. There are about 4,000 Bene Israelis left in India now.”\n\nThe Cochin Jews came to India in 370 AD from Majorca, off the coast of Spain, and were allowed to settle near Cochin (now Kochi) by a Chera king, according to the book The Jews of India – Their Story by Ms Rachael Rukmini Israel.\n\nThe first Baghdadi Jew settler arrived in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1790. He was joined by other migrants from the Middle Eastern cities of Baghdad, Basra and Aleppo, as well as Yemen, according to the book.\n\nAll these Jews landed and settled on the western coast of India. So how did the Bnei Menashe reach Manipur and Mizoram?\n\n“The Bnei Menashe claim to have been exiled from present-day Israel following the defeat of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BC. They travelled east across Central Asia towards China until finally settling down across the Indo-Burmese trans-border region,” said Mr Vanlalhmangaiha (whose Jewish name is Asaf Renthlei), a sociology researcher from IIT-Delhi, whose PhD thesis is on the Bnei Menashe.\n\nThe Bnei Menashe claims to be one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel, whose ancestors were forced into exile by the Assyrians after they conquered the Kingdom of Israel.\n\n“Bnei means children and Menashe is grandchild,” explains Mr Asaf, referring to the community’s origins in Manasseh, grandchild of Jacob, considered a traditional ancestor of the people of Israel.\n\nBut how did Judaism survive for centuries among the Kuki-Mizo people in Manipur and Mizoram and become known elsewhere only in the 20th century?\n\nThe Bnei Menashe community continues to observe the Sabbath and maintained kosher, according to researchers. “But more than Judaism per se, it was remnants of Judaism that survived among the Kuki-Mizo until the entry of the Christian missionaries at the turn of the 20th century,” said Mr Asaf.\n\n“Ironically, it was the arrival of the Christian missionaries and their translation of the Old Testament into the Mizo language that served as an impetus for the elders in the community to rediscover their Israelite origins. Folktales and cultural practices that resonated with the Israelite practices mentioned in the Bible, along with spiritual revelations, eventually led the inquisitive among them to Judaism.”\n\nSince the Bnei Menashe community rediscovered its Israelite roots, it has adopted all the rituals of Orthodox Judaism. Festivals have been adapted to the Indian context.\n\nIn 1950, Israel’s Parliament (the Knesset) passed the so-called Law of Return, allowing Jews from all over the world to settle in Israel and become its citizens.\n\nThe country has also opened its doors to people like Mr Eleazar, who have discovered their Jewish roots.\n\nMr Eleazar migrated to Israel from Manipur in 2010 with his family.\n\nMr Yitzhak said Jews of Indian descent are spread out all over Israel, but there is a large concentration in Lod and Ramla, both close to Tel Aviv. The Bnei Menashe people live in 14 towns and villages.\n\n“The Baghdadis and Cochinis have all but left India and their numbers are probably in single digits,” said Mr Yitzhak, who settled in Israel in 2008 with his wife and daughter. “The Bene Israel and Bnei Menashe have about 5,000 each. A large majority of the Bnei Menashe people in India have relatives in Israel.”\n\nMr Reuben said Jews who stayed back in India have done so because they are comfortable and have no financial reasons to leave. “They have no difficulty practising Judaism in India. They face no persecution,” he said.\n\nAnd how close-knit are the Jewish communities in India with those in Israel?\n\n“Most of the Bnei Menashe people have close family ties in Israel, and it is a strong transnational community,” said Mr Asaf, adding that transnational ties have grown stronger with the rise of the Internet and social media.\n\nIt is believed that around 200 Bnei Menashe people are actively serving in IDF, in addition to the 200 reservists who have been activated after the recent attacks by Hamas.\n\nIn 2017, 20-year-old Binyamin Tungnung, who had migrated from Manipur, joined the Israeli army and was placed in the same unit as his five friends from India.\n\n“My family’s dream was always to immigrate to Israel and build our future there, and my personal dream was always to serve as a soldier in IDF,” he told Jewish News.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“The Bnei Menashe claim to have been exiled from present-day Israel following the defeat of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BC.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAmong the different ethnic groups in the world, South Asians appear more susceptible to diabetes.\n\nAccording to Diabetes.co.uk, the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes is as much as six times higher in South Asians than in Europeans, with a number of factors – mostly linked to lifestyle – believed to be behind the increased risk.\n\nBut not many look at the role British colonialism has played in this development.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent was subject to many famines from the 18th to 20th centuries, with particularly severe ones occurring under British rule. The raising of taxes, policy failures, resources being deployed to the military and droughts resulted in the deaths of millions.\n\nIn 1943, West Bengal saw the worst of it all, a famine in which up to three million people died of malnutrition. Though the “great famine” in Bengal happened 80 years ago, it has affected subsequent generations, scientists say.\n\nDr Mubin Syed, a 56-year-old radiologist from Ohio in the Unites States, who also works in vascular and obesity medicine, made this link last year and shared it online.\n\nHe explained in his video that South Asians have a tendency to generate and store fat, and not burn it off, with low lean muscle mass, because they are “starvation-adapted”.\n\nEven though the British no longer occupy South Asia, their tepid response to the needs of the local people during long periods of famine continue to have a tangible impact on their health today. Many of the long-term health effects can be explained through the Thrifty Gene Hypothesis, which suggests people were able to better survive famine due to their increased capacity for fat storage.\n\nToday, populations who adapted to carry these genes, which would aid their survival during periods of famine, are more likely to experience obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\nSurviving just one famine doubles the risk of diabetes and obesity in the next generation, according to a study by Brown University in the US. The risk of cardiovascular disease increases 2.7 times for their grandchildren.\n\nDr Syed told HuffPost UK: “Exposure to even one famine has a multi-generational effect of causing metabolic disorders including diabetes, hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular diseases. Imagine having an exposure to at least 24 major famines in a 50-year period.\n\n“In the modern era of abundance, it becomes an evolutionary mismatch. Our adaptation to scarce food availability is no longer suitable for our environment of food abundance. Storing nutrients was an evolutionary response to famine, but now, where scarcity is no longer a problem, it creates a conflict, heightening our risk of certain health conditions.\n\n“Genetics is one issue, but of course, lifestyle is always important. South Asians have to exercise twice as much as Caucasians to get the same health benefits,” said Dr Syed, adding that it does not mean ill health is inevitable for them.\n\n“It’s not a doom and gloom scenario. The risks are avoidable, we just have to pay closer attention to diet, exercise/fitness, sleep, stress and other (factors).”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0360c9e5a25630bdfaf2b35d549581fc7d9ef8d7a91b7bb5b79fd947bb3760a9?w=825", "alt_text": "In 1943, a famine in Bengal killed up to three million people."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nNational Environment Agency (NEA) enforcement officers issued a warning to a diner at Tekka Market and Hawker Centre because he did not clear his glass and drink can when he left the table.\n\nThe clarification by the agency comes after a video was posted on TikTok last Friday of the diner confronting two NEA officers who told him to clean his table.\n\nPatrons of Singapore’s hawker centres, coffee shops and foodcourts are required by law to return their used trays and crockery.\n\nThe video posted by user @khuranasahib_pb04 has amassed more than 320,000 views and been reposted on multiple social media platforms.\n\nIn the video, the diner can be heard asking the officers: “You’re saying to me if I dirty the table, I’m supposed to wipe it?”\n\nOne officer replies that the diner is supposed to clean the table before he leaves.\n\nThe dispute continues as the three argue over what the definition of “cleaning” the table is, with the diner saying that it is his duty to return his tray, crockery and utensils but not wipe the table down.\n\nThe 1min 35sec video ends with the officers insisting that the diner must wipe the table if he had dirtied it while eating. The diner then thanks the officers for the clarification.\n\nThe video raised heated debates online about whether it is fair to expect hawker centre patrons to clean their tables on top of returning their trays.\n\nOne netizen asked what would happen to diners who did not have tissue paper to clean the table. Another asked: “What if the table were dirty in the first place?”\n\nOn Tuesday, NEA said in a Facebook post it was aware of the video being circulated online and encouraged diners to “keep the table clean as a gesture of courtesy to the next diner”.\n\n“While diners are not required to wipe the tables after use, we would like to remind diners that no one should leave behind any litter on or around the tables. These include tissue papers, wet wipes, drink cans, shells and bones,” it said.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/diner-warned-for-not-clearing-glass-1693144?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingaporean Parthiban Murugaiyan’s concert and events production company Maestro Productions has staged only four events in Singapore and one each in London and Toronto. But it has already been called a trendsetter and a mega success.\n\nLast Saturday, it staged the four-hour, sold-out concert High On U1, featuring popular Tamil music composer and singer Yuvan Shankar Raja, at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nThe 11,000-strong audience was treated to a hi-tech, extravagant Indian production showcasing elaborate staging, lighting effects and classy side acts.\n\n“This was something totally new to me,” said 21-year-old undergraduate Pradeep Kumar.\n\n“I just loved it that there was space allocated for people to stand near the stage, where they could see the artiste up close and dance.”\n\nMr Parthiban told tabla! that he started Maestro six years ago to bring in big-name Indian musicians – its debut production featured renowned Tamil film music composer Ilaiyaraaja at The Star Theatre in 2018.\n\n“I soon found that this is a niche target market that has a huge potential to grow to a very big level,” said the 51-year-old managing director of Maestro, who is also chairman and managing director of Ishtara Jewellery in Serangoon Road.\n\n“I realised that it is important to have a high-quality production and cater to what the audience wants.”\n\nThe company has a 10-member core team which includes Mr Parthiban’s wife Jessica, who provides strategic support. All the production and marketing work is done in-house, with employees located in Singapore, London and Toronto.\n\nMr Parthiban pointed out that there is always demand for high-quality music concerts, but event organisers in Singapore often do not package their products well.\n\nMaestro hit pay dirt when a March 4 concert starring wildly popular Indian music producer and singer Anirudh Ravichander at the Singapore Indoor Stadium sold all 12,000 tickets within a day.\n\nIn further proof of Maestro’s knack for understanding what fans really want, ticket-holders to Indian-American singer Sid Sriram’s concert did not give up hope when the show was called off in May 2020 because of the pandemic. Three in five of them still had their tickets when the concert was rescheduled to November last year at The Star Theatre.\n\nA concert organised by Maestro can cost up to $2 million, with a profit margin of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent – what Mr Parthiban describes as “decent money” and an impressive performance that is nothing like his early days in the concert business in 2017.\n\n“I invested $200,000 in a gig, but lost all the money because it failed,” he said.\n\n“I love music and I wanted to diversify. I have been in the jewellery line since I took over the family business from my father when I was 23. But I made the mistake of letting someone else do the show.\n\n“I was hurt but I learnt my lesson. I decided that I would dive deep into the music production business and do the whole thing myself.”\n\nMr Parthiban and his team attended concerts by Taiwanese singer Eric Chou, Singaporean artiste JJ Lin, British rock band Coldplay and K-pop girl group Blackpink. They kept their eyes peeled and picked up valuable tips.\n\n“If you look at what we are doing today, compared to what we were doing when we started, it’s totally a 180-degree change,” he said.\n\nWhile extravagant shows with elaborate staging and lighting effects are the standard at K-pop shows, it is not the case for Indian music gigs in Singapore. So Maestro set out to change that.\n\n“Just pumping in money is not everything in this business,” revealed Mr Parthiban, who was born here and attended Victoria School and Catholic Junior College.\n\n“You have to know what the fans want, the ticket price point, manage the artiste well and know which one will click in this region.\n\n“You have to be creative and make sure it is packaged well, and everything is analysed and perfected along the way. It is not as simple as buying something and selling it.”\n\nMr Parthiban and his team improved the overall concert experience for fans, such as giving them LED wristbands that change colours during the show, and going big on stage set-up and sound quality.\n\nAnirudh’s concert had a 360-degree-view stage – the first in an Indian rock concert in Singapore – and cost three times more than a normal set-up. But the fans loved it, so Maestro used the same concept for Yuvan’s concert.\n\n“If you look at it, the younger generation is very active,” said Mr Parthiban.\n\n“For them, a concert is not just sitting and watching. It’s more like going to a party with friends. For four hours, people want to forget all their problems and enjoy themselves.\n\n“We just focus on what they want, make sure they get the maximum and the best experience. We do not compromise on quality or money.”\n\nThis year, Mr Parthiban has planned five Indian concerts in Singapore, Canada and the United Kingdom. Next year, he will go big by adding Western, K-pop and Bollywood music acts.\n\n“We will be expanding, we will be going to Australia, Dubai, Hong Kong and South Africa,” he said.\n\n“We already have a team working on the new initiative. Soon, we will be announcing a very big event, a music festival. We are moving global and into the mainstream markets.”\n\nWhat about his jewellery business?\n\n“We now have about 10 stores in Singapore and Hong Kong,” said Mr Parthiban, who is also director of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and first vice-president of the Singapore Indian Association.\n\n“I am not taking my eyes off it. It is very capital-intensive, so the expansion will be slow.\n\n“The concept of the music business, on the other hand, is different because it is project-based. You do one project, you make sure you do it well and move on to the next.\n\n“There are fixed costs such as salaries and office maintenance, but they are manageable.\n\n“Next year is going to be hectic as we have signed up a number of artistes, but I’m confident we will do well.”\n\n“I realised that it is important to have a high-quality production and cater to what the audience wants.”\n\nMr Parthiban Murugaiyan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/107abc93183dc7416ad413bbf42a3791b21fa8c184a35f6f153126db4dea5f36?w=825", "alt_text": "(From left) Maestro Productions director Sugumar Gurusaravanan, singer Yuvan Shankar Raja’s wife Zafroon Nisa, Yuvan, Mr Parthiban Murugaiyan and his wife Jessica."}]}

Once the restrictions were lifted, my students were eager to start physical lessons.”\n\nLast year, along with his former student Sarah Shaheeda, a 42-year-old pre-school principal, Mr Sham opened a muay thai gym, Gifted Fight Academy, at Jalan Besar. Today, the gym has more than 100 students enrolled.\n\nApart from teaching muay thai, Mr Sham helps his students become better versions of themselves, instilling discipline and guiding them in finding their purpose in life. “Youth at risk can improve through muay thai. I make sure they do not stray,” said Mr Sham, who pays extra attention to young ex-offenders.\n\nMr Sham partners the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda) to provide muay thai workshops for youth.\n\nNow that his life is “sorted”, Mr sham aims to open more muay thai gyms across the island and look at various business opportunities.\n\nHe also wants to spend quality time with his mother and younger brother Prithiv, who is a former national boxer.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e3e485328ccfd1e27d28e56e17f20db072c93b37d51a61a4dfb471d6643305cc?w=825", "alt_text": "Ex-offender Sham Raaj Elansharan who has started a muay thai gym."}]}

But on Oct 7, when Hamas launched an offensive in Israel, Ms Sabitha Baby and Ms Meera Mohanan became superheroes to the elderly couple under their care.\n\nThe Israeli embassy in New Delhi on Tuesday shared a video of Ms Sabitha detailing the harrowing experience and hailed her and Ms Meera as “Indian Superwomen”.\n\nMs Sabitha said she shielded Mr Ram Shmoulic, 85, and Ms Rahel, 76, when Hamas militants stormed their house in Nir Oz Kibbutz, a town in southern Israel just 2km from the Gaza border.\n\nMs Sabitha and Ms Meera held on to the door handle of the shelter room for almost five hours to prevent the militants from entering. They did not budge even when the militants tried to smash the door open, reported The New Indian Express.\n\nThey exited the shelter room only after Israeli forces secured the area.

We entered the safety room and locked the front and rear doors. We carried Mr Shmoulic, who is very weak due to sclerosis.\n\n“By 7.30am, loud noises were heard outside, and Hamas militants entered our house and started firing at the shelter room.

I called my family in Kannur, my husband and two children, asking them to pray for us,” said Ms Sabitha.\n\n“By 1.30pm, the Israeli Army secured the area, after which we came out. We were shocked to see the house in a dilapidated state.”\n\nMs Rahel’s two wheelchairs, a kettle, Ms Sabitha’s gold and all their passports were stolen.\n\nWhen they came out of the building, they saw bodies everywhere.\n\nThe elderly couple and their caregivers were taken to a hospital.\n\n“We were in the hospital for two days. Now we are in a care home. Mr Shmoulic and Ms Rahel are doing well,” said Ms Meera.\n\nAs the Israel-Hamas conflict intensifies, the nearly 7,000 Malayalees in Israel are living in fear, according to a member of the community.\n\n“The only casualty among us has been a young woman who suffered injuries after a shell fell near the house where she lives as a caregiver,” said Mr Soloman, a member of the Israeli Malayalee Association.\n\n“Unlike in the past, the current situation is serious.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday posted on X that it had filed an official complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) regarding “inappropriate conduct targeted at the Pakistan squad” during the India-Pakistan World Cup match on Oct 14.\n\nPCB did not specify the nature of the incident during the match in which India defeated Pakistan in the much-hyped clash in Ahmedabad. It also said it would make a ‘formal protest’ over the delays in visas for Pakistan journalists who wanted to cover the World Cup.\n\nEarlier, Indian news agency PTI reported that PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf had returned home amid talks of the protest and would hold a series of meetings with senior board officials.\n\n“Ashraf was himself present in Ahmedabad for the match against India and was witness to some incidents which left him unhappy despite the Indian cricket officials’ hospitality during his stay there,” said a source.\n\nPakistan team director and chief coach Mickey Arthur spoke about the crowd behaviour and its impact on his team after the defeat, and ICC chairman Greg Barclay responded that the sport’s world governing body was doing its best to make the World Cup a successful event.\n\nAljazeera reported that there were deafening boos when Pakistan captain Babar Azam took his turn to speak after the toss in the middle of the stadium, and it carried on long after India had inflicted another heavy loss on their neighbours.\n\nThe Pakistani cricketers were at the receiving end of incessant hostilities, it said, and the partisan nature of the crowd became evident as any boundary scored by the Pakistani batters was met with pin-drop silence.\n\nThe source said Ashraf was extremely disappointed with the players’ show against India but told them to forget the Ahmedabad defeat and look forward to their remaining matches.\n\nIndia were the dominant side both with the bowling and batting as Babar’s Pakistan showed no gumption to fight, NDTV Sports reported.\n\nThe clash was pretty much a one-sided affair.\n\nBatting first, Pakistan were all out for 191 with Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav picking up two wickets each. India, boosted by some brilliant batting from Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer, reached the target easily.\n\nAfter the match, Arthur said the atmosphere inside the Narendra Modi Stadium – the biggest cricket stadium in the world, with seats for up to 130,000 people – did not feel like “an ICC event”. “It seemed like a bilateral series, like a BCCI (Indian cricket board) event. I didn’t hear (the patriotic song) Dil Dil Pakistan coming through the microphones too often tonight.”\n\nBut he stressed that the lack of support from the crowd was no excuse for the team’s heavy loss to India.\n\n“So, yes, it played a role but I’m not going to use that as an excuse because for us. It was about living the moment, the next ball and how we were going to combat the Indian players.”\n\nBarclay downplayed the criticism, saying: “Every event that we have, there’s always criticisms from various quarters.\n\n“Let’s see how the whole thing plays out, and we’ll go away and review what can change and do better, how we can improve World Cups and the general offering around cricket.\n\n“We will just take it as it plays out, get to the end of the event. I’m satisfied that it will still be an outstanding World Cup.”\n\nArthur admitted that Pakistan didn’t play fearless cricket on the day. “We were a little bit timid tonight. I would have liked us to really take the game on just a little bit more. It’s a massive occasion, as we know, but I think we just went into our shells a little bit.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“It seemed like a bilateral series, like a BCCI (Indian cricket board) event.

Shanmugam (right).\n\nSpeaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Shanmugam said the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict will have a significant impact across the world, including in Singapore and South-east Asia.\n\n“This is going to be quite a tough period, but our fundamental attitude cannot change. We are all Singaporeans, we have a precious peace within Singapore. We must never let external events affect that.”\n\nHe added that what is happening in the Middle East is going to evoke strong emotions, but Singaporeans must maintain peace.\n\n“There are deep divides in how people are reacting. And as the conflict unfolds, these divides are inevitably going to become deeper,” he said.\n\nMr Shanmugam said these divides are significant, and are often along racial and religious lines.\n\n“The suffering of innocent civilians caught in the conflict is a very emotive one. But in terms of our own religious harmony and understanding, we are in a fairly good position.\n\n“We have open and frank conversations. There is a lot of mutual respect and trust between religious and racial groups, and Singaporeans strongly value our racial and religious diversity and harmony.”\n\nThe minister reiterated Singapore’s support for the two-state solution on Israel-Palestine, which would allow both Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side as independent states.\n\nHe said: “Our position on Israel-Palestine – and support for the two-state solution – is well-known. It has been stated repeatedly.”\n\nIn July, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean met Israeli and Palestinian leaders on a working trip to the region, saying the two-state solution would be the only viable option to achieve a durable, just and comprehensive solution.\n\nThe two-state solution is also consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n\nMr Shanmugam said on Thursday that it is possible to hold strong views on the conflict and yet condemn acts of terrorism.\n\nHe said: “It is possible to deplore how the Palestinians have been treated over the years. It is possible to deeply sympathise with the plight of the Palestinians, and yet still unequivocally condemn the terrorist attacks carried out in Israel.\n\n“These atrocities cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever, whether of fundamental problems or historical grievances.”\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f77ef043a7a327e1baa884c1eda424e55cbf8717fd6b918b7e0299afc8166925?w=825", "alt_text": "Home Minister K.

He also served as the club’s commodore from 1922 to 1927.\n\nThe club found a stretch of mangrove swamp in Tanjong Penjuru on which it built a new clubhouse and had it inaugurated by President Yusof in 1966.\n\nRSYC relocated for the third time in 1999, moving into its current premises at 52 West Coast Ferry Road. The clubhouse offers accommodation for short-term stays. It has guestrooms, restaurants, a bar and other amenities.\n\nRSYC has been instrumental in sea sports events, both recreationally and competitively. The club most notably holds the annual RSYC Regatta, a premier local club yachting event open to all local clubs and marinas.

Krishnan believes he still has a lot to offer to the recreational outfit.\n\nThe 66-year-old has been elected as commodore for a third time this year – when the 1,656-member club is working on upgrading facilities and increasing membership as it gears up for its bicentennial celebration in June 2026.\n\n“We have a masterplan that includes building super yacht berthing facilities, raising funds for a lease extension till 2040 and a bicentenary countdown programme,” said Mr Bala, who became RSYC’s first Indian commodore in 2007.\n\n“I grew up in Pasir Panjang and used to play with my schoolmates at the club when it was still at Pandan Reservoir.\n\n“I was taught sailing, canoeing and other sea sports during an Outward Bound Singapore course in 1974. I fell in love with the sea but did not pick up sailing as I was more into football.\n\n“In 1995, I paid $20,000 to become a member and started to take more interest in the club’s activities. I became a commitee member in 2003.”\n\nMr Bala said he spent his first two terms (2007 to 2009) and (2017 to 2019) as commodore on modernising the club and developing a business strategy, explaining that it was to make the club sustainable.\n\nRSYC, whose clubhouse is next to the West Coast Park, is the world’s sixth-oldest yacht club and the oldest in Asia. It is the only member-owned yacht club in Singapore.\n\nThe committee upgraded the boat storage, increased the number of hotel rooms from 32 to 60 and built more amenities such as a tennis court and restaurant. It also organised social events and regattas.\n\n“We gave back to the community through sailing and other recreational activities for the residents of West Coast, Telok Blangah and Jurong. We raised funds for them and invited them to visit our premises,” said Mr Bala, who is working with his management committee on extending the marine berthing.\n\n“This will mean up to seven more super yachts can berth at our marina. We got the lease from the Singapore Land Authority and the $8 million project should be complete by the end of the year.\n\n“There is a lot of work to be done. I have my day job in the electronics industry and I travel regularly to South Asia, but I still make time for the club activities as it is important that we complete all the projects over the next three years.\n\n“My family – wife, two children and six siblings – are very supportive.”\n\nMr Bala’s commitment to RSYC has not gone unnoticed.\n\n“I have known Bala for many years and he devotes considerable time for the club,” said RSYC honorary secretary Nigel Ho.\n\n“He did not get into the committee to promote himself, but to give to the club. He has vision, experience and knowledge, and his expertise is benefiting the club.”\n\nFormer honorary seceretary and retired marine industry veteran Jimmy Khoo said Mr Bala travels extensively but still finds time to contribute to the club.\n\n“It’s all voluntary work,” explained Mr Khoo.\n\n“But Bala is dedicated and for over 20 years, he has put in a lot of work for the club’s growth and sustainability.”\n\nMr Bala believes RSYC is on the right track, with a year of activities lined up before the bicentenary celebrations to bring to the fore the rich heritage of the club.\n\n“We are not just a club, but there is also a rich heritage,” he said.\n\n“The members should embrace this and be proud.”\n\n“We have a masterplan that includes building super yacht berthing facilities, raising funds for a lease extension till 2040 and a bicentenary countdown programme.”\n\nRSYC commodore Bala B.

Santosh Kumar\n\nKids involved in Ang Mo Kio killer litter incident under investigation\n\nTwo children allegedly involved in throwing a bicycle and a brick-shaped object over the parapet of a Housing Board block are now under police investigation.\n\nIn a video widely shared on social media, a boy can be seen flinging the objects over the parapet while a girl watches.\n\nThe incident took place at 1.36pm on Tuesday, according to a time stamp on the video, which identified the location of the incident as Block 244 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 in its caption.\n\n3m croc spotted on beach to be put down\n\nA crocodile spotted on a beach in Marina East Drive on Tuesday will be put to sleep due to concerns over public safety.\n\nMr How Choon Beng, director of wildlife management and outreach at the National Parks Board, said the 3m-long saltwater croc was trapped and removed from East Coast Park.\n\n“In view of this, the captured crocodile will be humanely put down to safeguard public safety,” added Mr How.\n\nMoney laundering case: President’s Challenge received over $350k in donations\n\nThe Community Chest (ComChest) received $30,000 and the President’s Challenge got more than $350,000 from individuals whose names are similar to those of the people charged in the $2.8 billion money laundering case.\n\nMs Charmaine Leung, managing director of ComChest, the philanthropy and engagement arm of the National Council of Social Service, told The Straits Times on Wednesday that ComChest has since filed police reports and suspicious transaction reports (STRs).\n\nSimilarly, a President’s Challenge spokesman said it filed police reports and STRs, and donations already disbursed to benefiting agencies will not be affected.\n\nReprieve from haze possible during upcoming rainy season\n\nSingapore residents might get a respite from the haze during the rainy season in November and December but the haze risk will remain for some time, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu.\n\nStressing that Singaporeans should not let their guard down, Ms Fu explained that the El Nino conditions that the nation is experiencing could extend beyond a few months.\n\nEl Nino, which brings about hot and dry weather, increases the risk of haze during dry seasons as it could exacerbate fires.\n\n“So, yes, we are talking about something that’s going to last for months,” Ms Fu told The Straits Times.\n\nTherapeutic gardens open in Yishun, Sembawang, Tampines\n\nPeople living in the northern part of Singapore can now enjoy their own green wellness spaces.\n\nTwo therapeutic gardens opened in the north on Wednesday, at Yishun Pond Park and Sembawang Park, each with unique features designed to meet the needs of different users, including seniors, outpatients and children with special needs.\n\nA third such garden opened in the east, at Sun Plaza Park in Tampines, bringing the total number of therapeutic gardens in Singapore to 13.\n\n3 foreigners fined for working illegally as food delivery riders\n\nThree foreigners – two Malaysians and an Indian – were on Tuesday fined between $3,800 and $10,000 for working illegally as food delivery riders in Singapore without valid work passes.\n\nA Singaporean and a permanent resident, who provided the foreigners with account access on the food delivery platforms, were also fined for abetting these offences.\n\nOnly Singaporeans and PRs can legally work as riders for food delivery platforms in Singapore.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/singapore-news-in-brief-1660240?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIt takes one success to recognise another.\n\nInfosys icon N.R. Narayana Murthy at the recent Asia Future Summit described Singapore as the best-governed country in the world. His remarks prompted me to ask Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong a series of questions later at the conference, which was organised by SPH Media to observe the birth centenary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nI asked PM Lee how contemporary Singapore’s founding Prime Minister had set in motion a process that had produced this nation amid a dire international situation. As the fourth generation of Singapore’s leaders prepares to take over the reins, how would current international dissonance mould that generation? Shouldn’t Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s thoughts become almost biblical in dealing with the very nasty secular times that we live in?\n\nPM Lee’s response reiterated the basis of Singapore’s success: hard work that transformed chance into destiny, the fortuitous electoral circumstances that allowed the ruling People’s Action Party to focus on economic and social development without political distraction, and a very high degree of national consensus on what the country had to do to thrive. These fundamentals now needed to be built upon in the face of new challenges.\n\nTurning my extempore metaphor of biblical heritage into an idiom of contemporary possibilities, PM Lee said: “We are in the Garden of Eden state... and if you leave this, you are not going to come back in again. And our job is to try very hard to make people understand that and to work together to keep it going for as long as we can.\n\n“We were lucky. We now have this tremendous asset and a difficult environment, and we have to make the most of it to make Singapore succeed in a very changed world.”\n\nIn a nutshell, Singapore needs to renew what India’s founding Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru called “a nation’s tryst with destiny” (in the context of Indian independence).\n\nI dare say Mr Murthy would agree with PM Lee’s unsentimental realism. Infosys has come a long way to being almost everywhere that counts and Singapore has become a First World city-state without which Asia’s economic and political structure cannot be imagined.\n\nHad Singapore not come this far, Infosys would not have set foot here. Had Infosys failed, Singapore would not have been in need of the Infosys footprint.\n\nMr Murthy is not given to hyperbole. He has the unsentimental job of ensuring that his company does not fall victim to circumstance. Equally, PM Lee and his party do not govern through the swaying power of rhetoric.\n\nThey need to be in charge of Singapore’s response to its external environment, particularly when it turns hostile because of great-power rivalry (such as the soured relations between the United States and China), the economic consequences of strategic dissonance (economic decoupling that disrupts supply chains for other countries), and the general feeling of ill-will from the falling out between chief pillars of the global system.\n\nFor both Singapore and Infosys, realism is the name of the game.\n\nIt is through the combo of cautionary political realism and economic radicalism that Mr Lee Kuan Yew turned a teeming cesspool of a colony into one of the iconic assertions of Asian independence and success. Looking ahead, his vision must continue to guide Singapore’s policy choices, although how it does so will depend on circumstantial options.\n\nWhile Singaporeans need to sign on to the realism needed to take the country forward, its minorities must have an instinctive understanding of what they should do to be a part of the national effort.\n\nThe rule in Eden that forbade Adam and Eve from eating from the Tree of Knowledge does not apply to a knowledge-driven economy such as Singapore’s. Rather, it is in the temptation of tasting a dangerous unknown that the danger lies.\n\nEthnic-identity politics, the misuse of religion for political ends, fake news, devious narrowcasting on social media by exploiting algorithms – these are all intimations of an unknown that sells itself as liberating knowledge in a world characterised by dissonance and the distrust of legitimate authority.\n\nSingapore is subjected to the interplay of events lying outside its control and sometimes beyond the comprehension of its more impressionable citizens. The orchestrated use of online disinformation from abroad to align the opinions of segments of its population with the interests of one foreign power or the other is a recognised phenomenon of Singapore life.\n\nThe people must be aware of and resist the temptations of what I would call “ethnicised news and views” to abjure siren calls from abroad to become a part of some religious project or the other, news of which seeks to rationalise itself as the normal communication of ethnic information.\n\nEverybody has a stake in the continued well-being of Singapore.\n\n“We are in the Garden of Eden state... and if you leave this, you are not going to come back in again.”\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ec1e6199410ea40f5160bf47d401765642c9bd0cf7c470767ed2c81d37326069?w=825", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong with moderator, Editor-in-Chief Wong Wei Kong, at the Asia Future Summit 2023 closing dialogue."}]}

There may be film starts present, maybe even involved in the programme.\n\nThe timing is uncertain, it might be before the toss. Or between the toss and the first ball, maybe between innings.\n\nThere’s a 50-50 chance that Pakistani reporters might race across the border and into the press box in time. But the chance of Pakistan flags being waved is close to zero.\n\nThe India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is unlike any other and pulls in massive viewership. Both sides have rich cricketing histories, and although they have outdone each other countless times, India dominate in the 50-overs World Cup, having won all seven matches.\n\nSome electrifying action is expected tomorrow. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is gearing up for it, while Gujarat Cricket Association secretary Anil Patel said that gold-ticket holders – Sachin Tendulkar, Rajinikanth and Amitabh Bachchan – will be among the many VIPs.\n\nSecurity has been beefed up in the city and the administration announced that more than 11,000 security personnel will be deployed at the stadium.\n\nAs the archrivals get ready to face each other on Indian soil after seven years, nearly all accommodations have been snapped up as more than 40,000 out-of-station fans are expected in the city.\n\nThe Pakistan team last visited Ahmedabad in 2012, and after initially deciding to postpone his trip, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Zaka Ashraf announced that he would travel to India to watch the big game.\n\nEarlier, about 60 Pakistani media personnel were waiting for their visa to cross the border and cover the event, forcing Ashraf to take up the matter with the Pakistan foreign office.\n\n“I delayed my travel to India, travelling only tomorrow after receiving confirmation that Pakistan’s journalists have been asked to submit their passports to obtain visas to cover the mega event,” he said.\n\nOn the field, Pakistan had a perfect start to the tournament, winning both their games. Ashraf said: “I am extremely pleased with the way the players have performed. The PCB management committee and the entire nation stand firmly behind the players for a successful campaign.”\n\nPakistan pulled off the highest chase in World Cup history when they defeated Sri Lanka on Oct 10, and batting hero Mohammad Rizwan, who scored 131 not out, said the team will go with the same plan against India: playing with belief.\n\nIndia, who too have won both their matches, look well-settled, with their batsmen in top form.\n\nThey just have to decide whether to play the recently-recovered Shubman Gill as opener and replace all-rounder Shardul Thakur with off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/71e33605065773966250c590977284da7b21bd7cf44204da6ab8ec1e1821e904?w=825", "alt_text": "India’s captain Rohit Sharma and his Pakistani counterpart Babar Azam."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndia’s modest Olympic achievements have long stood in contrast to its massive population, but sporting officials say the sleeping giant has finally stirred at the Asian Games.\n\nFive years ago in Jakarta, India finished eighth on the medal table with their best-ever haul of 70 medals, including 16 golds.\n\nIn Hangzhou last week, Team India finished with 107 medals, soaking up glowing reports in national media and praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAfter being topped by the likes of Taiwan, Uzbekistan and Indonesia in Jakarta, India were fourth on the medal table, behind China, Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe last time it was higher up the table at the Asian Games was in 1962, when it finished third. At the first Asian Games in 1951, India had finished second.\n\nAnd this is the first time India has broken into the top five after 1986. Its worst position was in 1990 when it stood 11th out of the 36 countries that participated.\n\nWith 45 nations, the Asian Games offers far weaker competition than the Olympics and features plenty of medals in sports that have little prospect of making the Olympic programme.\n\nIndia managed seven medals, including one gold, at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, the nation’s record haul putting it at only 48th on the table.\n\nYet the trajectory is positive and results in Hangzhou show that increased funding with more targeted sports investment in recent years is paying dividends, India team officials told Reuters.\n\n“Our prime minister wants India to become a sporting power, so the government provides incentives and (we are) using foreign coaches,” said Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president P.T. Usha.\n\n“The government is doing it in a system that started three, four years ago. We are starting to get the results now.”\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Modi praised the progress made in strengthening India’s sports culture, saying: “In the past nine years, a new era of sports emerged in India. It is not just about making India a new power in sports but empowering society through sport.”\n\nThe Central government has hugely increased India’s sports budget since 2014, from Rs874 crore ($143 million) in 2014 to Rs2,462 crore. Best-performing athletes are also given an annual allowance of Rs500,000.\n\nAthletes now train in the best facilities in India and abroad, all of which are funded by the government.\n\nBadminton star P.V. Sindhu told The New Indian Express last year: “We don’t have to worry about our training, getting the right coaches, sports science support or specialised training equipment.”\n\nIn August this year, Mr Modi said the government is setting up the Khelo India State Centres of Excellence.\n\nHe directed all state sports ministers to ensure that no sporting talent is overlooked and that more local competitions and tournaments are to be held in the country. States have been asked to identify goals and focus on sports infrastructure and tournament-specific training.\n\nIndian athletics made strides in Hangzhou, claiming 29 medals – nine better than Jakarta.\n\nAthletes have surprised in a number of events, including Kishore Jena, who took javelin silver behind teammate Neeraj Chopra, the country’s first Olympic and world champion in track and field events.\n\nThe men’s 4x400m relay team cruised to victory on Wednesday, after the world championships in Budapest where they set a new Asian record on the way to a fifth-place finish in the final.\n\n“These are healthy signs of an emergent Asian sports power,” said sports lawyer Nandan Kamath, who was involved in drafting the Indian government’s Target Olympic Podium Scheme.\n\n“There has been consolidation and growth in disciplines like shooting and athletics, and the emergence of winners and contenders in new disciplines.”\n\nIndia have a long way to go to catch up with China and had no hope of doing so in Hangzhou, where the hosts finished with a record 201 golds and 383 medals.\n\nBut there is no shortage of optimism. “In the near future, we will chase China,” said India’s chef de mission Bhupender Singh Bajwa, adding that the target now is to double their Tokyo Olympics medal haul at Paris next year.\n\nReuters, Indo-Asian News Service\n\n“There has been consolidation and growth in disciplines like shooting and athletics, and the emergence of winners and contenders in new disciplines.”\n\nSports lawyer Nandan Kamath", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9c0200c6524bc13a48ec5e89c02dc4f316751075104db17246772dcf4f038744?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian shuttlers Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty celebrating after winning the men’s doubles final."}]}

Located near the central business district, it has a team of four full-time Indian doctors and two visiting doctors who shuttle between the two countries.\n\nSensing that there was a shortage of quality healthcare facilities in Rwanda, the group set up Wiwo in 2017, according to the hospital’s chief operating officer Anees Ahmed.\n\n“We did not want to promote medical tourism, for patients to travel to India for treatment, so we set up a facility here to cater to these patients,” said the 50-year-old, adding that patients from east-Africa countries are willing to travel to Rwanda for medical services.\n\nIndians living in other countries in Africa have also been moving to Rwanda because it is safer, cleaner and less corrupt.\n\nMr Dinesh Parwani, managing director of agricultural firm ETG Inputs, moved his family to Rwanda after 12 years in Tanzania and three years in Zambia, as Rwanda’s security trumps that of the other two countries.\n\nNow, in addition to a sizeable temple and the celebration of Indian festivities, there are at least 15 popular Indian restaurants in the city.\n\nKhana Khazana executive chef Digpal Singh Rana said the locals have developed a soft spot for Indian dishes such as chicken tikka masala and chicken lollipop.\n\n“But we have to tone down the spices,” said the 42-year-old, who left Dehradun in India in 2009 to move to Rwanda.\n\nAditi Bharade is a journalism student at Nanyang Technological University’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.

The annual awards are given to Indian students who excel in studies, sports or the arts.\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman gave out the awards in the first session, while the honours were done by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Finance and National Development and Sinda president Indranee Rajah in the second.\n\nThe recipients this year, ranging from PSLE students to local and overseas bachelor’s degree graduates, received between $150 and $500.\n\n“Students should not just stop excelling in academics after receiving this award,” said Ms Indranee.\n\n“They should show hunger for more opportunities and continue to learn new things and widen their horizons. Apart from studies, I also encourage the students to join hands with Sinda and actively serve the community.”\n\nSinda CEO Anbarasu Rajendran felt it was “a proud moment in the history of the award ceremony”.\n\n“The number of Indian students performing well makes me feel that Sinda has done its part to ensure no child is left behind in our programmes and initiatives,” he said.\n\n“It’s even more heartening to see that 99 students from this year’s cohort have been involved in one or more of Sinda programmes and initiatives.”\n\nMs Suthershinii paid tribute to her father, who she said was her biggest inspiration, prioritising the family members’ needs and encouraging her to explore her full potential.\n\nMs Suthershinii, a research assistant in the Infectious Diseases Department at the Duke-NUS graduate medical school, is passionate about science and hopes to use it to benefit mankind.\n\nAlthough she has quit competitive sports and plays only recreational badminton, she is active, doing voluntary work with the Children’s Cancer Foundation, and is education director at the non-profit Grow Education.\n\nAward winner G.

Santosh Kumar\n\nHow did Singapore’s 200m Asian Games gold winner get the name Shanti?\n\n“My pregnancy with Shanti was very peaceful compared to my pregnancy with her three older siblings,” her mother Jeet Pereira, 63, told tabla! yesterday.\n\n“I could work till full term without problems. I could carry heavy items and move things around.\n\n“She gave me peace, so I gave her that name. She is a lovely kid, who never caused any trouble.”\n\nShanti is Sanskrit for peace.\n\nJeet and Clarence Pereira, 66, gave their four children Indian names – Shobana, 38; Anand, 36; Seema, 33; and Shanti, 27.\n\n“It is important because in Singapore you need cultural identity,” said Clarence.\n\n“My family name is Pereira and I was born in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, before coming over to Singapore when I was a few months old. But in school, I was called Eurasian.\n\n“I kept telling them I am a Malayalee but they kept saying I was Portuguese. I had to show them my identity card to prove that that I am Indian.”\n\nJeet’s parents immigrated from Amritstar in Punjab in the 1950s. She was born in Singapore – like all her children.\n\nDespite being a “quiet” kid, Shanti had plenty of energy, said her mother. “When Seema ran for her school, Shanti would always go to the stadium to watch the race but she would not remain still for long. She was always running, up the hill or nearby areas.”\n\nJeet added that she was a 200m sprinter in school but could not progress as she did not have a coach, and she did not want the same fate to befall Shanti. So Jeet and Clarence did everything they could to give Shanti their full support after she decided to join the Singapore Sports School.\n\nShanti’s sprinting prowess was discovered at age nine, by her CHIJ (Katong) Primary School coach.\n\n“I had to travel a lot, so Jeet was providing the guidance,” said Clarence, an oil industry consultant.\n\n“Every time Shanti did well, we encouraged her to do even better. She started to love athletics and it soon became her passion.\n\n“I told her not to go to the Sports School because it would be difficult for her to become a star there with all the champions, but she insisted on going.”\n\nShanti’s parents gave her their full support, encouraging her to create a career in sport – atypical of Indian parents.\n\n“That might have been the case in India, but we think differently as Singaporeans. It is important for parents to understand what their children believe in and what they want,” said Clarence.\n\n“Shanti chose the Sports School and we gave her our blessings. We took her to training, provided healthy meals and watched her races.”\n\nWhen Shanti went through a rough patch in 2017 and 2018, and her form dipped, her parents came to her rescue. She was under a lot of pressure as self-doubt crept in and many wrote her off.\n\n“We supported Shanti psychologically,” said Clarence. “The period was difficult, but it did Shanti a lot of good as she emerged more determined and mentally strong. She developed this ‘never mind’ attitude, which stands her in good stead.”\n\nShanti’s parents said she is disciplined, organised and goodhearted.\n\n“She loves to giggle. Even if something’s not funny, she would laugh aloud. She laughs heartily,” said Jeet.\n\n“She is helpful, doesn’t like to cause trouble and abhors gossip. She has learnt to absorb pressure and find solutions from within.”\n\nAt home, Shanti is mostly busy packing and unpacking, as she often travels to races.\n\n“She’s very disciplined with her meals. She is also particular about what she consumes before bed and what time she sleeps,” Jeet, a childcare educator, added.\n\n“She’s up early and goes for training. She comes back and takes short naps. She also likes watching programmes on the tablet or television.\n\n“She makes time for church and her (paternal) grandma. When the family needs her, she makes sure she’s there.”\n\nAlthough she has now become an “international star”, Shanti is still Shanti.\n\n“We always remind her to be humble and not to ignore anyone. We tell her to have her feet on the ground,” said Clarence, adding that it is he and his wife who have changed.\n\n“We have to watch our moves as we are also being watched. It can be quite hard for us as we are simple people. We like to joke and laugh, but now we have to watch what we say – there are always photographers, reporters and other people watching us.”\n\nShanti, who arrived in Singapore yesterday, will leave on a well-deserved holiday tomorrow. Later in the year, she will start preparing for next year’s Olympics in Paris, where she has qualified for the 200m race.\n\n“How far she will go in Paris, only she can tell,” said Clarence.\n\n“We can only watch and guide her, along with her boyfriend (former national sprinter Tan Zong Yang), coach (Luis Cunha)  and Singapore Athletics officials.\n\n“She has all the support that she needs. We will be very happy if she makes it to the semi-final.”\n\nShanti Pereira with her Asian Games gold and silver medals Oct 5.\n\nPHOTO: THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nShanti Pereira with her parents after winning the historic 200m gold in Hangzhou, China.\n\nPHOTO: THE STRAITS TIMES\n\n“She gave me peace, so I gave her that name.

Santosh Kumar\n\nDavid Beckham and Ronaldo caused a stir at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\n\nNot because the two football stars made an appearance but because their namesakes are members of India’s cycling team.\n\nLast week, David Beckham Elkatohchoongo, 20, and Ronaldo Laitonjam Singh, 21, sped around the steeply banked curves of the Chun’an Jieshou Sports Centre Velodrome.\n\nWhile Ronaldo lost to Japan’s Shinji Nakano in the last-16 of the men’s individual sprint, Beckham lost to Malaysia’s Muhammad Shah Firdaus in the quarter-final of the same event. He finished eighth overall, and 11th in the men’s keirin.\n\nRonaldo and Beckham, both from Manipur, were also part of the men’s team that lost to Japan in the sprint first round.\n\n“My father was a national footballer and a huge fan of Beckham,” Elkatohchoongo explained.\n\n“I am also a big fan because he was such a good player.”\n\nOne might think that with a name like that, Elkatohchoongo would have become a footballer.\n\n“I played football when I was 14 years old,” he said.\n\n“I switched to cycling in 2017 and started my professional cycling career in Delhi five years ago.”\n\nBut not all the attention he gets because of his name has been positive.\n\nWhen he flew to England for the Birmingham Commonwealth Games last year, Elkatohchoongo was stopped by immigration officials who conducted a thorough check on his passport before letting him through.\n\n“When I got to the airport, the officer said, ‘Is that really your name, David Beckham? You are lying, you are not David Beckham.’ He then looked at my ID before he was convinced that my real name is really David Beckham.”\n\nLaitonjam Singh’s father was also a football fan but his idol was not Cristiano Ronaldo. He was an ardent fan of the Brazilian wizard Ronaldinho.\n\nHe had named his son Ronaldo – not that far off since Ronaldinho translates to “little Ronaldo” – as he got news of the baby’s birth immediately after Ronaldinho scored the winning goal against England in the 2002 World Cup quarter-final.\n\n“I must have been born just as the ball got into the net,” Laitonjam Singh told The Hindu newspaper.\n\n“My dad, who was in Kashmir for work, won his bet against his friends that day. He thought I brought him luck.\n\n“He was a great inspiration to me. He put in a lot of work so that I could become an international medallist. He died in 2017.

Now that the pipes have been replaced, Mr Nejamdeen said he was glad that the issue had been sorted out. “The best thing for us is the change to the drainage system because that was an issue we were facing for quite a while.”\n\nMr Nejamdeen, who took the opportunity in the last three months to travel to India and Malaysia, is looking forward to returning to resume his business. “The changes have enhanced the market and will bring in better business for us,” he said.\n\nMr Antony Raj, 43, a tailor on the\n\nfirst floor\n\nsecond storey, where renovations were completed on Aug 31, is happy with improvements to the centre’s ventilation.\n\n“The fans were smaller, and it would get very hot. It is more comfortable now with the new and bigger fans,” he said in Tamil.\n\nThe owner of seafood stall Lee Yit Huat Trading, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, said he hopes there will no longer be a problem with birds.\n\n“Many would come in to look for food and there would be a lot of droppings. Now there is a netting, I hope this will make things better,” said the 60-year-old.\n\nMr Lee moved his business to the market in Toa Payoh Lorong 4 during the three months that Tekka was closed.\n\nIn response to ST’s queries, a Tanjong Pagar Town Council spokesman said the 216 market stalls, 119 hawker stalls and 68 lock-up stalls at Tekka were at full occupancy three months ago. At present, occupancy is at 96 per cent.\n\nRents were waived while the works were carried out, and the National Environment Agency said earlier that there would be no rental increase because of the works.\n\nMr Tan said that among the feedback from residents and hawkers was a wish for Tekka to be a clean space. “Our town council, cleaners and hawker association are doing what they can to keep this place clean. But we need everybody to play their part, so that a fresh, new Tekka Centre will remain clean, fresh and welcoming for residents and visitors.”\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nTailor Antony Raj at his shop at Tekka Centre.\n\nPHOTO: THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nThe renovated Tekka Centre reopened on Oct 1.\n\nPHOTO: BERITA HARIAN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/tekka-market-back-in-business-after-facelift-1625893?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMahatma Gandhi’s words, “There are people in the world so hungry that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread”, signify an era that began well before India’s independence, but, unfortunately, survived well into the 1960s.\n\nIn that era of famines and food shortages appeared Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan –the agronomist, agricultural scientist and plant geneticist, whose ability to optimise crop productivity helped produce India’s Green Revolution.\n\nProfessor M.S. Swaminathan was not God but the revolution he created brought material salvation right into the homes of the poor and hungry.\n\nWhen he died in Chennai at the end of last month, aged 98, Prof Swaminathan left the world indebted to the role of singular scientists in changing the destiny of humans, nations and states by moving mortals beyond fatalism to hope through the rational and ethical control of nature.\n\nThe Green Revolution saw grain production soar: Wheat yields increased from 800kg per ha in the 1960s to more than 2,800kg per ha by the early 2000s. Rice yields grew at a similar pace.\n\nBut in his later years, Prof Swaminathan was not contended with the term Green Revolution, preferring Evergreen Revolution, one which would be ecologically viable by avoiding dependence on the chemical fertilisers and pesticides required by the Green Revolution. It would focus on sustainable farming and on native plant varieties that would suit resource-poor farmers in India and other developing countries.\n\nThis was the whole point of Prof Swaminathan’s efforts: to indigenise science in the service of agriculture.\n\nHe was a close associate of the Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug, an American geneticist and plant pathologist whose work in Mexico produced spectacular successes in finding high-yielding and disease-resistant wheat.\n\nMr Borlaug’s mission was to provide breathing space in the war against hunger and deprivation in order to deal with global population growth. Prof Swaminathan used such scientific advances made elsewhere to seek a specific answer to India’s own problems with low agricultural productivity amid a population explosion.\n\nScience is universal but geography is not. The topographical identity of India demanded scientific solutions that were related to the nature of the soil, rainfall patterns and the countervailing agency of irrigation.\n\nProf Swaminathan’s success in India, and India’s success because of him, led to an American publication acclaiming him as one of the 20 most influential Asians of the 20th century and one of the only three from India, the other two being Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme described him as the Father of Economic Ecology.\n\nHis life-work lives on in the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation. He founded it in 1988 as a not-for-profit trust with proceeds from the first World Food Prize he received in 1987.\n\nThe foundation aims to accelerate the use of modern science and technology for agricultural and rural development to improve the lives and livelihoods of communities.\n\nIt follows a pro-poor, pro-women and pro-nature approach and applies appropriate science and technology options to address practical problems faced by rural populations in agriculture, food and nutrition. The foundation benefits 550,00 households and 250,00 fisheries in 4,000 villages across 14 Indian states, and its influence is seen in 18 countries.\n\nProf Swaminathan’s legacy continues the tradition of Mr Borlaug’s work in Mexico, which led to revolutionary yields produced by new wheat in India and Pakistan and to its fruitful adoption in several Latin American, West Asian and African countries.\n\nThe Green Revolution played a crucial role as well in determining the global space occupied by India. In the 1960s, the country had come to depend on food aid brought in by ships, which led Prof Swaminathan to bemoan India’s “ship-to-mouth existence”.\n\nSuch existence exacted a price in both economic and diplomatic terms. A case in point is the PL-480, a law passed by the United States Congress under which America shipped billions of dollars in foodgrains to India against rupee payments.\n\nThe rupee-priced imports did help to feed the Indian people, but only because they also helped the US to profitably dispose of farm surpluses generated by price supports. American shippers did booming business, since half of all PL-480 shipments had to be carried on American vessels.\n\nIn 1971, India decided to cancel all grain imports from the US even before the expiry of the existing PL-480 agreement. The move demonstrated Indian resolve to not succumb to American pressure over India’s support for the liberation movement in East Pakistan that led to the birth of Bangladesh, and for daring to upgrade its diplomatic representation in North Vietnam to the embassy level – a move that would endear India to the unified Vietnam which would appear within the decade.\n\nIt is difficult to see how India could have acted so boldly on the foreign front without the degree of agricultural sufficiency produced by the Green Revolution.\n\nToday, India does not depend on ship-to-mouth imports. Instead, it exports wheat and rice across the world. India’s agricultural coming of age underpins its global presence.\n\nThis is not to say that every Indian enjoys equitable access to food. That would have been\n\nbeloved\n\nProf Swaminathan’s dream. However, he would still be happy that his country has\n\nescaped\n\ncome so far from its ship-to-mouth existence.\n\nGod did appear in the form of bread.\n\nAsad Latif is an editorial writer for\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nProf M.S.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAs the cricket World Cup gets underway in India, Rohit Sharma’s team faces immense pressure from fans demanding an end to their drought in international titles.\n\nThey see India’s thumping win in the recent Asia Cup as just an appetiser.\n\nIndia’s last major tournament win was the 2013 Champions Trophy, after Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s team lifted the 2011 World Cup in Mumbai.\n\nNow the nation of 1.4 billion dreams big again, as it hosts the tournament this year. The last two editions were also won by hosts, Australia in 2015 and England in 2019.\n\nVeteran sports journalist Ayaz Memon said it is tough to predict a winner for the 10-team tournament as it is a “very interesting and close contest” but the host, fresh from winning the Asia Cup, remains one of the favourites.\n\n“Fan expectations are high,” said Memon, who witnessed India’s first World Cup triumph under Kapil Dev 40 years ago.\n\n“We have had disappointments and heartbreaks because we lost the semi-finals in 2015 and 2019. There is a high expectation now because the team looks very good on paper.”\n\nIndia will begin their campaign against Australia on Oct 8, followed by a hotly-anticipated clash against arch-rivals Pakistan at the world’s biggest cricket stadium, in Ahmedabad.\n\nA match involving India, which has superstars including Virat Kohli and Rohit, draws millions of fans – a winner for the broadcasters and sponsors.\n\n“With this particular World Cup, we think we have a fantastic chance because India playing at home is a tough side to beat,” Rakesh Patel, founder of the popular fan group Bharat Army, told AFP.\n\n“And we think it’s our time to win a World Cup again.”\n\nSupporters, who travel vast distances across India to watch their stars live, expect nothing short of a title win for the top-ranked team.\n\n“We are very excited,” said Patel, who is travelling from London to see his team.\n\n“Going into this World Cup, if you look at our performances against Australia and the recent Asia Cup, we have a batting line-up that is very well-settled.”\n\nIndeed, Rohit has all his frontline players back and raring to go as the hosts look to repeat their 2011 success on home soil.\n\nRohit and Shubman Gill have formed a profitable opening partnership, with the inimitable Kohli waiting in the wings at No. 3. India also have players like Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav, who can come up with match-winning performances.\n\nTheir star-studded batting line-up is backed by a speedy pace attack led by Jasprit Bumrah, with left-arm wristspinner Kuldeep Yadav likely to provide the X-factor.\n\nIndia could not have asked for a better build-up, steam rolling Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final last month, then beating Australia 2-1 in an ODI home series.\n\nSri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan told the industan Times: “India have a better chance of winning the World Cup. They are the home team, they know the wicket. But who knows, maybe there is an underdog!”\n\nMuralitharan said spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will be “crucial for Team India”.\n\n“I think (Rohit) will also do well. Another player to watch out for is (all-rounder) Hardik Pandya,” he added.\n\nIndia’s national obsession with cricket began in 1983 when Kapil’s underdogs stunned the West Indies in the final at Lord’s. Suddenly the sport had many takers, including sponsors.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, Dhoni’s winning six against Sri Lanka to win the crown at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium triggered a nationwide celebration in what turned out to be cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar’s last World Cup.\n\nSpinner Harbhajan Singh said the night of that win remains the most special moment of his life, and he hopes for another Indian victory in this year’s final on Nov 19 in Ahmedabad.\n\nBut former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar felt India will have to overcome the pressure from millions of fans to come up trumps, and said a dream final would be against Pakistan.\n\n“India will be playing in front of their crowd at home and the match will be broadcast around the world,” Akhtar told Star Sports.\n\n“All this pressure will be on India, not on us. If India come out of this pressure to win the World Cup in India against Pakistan, then the galaxy is the limit for the Indian team.”\n\nAFP, Indo-Asian News Service\n\nChildren standing in front of a billboard displaying Indian cricketers Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja, outside Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\n“If India come out of this pressure to win the World Cup in India against Pakistan, then the galaxy is the limit for the Indian team.”\n\nFormer Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/lifestyle/sports-fitness/e28098fantastic-chancee28099-for-india-to-win-cup-1625896?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

She was in Dubai with her family to attend a wedding.\n\nBoney told The New Indian: “It was not a natural death, it was an accidental death. I had decided not to speak about it because I spoke about it for almost 24 or 48 hours when I was being investigated and interrogated.\n\n“The officers said we had to do it because there was a lot of pressure from Indian media.

They’re all Indian. This is kind of reverse racism. Are you saying fair Indians are not Indians? How do we define what an Indian looks like?

By the 1980s and 90s,\n\nreported BBC. That was the time when\n\nthe young also began watching Cartoon Network and MTV, listening to Backstreet Boys and plastering posters of Spice Girls in their rooms.\n\n“Archie Comics gave me my first taste of Americana. In fact, my idea of what American fast foods like hot dogs or burgers should look like came from there,” Mumbai-based Fiero Fernandes, an early fan, told the BBC.\n\nComic Con India founder Jatin Varma said: “When it came to foreign comics, there was Tintin and Asterix, but it was Archie that really painted a picture of what life was supposed to be like for a youngster in America.\n\n“The storylines were carefree and clean. I guess that’s why parents didn’t mind their children reading these comics, even though it showed people going on dates or kissing or wearing bathing suits at the beach.”\n\nThe peppy vibe of the comic and its distinctive characters influenced many subsequent young-adult shows and films.\n\nBollywood director Karan Johar reportedly admitted that his 1998 blockbuster, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, was partly inspired by Archie Comics.\n\nThe comic had simple plotlines, the main one being a love triangle between three of the lead characters. Some plots discussed typical teenage issues, including limited pocket money, boredom, academic challenges and romance. A major draw was the titular character and his gang of friends.\n\nBut by the time\n\nWhile the comic\n\nbecame\n\nremained popular in India, it\n\nhad gone\n\nwent out of fashion in\n\nAmerica\n\nthe West.\n\nIn recent years, publishers have tried to reinvent Archie Comics by adding diverse characters and exploring darker plot lines. But Indian fans appear to be torn over these new offerings.\n\nSome like Reneysh Vittal said they miss the playfulness and simplicity of the older Archie Comics. “Our generation was lucky enough to experience life just before the Internet took over and for me, Archie Comics will always represent that pre-Internet age of innocence,” he told the BBC.\n\nBut Tejas Menon, who runs a pop-culture podcast and is also one of the singers in The Archies musical, says there will always be an audience for Archie. “There’s something about a coming-of-age story. It never fails to touch a chord because we’ve all experienced it. When told through iconic characters like Archie and his gang, there’s bound to be some magic there.”\n\nZoya told Film Companion: “When I was asked to adapt this, I didn’t want to do a modern take. Firstly, Riverdale has done it. Secondly, it’s not my experience of Archies.\n\n“My experience of Archies is of a simpler, more innocent and gentler time, where less was more. I wanted to go back to that. I wanted to keep the essence of the comic and find a way for it to resonate with young adults today.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\nA screengrab from The Archies teaser.\n\nThe Archies will hit Netflix on Dec 7.\n\nPHOTO: NETFLIX\n\n“My experience of Archies is of a simpler, more innocent and gentler time, where less was more.

The 55-year-old was one of the biggest draws of Esplanade’s Kalaa Utsavam - Indian Festival of Arts, which ran from Nov 17 to 26.\n\nThe 90-minute show, scripted by fellow comedian Sharul Channa, was replete with raunchy and risque jokes about race and sex.\n\nIf any among the crowd were expecting a wholesome family affair, they would have left the theatre red-faced, after squirming in their seats at the not-so-subtle sexual innuendos.\n\nDressed in full “sari” regalia for the first half of the show, Kumar never shied away from the racy stuff. Recounting his recent trip to Australia, he opined that Sydney was overwhelmingly “gay”, and smelled most notably of “protein”.\n\n“The slower ones need to catch up, yah,” he told the audience, after it was apparent some didn’t quite catch the unsavoury punchline.\n\nLocal politicians weren’t spared either, as Kumar roasted ministers Edwin Tong and Ong Ye Kung for their, uhm, looks. (Lawrence Wong, in his book, is one of the better looking members of the Cabinet, apparently.)\n\nBut the comedian’s quick wit and sass were best exemplified whenever he tossed away the script momentarily to roast audience members in the front rows.\n\nWoe to whomever he pointed to and asked “Sir, where are you from?”\n\nOne gentleman who attended the show alone wasn’t spared from the inevitable mockery.

For instance, users can type “make the sound of a barking dog with a huge waterfall behind it”, and the system will produce the sound within a second.\n\nThis advanced approach holds significant promise for accurately detecting the mental health of patients, and even contributing to a nuanced understanding of child behaviour in early education settings.\n\nProf Poria’s work is funded by several government agencies. He is currently trying to create LLMs that do not “hallucinate” (generate unfaithful answers), and are safe to use, accessible and adaptable.\n\n“Soujanya’s contributions to the multimodal conversational AI has been nothing short of spectacular,” said SUTD President Chong Tow Chong. “The research he is currently undertaking could significantly improve the ability of computers to interpret complex data and provide valuable information to users. We look forward to many more breakthroughs in his AI research.”\n\nFor his contribution to the field of science, Prof Poria was awarded the Young Scientist Award at the President’s Science and Technology Awards last month, the highest accolade for research scientists and engineers in Singapore.\n\nFor his extensive work in AI, he was also recently ranked 441 among more than 356,000 scientists in the world by Stanford University.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b3bc180609cd6bf286336b852d59bc23536739c22995712ce908c71c8ebe2edb?w=825", "alt_text": "SUTD Assistant Professor Soujanya Poria."}]}

The pits are sized just enough for the workers, often children, to descend using ropes or ladders to extract coal – often without proper safety measures and ventilation.\n\nAt least 15 miners were killed in one such “rat hole” mine in Meghalaya after being trapped for more than a month until January 2019 – one of the many tragedies in the state where rights group say 10,000 to 15,000 died in such mines between 2007 and 2014.\n\nThere are also environmental concerns as the process can lead to land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution.\n\nStill, many small mine owners continued to employ short people or children to illegally extract coal. At the time, the federal government did not interfere, given the state’s remote location and the low quality of its coal.\n\nUttarakhand Secretary and Nodal Officer for the Silkayara rescue operation Neeraj Khairwal had previously said the men brought in were not rat-hole miners but experts in the technique.\n\nDuring a media briefing, a member of the National Disaster Management Authority, Lt General (retired) Syed Ata Hasnain said: “Rat-hole mining may be illegal, but a rat-hole miner’s talent and experience is being used.\n\n“This is a special situation where we have to save lives.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nLike all migrant communities, the Malayalees who came to Singapore in the 19th and early 20th centuries were “regional” to begin with.\n\nHailing from India’s south-western coastal areas of Travancore, Cochin and Malabar, which later became the state of Kerala, with its famously high literacy rate, they set up libraries in various parts of the island where Malayalam speakers congregated.\n\nThese served as community clubs where the people of these areas could socialise as well as read and discuss the latest happenings in Singapore, India and the world.\n\n“The regional variations then fell away and gave way to an assimilated identity,” explained Dr Anitha Devi Pillai, a senior lecturer at the National Institute of Education, who has done more than two decades of research on the Malayalees in Singapore.\n\n“And, with the professionals coming in later, associations were started which helped maintain the identity of the Singapore Malayalees. Today, it is these associations and groups that are keeping the community and its unique customs and traditions together.”\n\nA Malayalee herself, Dr Anitha has used her wealth of knowledge about the community to curate the Indian Heritage Centre’s (IHC) special exhibition Ente Veedu, My Home: Malayalees in Singapore, which opened on Nov 25 and will continue till Sept 15 next year.\n\nIt focuses on the Malayalees’ journey, their ancestral roots, settlement and contributions to Singapore, and their evolving notions of home and identity.\n\n“It’s a diverse community with a rich tapestry of practices,” said IHC chairman Rajaram Ramasubban. “This exhibition gives an opportunity to highlight the special features of the community.\n\n“It is not about the history of Kerala, but how the Malayalees came from Kerala, made a living here and continue to keep their unique identity through their clothes, food, festivals and language.”\n\nThe Malayalee community, the second-largest within Singapore’s Indian population, has for centuries been a melting pot of cultures and faiths – Hindu, Muslim and Christian, among others.\n\nMalayalees began travelling to Singapore in the 19th century, seeking better job opportunities, and have played a vital role in the country’s development, with their contributions spanning sectors such as healthcare,  politics and law.\n\n“In this exhibition, we celebrate the invaluable contributions of the Malayalee community to the rich tapestry of Singapore’s history,” said IHC’s assistant curator Liviniyah P.\n\nThe exhibition features more than 200 artefacts from the National Collection, National Library Board, National Museum of Singapore and Singapore Press Holdings, as well as the Malayalee community. Some of these are on public display for the first time.\n\nThe first “zone” – From Kerala to Singapore – explores the origins and roots of the Singapore Malayalees through items from Kerala, such as the decorative elephant caparison, or nettipattam.\n\nThe second – Ente Singapore: My Singapore – uncovers the contributions of the Malayalees as they settled here, such as the spaces they lived and worked in, and the art forms and the language they brought with them. The third – In a Malayalee Home – celebrates the range of Malayalee customs and traditions, including the doorway of a Syrian Christian house.\n\nThe final zone – Malayalees in Singapore – chronicles the lives of Malayalee pioneers across the 19th and 20th centuries. A video installation, titled Being Malayalee: Voices of the Future, rounds up the exhibition.\n\nProduced in collaboration with the youth wings of the Singapore Malayalee Association, Singapore Kairalee Kala Nilayam, Sree Narayana Mission and Naval Base Kerala Library, it shares the thoughts of 10 Singaporean Malayalee youths about home, culture and identity.\n\n“It is through this exhibition that we can deepen our thinking to see how heritage is truly a unifying force,” said Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, while inaugurating the exhibition on Nov 24.\n\n“The community has led by example, and forged a uniquely Singaporean identity, bringing people of diverse backgrounds together with a strong sense of belonging to Singapore.”\n\nCulture chronicler Chen Bitian, who viewed the exhibition, said it leaves a profound impression: “As a Chinese, it provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the history and culture of the Malayalee community.\n\n“Singapore, being multiracial, has seamlessly accommodated every ethnic group, allowing each to carve out its unique space and sense of belonging, and from this many have found the meaning of home.”\n\nThe exhibition is open from 10am\n\nto 6pm, Tuesday to Sunday.\n\nAdmission is free for Singaporeans\n\nand Permanent Residents.\n\nMore information can be found at\n\nhttps://www.indianheritage.gov.sg/\n\nIt is through this exhibition that we can deepen our thinking to see how heritage is truly a unifying force.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, during the exhibition’s inauguration on Nov 24", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b71b51b1daf85e3bb266810b29dfa566347ce20c4cba929fda4ea66afc1193cb?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Muhammad Shafiq, a former Youth Wing President of the Singapore Malayalee Association, at the exhibition."}]}

I learnt so many new things.”\n\nSreeranjani also saw her classmates from the School of The Arts Laya Mahesh and Vedagnya Narasimha – both 16 – perform violin solos.\n\nThe violinists had to audition for a place in the show by submitting a video of their previous performances.

Roughly the size of an SUV, the satellite is set to be launched from India in the first quarter of next year, with a target launch set for January.\n\nNisar will map the entire planet once every 12 days, providing data for understanding changes in ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, groundwater and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides.\n\nIndia is aiming to increase its share of the global satellite launch market fivefold within the next decade, and agreed to join Nasa’s Artemis Accords in June this year.\n\nThe accords aim to clarify and modernise principles of the widely ratified 1967 Outer Space Treaty by urging scientific transparency and establishing rules of coordination to avoid harmful interference in space and on the moon.\n\nIndia in August won a race to reach the south pole of the moon against Russia after the latter’s Luna-25 lander crashed.\n\nWith Western sanctions over Russia’s war in Ukraine, Moscow might find it difficult to fund a successor.\n\nChina, which made the first soft landing on the far side of the moon in 2019, has more missions planned as well, having spent US$12 billion on its space programme in 2022, according to estimates.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, is on track to spend roughly US$93 billion on its Artemis moon programme through 2025.\n\n“This is the golden age of space exploration,” Mr Nelson said at the event.\n\nHe also addressed a group of students in Bengaluru, with special guest Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian to venture into space, also in attendance.\n\nThe gathering turned into a beacon of motivation as Mr Sharma shared his extraordinary journey. His narrative not only captivated the audience but also served as a testament to the boundless possibilities that space exploration holds for future generations.\n\nThe Nasa chief encouraged the youth, who are part of what he termed the “Artemis Generation,”  to work hard, dream big, and reach for the stars. “The universe is the limit,” he said.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8d38bcc01490d4c251f99eb0d5dfbc0117b9e2dac796125d9b02222bfad7b0d9?w=825", "alt_text": "NASA administrator Bill Nelson (right) with former Indian Astronaut Rakesh Sharma at the VITM Auditorium in Bengaluru on Nov 29, 2023."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAn Indian government official directed an unsuccessful plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist, who is also a United States citizen, on American soil, the US Justice Department said on Wednesday, in announcing charges against a man accused of orchestrating the attempted murder.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan said Nikhil Gupta, 52, worked with the Indian government employee, whose responsibilities included security and intelligence, on the plot to assassinate the New York City resident who advocated for a Sikh sovereign state in northern India.\n\nProsecutors did not name the Indian official or the target, although they did describe the latter as a US citizen of Indian origin.\n\nUS officials have named him as Mr Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual citizen of the US and Canada.\n\nGupta was arrested by Czech authorities in June and is awaiting extradition.\n\n“The defendant conspired from India to assassinate, right here in New York City, a US citizen of Indian origin who has publicly advocated for the establishment of a sovereign state for Sikhs,” the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan Damian Williams said.\n\nThe Indian official is described in the related indictment as a “Senior Field Officer” with responsibilities in “Security Management” and “Intelligence”, employed by the Indian government, who “directed the plot from India”.\n\nHe allegedly offered US$100,000 for a contract hit and asked Gupta to arrange it. He also provided Gupta with the target’s home address, phone numbers and details of his daily routine. The Indian government employee and Gupta allegedly spoke repeatedly and also met in New Delhi.\n\nThe charges come after a senior Biden administration official last week said US authorities had thwarted a plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the US and issued a warning to India over concerns New Delhi was involved.\n\nUS President Joe Biden instructed Central Intelligence Agency director Bill Burns to contact his Indian counterpart, then travel to India to deliver a message that “we will not tolerate such activities and that we expect those responsible to be held fully accountable,” a senior US official said.\n\nMr Biden also raised the issue with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the G20 summit, where he “emphasised the seriousness of this issue and the potential repercussions for our bilateral relationship were similar threats to persist,” the official said.\n\nThe issue is highly delicate for both India and the Biden administration as they try to build closer ties in the face of an ascendant China, perceived as a threat for both democracies.\n\nIndia’s foreign ministry said New Delhi would formally investigate the concerns aired by the US. “India takes such inputs seriously since they impinge on our national security interests as well,” the ministry said.\n\nMs Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, said: “We will continue to expect accountability from the government of India based on the results of their investigations.”\n\nNews of the incident comes two months after Canada said there were allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Vancouver, something India has rejected.\n\nAccording to US prosecutors, the Indian official recruited Gupta in May this year to orchestrate the assassination. Gupta had previously told the official he had been involved with trafficking drugs and weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nGupta then reached out to someone he believed was a criminal associate for help hiring a hitman, but that associate was actually a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) undercover agent, prosecutors said.\n\nThe day after Mr Nijjar was killed, Gupta wrote to the undercover DEA agent saying Mr Nijjar “was also the target” and “we have so many targets”, prosecutors said.\n\nGupta faces two counts of murder-for-hire and murder-for-hire conspiracy.\n\nThe Indian government has complained about the presence of Sikh separatist groups outside India, including in Canada and the US. The groups have kept alive the movement for Khalistan, or the demand for an independent Sikh state to be carved out of India.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/81f3389ca19959ea36f3881d4778d702a317b1cd44297c2cb57c41bb5ab5b03e?w=825", "alt_text": "An undercover US law enforcement officer is handed $15,000, described by the US Department of Justice as the advance cash payment, by an associate of Nikhil Gupta, who was charged with orchestrating the attempted murder of a Sikh separtist, in a car in the Manhattan borough of New York City."}]}

He had gone back to India to get married, before returning here for work.\n\nMs Meenambal’s two older brothers were already serving National Service on the way to getting Singapore citizenship when she arrived.\n\nNaturally, there was much for her to adjust to, language notwithstanding.\n\n“I was disappointed to learn that I had to start my education from Primary Three level – at 11 years old. It was a waste of two years for me,” said Ms Meenambal, now 51, who at the time enrolled at the now-defunct Beatty Primary School.\n\nAn educator for the last 18 years, Ms Meenambal continues to live in Singapore. But it was only recently that she began to forge a stronger bond with the people from her village – thanks to gatherings here organised for people from Melavasal.\n\nThrough word of mouth and by recognising her fellow villagers at family functions and temples, Ms Meenambal and her brothers connected with hundreds of people from Melavasal living here.\n\nThey meet on festive occasions, most notably to join hands and raise funds to help improve the living standards in their village.\n\nPeople from southern Indian regions around Tiruchirappalli city, such as Mannargudi, travelled to Singapore for work and business from the 1920s. They now make up a large proportion of the 500,000 Tamil-origin Singaporeans.\n\nSingapore’s influence is telling in and around the village. Indeed, there is so much admiration for Singapore’s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew that Mannargudi is said to be building a monument for him, The Times of India reported in May this year.\n\n“Melavasal was once a primitive village,” explained Ms Meenambal. “But it has vastly developed now with proper schools and facilities.\n\n“Before, schools were run down and people did not receive proper education to work and live there. That prompted the villagers to move overseas, and Singapore was their obvious choice.\n\n“Our village is in a reformed shape now because of our monetary contribution. And that speaks of how special our community is.”\n\nIn 2017, the community began to link up through chat groups on Whatsapp. They first organised a family event called Uravugal Ondrukoodal (meaning “relations unite” in Tamil) at Pasir Ris Park in 2019. There, families and friends – all with a common hometown bond – met for the first time.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic prevented further gatherings, until recently.\n\nOn Nov 19, some 130 people – young and old – gathered in Pasir Ris Park for a day of food and activities.\n\nGoodie bags labelled “Uravugal Ondrukoodal’” were given out to all. There were also prizes for those who won  games.\n\n“I know almost everyone from the group, and what came as a surprise to me was that some of the migrant workers who attended the gathering were actually sons of my former classmates in India,” said Ms Meenambal.\n\nAnnathurai Mithun, an eight-year-old pupil from New Town Primary School, said: “I am so happy that I made a huge number of friends through this gathering.

This year, the management committee decided to fly in the band from India as they wanted all the members to sit back, relax and enjoy the five-hour event.\n\n“The band appealed to us because they play music that is both traditional and modern, and liked by both the old and the young,” said MMM’s president Naveen Gadia. “They have done more than a hundred live performances.\n\n“Every member of my team worked tirelessly to produce a wonderful evening. The minister’s presence was a morale booster for us and added to our spirits.

Santosh Kumar\n\nRAVI SINGARAM\n\nThe Singapore Social Cricket League (SCL), organised twice a year, has again entered the Singapore Book of Records (SBR) for the Largest Cricket Tournament on the island with 102 teams, 753 matches and 3,000 clubs-registered players.\n\nIt surpassed its record of 94 teams, which was set in its first season this year.\n\nThe record was previously held by the Ceylon Sports Club, which organised a tournament in 2010 with 52 teams that lasted 72 hours – from 8pm on Sept 9 to 8pm on Sept 12.\n\nThe SCL tournament, which began on June 3 this year and concluded last weekend, saw winners in three divisions – Elite, Premier and Deluxe.\n\nAll matches were played with weighted red tennis balls across three pitches at Sengkang Cricket Ground.\n\nThe tournament’s volunteer team lead Shaji Philip recounted its humble beginnings in 2007 with just eight teams.\n\n“We started with a group of friends and volunteers and the tournament slowly grew to where it is now,” he said.\n\n“The tournament aims to provide affordable cricket for migrant workers, who form the bulk of the players, and alleviate their daily stress through sports, as most of them are in Singapore without their families.”\n\nNo fee is charged for participation.\n\nSBR President Ong Eng Huat admired the tournament’s concept.\n\n“It is marvellous that some Singaporean volunteers have initiated this out of concern for migrant workers. It is a big act of kindness,” he said.\n\nVolunteer Abdul Farhan, 37, who schedules the matches and ensures they are held properly, pointed out that the players too play a big role in the successful running of the tournament. “The players contribute by taking turns to do umpire duties,” he said.\n\nIn total, the tournament has six sub-leagues – Saturday Deluxe, Sunday Deluxe, Saturday Premier, Sunday Premier, Saturday Elite and Sunday Elite.\n\nEach sub-league comprises 17 teams with its own quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nEach team plays 14 games in the group stages, after which the top team books a direct spot in the semi-finals, while the next six battle in knockout matches for the last three semi-final spots.\n\nThe finals of all six sub-leagues took place last weekend, culminating in a mega final between the Saturday and Sunday champions from each division.\n\nEach match is usually 15 overs. But due to rain last Sunday afternoon, the mega final was reduced to three overs per innings.\n\nThe top seven teams from each sub-league were promoted to a higher division for the next tournament that begins in January.\n\nKamalabathan Manikandan, 36, captain of Survivors, said his team members were thrilled with their Sunday Deluxe triumph.\n\n“Most of our players were winning a championship for the first time,” he said. “They were making video calls to their family and friends in India to share their happiness.”\n\nSurvivors’ promotion to the Premier division was an extra cause for celebration.\n\nThis year’s tournament was also special for Joseph Alex, who led Avengers to the title in the Elite division. It was the 40-year-old’s last engagement with the league, as he is returning to India this year after 18 years in Singapore and 10 years playing in the tournament.\n\n“It was a dream farewell,” he said, as he thanked his teammates for an incredible tournament.\n\nAn operations manager at an engineering company, he formed the team with migrant workers employed by his firm and their friends. Their B team, Avengers Plus, were runners-up in the Saturday Deluxe league.\n\nN.A.S. Mohamed Abdul Kadir, 35, who has been playing in the SCL for the past 16 years, led SQ66, a young team of players aged between 15 and 23. They lost the Deluxe division semi-final by five runs in a tie-breaking super over.\n\n“Shaji chettan (“elder brother” in Malayalam) does a wonderful job in organising the tournament, and takes care of me like my own brother,” said Kadir.\n\nShaji himself played as a bowler for Team Kala, which reached the quarter-final of the Saturday Elite.\n\nHe said SCL will be organising a T20 tournament this month with 64 teams, before the next season starts in January.\n\n“We are aiming to bring the teams down to 96 so the scheduling would be easier,” he said. “We have also submitted an application to the Guinness Book of World Records for consideration as the “Largest Cricket Tournament at a Single Venue”.\n\nWe started with a group of friends and volunteers and the tournament grew to where it is now.\n\nSingapore Social Cricket League volunteer team lead Shaji Philip (above)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9d5c342b3986653fc221a6a73c3af4efbcac33fbf99a0c8993ff05ee902d6af1?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c235ccbbb5c4c635e8b19562cfb74c53f35ad0352946b1f3c148b25eb116bd6c?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9d5c342b3986653fc221a6a73c3af4efbcac33fbf99a0c8993ff05ee902d6af1?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c235ccbbb5c4c635e8b19562cfb74c53f35ad0352946b1f3c148b25eb116bd6c?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9d5c342b3986653fc221a6a73c3af4efbcac33fbf99a0c8993ff05ee902d6af1?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

When the bus captain reminded him about paying the fare, the older man allegedly yelled back: “So what? Call the police, you stupid man!”\n\nHe continued berating Mr Prasad, who all throughout, simply smiled and stayed calm, without replying. He then took out his own money and paid for the man’s fare.\n\nAfter a few stops, the elderly man pressed the bell to alight, but he could not stand up and shouted for help.\n\nMr Prasad jumped out from his driver’s seat, lifted the man up and guided him down from the bus. He made sure the man was fine before he drove off.\n\nThe story was relayed to online news site Stomp by a passenger, Ms Sharon, who had also highlighted another incident that involved herself and Mr Prasad from two years ago.\n\nThat time, she had boarded a service 852 bus without her wallet. Mr Prasad gave her $10, not just for her fare, but also in case she needed money for the rest of the day.\n\nLauding the bus captain for his compassion and extraordinary service, Sharon had said at the time: “This handsome driver never fails to smile and greet every passenger, young or old, regardless of race, rich or poor. It really makes my day.”\n\nSpeaking to tabla!

I also felt that the safety of the other passengers on board was very important and that made me stay calm.”\n\nThere are, of course, instances of kind passengers who, in recognising Mr Prasad’s efforts, buy him breakfast and fruits. “There was one time my passenger brought me mangoes from his trip to Thailand,” Mr Prasad said.\n\nThe bus captain, who has a seven-year-old daughter, left his job as an ambulance driver after just over a year to spend more time with his family.\n\nWhile he primarily operates bus service 852, which goes from Yishun to Bukit Batok, Mr Prasad also drives feeder services 803 and 805.\n\n“He never fails to smile and greet every passenger, young or old, regardless of race... it really makes my day.”\n\nBus passenger Sharon", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/42262afbe2128f7b66dcfdad0f6d345860f043fcb8c5d814864869a089e4715f?w=825", "alt_text": "SBS Transit bus captain Prasad Gnanapragasam."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Chennai city police have booked actor Mansoor Ali Khan for allegedly making derogatory remarks against actor Trisha Krishnan.\n\nNungambakkam Police booked the actor under Sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to outrage the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference about his role as a death row convict in the recent hit film Leo, Khan said: “When I heard that I was acting with Trisha, I thought there would be a bedroom scene in the film. I thought that I could carry her to the bedroom just like I did with other actresses in my earlier movies.\n\n“I have done so many rape scenes, and it’s not new to me. But these guys didn’t even show Trisha to me on the sets during the shooting in Kashmir.”\n\nKhan and Trisha played impactful roles in the film, but they did not share any screen time.\n\nIndia’s National Commission for Women (NCW) had asked the Tamil Nadu Director-General of Police to take action against the 61-year-old actor after his shocking remarks.\n\nSeveral Tamil industry heavyweights condemned Khan’s comments, with Trisha, in a note on X last Saturday, terming them “sexist, disrespectful, misogynistic, repulsive and in bad taste”.\n\nVowing to never work with him again, she said: “A recent video has come to my notice where Mr Mansoor Ali Khan has spoken about me in a vile and disgusting manner. I strongly condemn this. He can keep wishing, but I am grateful never to have shared screen space with someone as pathetic as him, and I will make sure it never happens for the rest of my film career as well. People like him bring a bad name to mankind.”\n\nLokesh Kanagaraj, who directed Leo, which also stars Thalapathy Vijay, said in support of Trisha: “Disheartened and enraged to hear the misogynistic comments made by Mr Mansoor Ali Khan, given that we all worked in the same team. Respect for women, fellow artists and professionals should be non-negotiable in any industry and I absolutely condemn this behaviour.”\n\nSouth Indian playback singer Chinmayi Sripaada said: “The thing about men like Mansoor Ali Khan, they have always been talking like this; never been condemned – with other men in power, money and influence laughing along.”\n\nFollowing the backlash, Khan issued a clarification, asserting his words were misrepresented and that he did not intend to offend or disrespect Trisha.\n\nHe urged his fans and the public not to misconstrue his statement while underscoring his enduring respect for his co-star.\n\n“My kids informed me that they had heard on the news that I had mistreated Trisha in the press meet. To be honest, I complimented her in the film. Trisha is treated similarly to how Hanuman moved the mountain (Sanjeevani). I made the comment in jest. Some have purposefully sliced it and presented it to Trisha in an alternative format,” Khan said in a statement.\n\n“I am not the kind of person who is afraid of all this fuss. Today, politicians in prominent positions are among the heroines who have collaborated with me.\n\n“My daughter Dil Rupa is a huge fan of yours. I also have two more daughters... Those who have acted with me know very well how I respect women. Some people have angered Trisha by misrepresenting this. There is much work to be done in the world. So focus on your work. Thank you!”\n\nCalling Khan’s statement “disgusting”, actress Malavika Mohanan said: “This is disgusting on so many levels. It’s shameful enough how this man views women and thinks about them, but then to (also) have the guts to speak about it openly and unapologetically, not even worried about repercussions?

Out of which 200, including The Wheel, were screened in Barcelona during the festival.\n\nThirty films were nominated for various awards and The Wheel made it to the final five in both the Best International Film Drama and Best Actor categories, before Gibu won the best actor award.\n\nThe jury praised the film for its visual symbolism, and the actor for effectively capturing the complexities of the protagonist.\n\n“It was a great honour to win the award, after all the effort I put in to portray a complicated character,” said Gibu, who hails from Thiruvalla in Kerala and moved to Singapore in 2008. “This recognition will motivate me to work even harder and perform better.”\n\nGibu, an IT engineer and senior project manager with a global technology and business solution provider, started his entertainment career as the host of Asianet TV show Singapore Choice.\n\nHe has since acted in four plays, nine short films and three feature films, including in English, Hindi, Malayalam and Tamil.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nAustralian Dene Border went to the Cricket World Cup final in Ahmedabad, India, with “low expectations”.\n\nThe currency trader, who lives in Singapore, is the son of Australian World Cup-winning captain Allan Border. The 39-year-old felt “India were too good throughout the tournament and we did not have much of a chance”.\n\nNaturally, the way the match turned out in Australia’s favour thrilled him.\n\n“From the decision to bowl first, to the bowling, fielding and batting, Australia were top class,” said Dene, who is also the cricket convenor at the Singapore Cricket Club (SCC). “India wilted under the pressure exerted on them.”\n\nThe decision to travel to Ahmedabad was made only on Nov 16, three days before the final. Dene went as part of a group of 20 mates from the SCC which included three other Australians.\n\n“We waited to see if Australia would beat South Africa in the semi-final, and then made all our bookings,” he said. “The flights and hotel accommodation were priced a bit high, but we got the corporate match tickets at face value.”\n\nHe felt “cool” walking into the 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium despite “eight out of ten spectators dressed in blue”.\n\n“There were several fans waving Indian flags and the noise was deafening. But I never felt intimidated,” he said.\n\n“I was nervous, but I stood up and clapped every run Australia scored. No one booed us. Some even congratulated us after we won. Everyone was so gracious.”\n\nThe only peculiarity that struck him was that the crowd went “dead quiet” every time Australia scored a boundary or a six.\n\n“This would never happen at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (which along with the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is considered among the biggest stadiums in the world),” he said. “People would clap when an opposition batter plays a good shot.”\n\nThe Modi Stadium, touted as the biggest cricket stadium in the world with a seating capacity of 130,000, appeared full. But the official figure was 92,453 for the night.\n\n“It was my first time attending a World Cup final, and the stadium was full of cricket enthusiasts,” said Dene. “But I have never seen such a partisan crowd. They went pin-drop silent every time Australia did well, and several of them walked out when it looked like we were winning the match.”\n\nDene has “no recollection” of the 1987 World Cup final at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, where his father lifted the trophy following Australia’s seven-run win over England.\n\n“I was only three then, and I don’t have much recollection of him as a cricketer,” he said.\n\n“My father, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, was very happy with Australia’s win on Sunday. He thought we would play conservatively. But he found Pat Cummins’ captaincy inspirational, and the team with the better composure won.”\n\nV.K.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nSingapore resident Prantik Mazumdar is despondent that India lost the cricket World Cup final to Australia in Ahmedabad last Sunday. But he is overjoyed he got to watch his favourite team six times at various match venues along with his wife and son over the tournament’s 45 days.\n\nThat included the final, the mega India-Pakistan clash in Ahmedabad, India’s six-wicket league-stage win over Australia in Chennai, and the hosts’ mammoth 243-run win over semi-finalists South Africa at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\n“Australia played exceptional cricket in the final,” said the 40-year-old. “They showed us how to play and win in a mammoth stadium packed with jingoistic fans. It is their best World Cup win out of six simply because they beat a strong Indian side, which was bowling exceptionally well, in India no less.\n\n“As a fan, I loved the whole party atmosphere in Ahmedabad. But the crowd was very partisan, which didn’t leave a good taste. It would have been great if they had also cheered for Australia and Pakistan and the other teams who played there.”\n\nPrantik, a cricketer in the local league who has captained the Singapore Indian Association and National University of Singapore teams, has been hooked on watching World Cup matches since the 2011 tournament in India. He was at the final that year, and also at the 2015 and 2019 World Cup finals.\n\n“I’ve been a cricket fan for years and I had a fabulous time travelling around India in 2011,” said Prantik, who is managing director at Japanese international advertising and public relations company Dentsu. “This time I wanted to do a World Cup tour with my family.\n\n“My wife (Dipti, 33) follows cricket passionately, while my son (Ayaan, 7) has begun to play the sport seriously. So, I thought why not take them along.\n\n“(The trip) did not cost us much as we took Indigo flights throughout, and friends and family members provided us with tickets and accommodation.\n\n“Two of the games were in Pune and Bengaluru where our parents live, so we also got to celebrate Durga Puja and Deepavali with them.”\n\nThe family also bumped into several friends from Singapore during the matches, especially the final.\n\n“In Indian grounds, it is very hard to coordinate and meet for a beer as there are different sections, and it is difficult to move around,” said Prantik. “That’s not the case in Australia or England where it’s more like a picnic. But, outside the stadiums in India, there are great places to have thosai and tea by the roadside or nice meals at restaurants.”\n\nWhile they found the match experiences entertaining, the family weren’t comfortable with fans booing and jeering when India were losing, Prantik said.\n\n“Another problem was that few tickets were released to foreign fans, with the bulk of the tickets sold either on the black market or for corporate favours. So, each match had only about 5 to 10 per cent of fans from other countries, especially the high profile India-Pakistan game.\n\n“This is not ideal; in Manchester, during the 2019 World Cup, the beauty was sitting with Pakistanis and others and enjoying the match. Whether your team wins or loses, it’s all about the competitive spirit.”\n\nTo Ayaan, watching the World Cup matches was a dream come true. “My favourite player is Virat Kohli, and I was excited to watch him score two centuries,” the boy said. “I also enjoyed recording videos with my father before and after each match.”\n\nDipti said it was a “surreal experience” to watch Team India live at so many matches and to “cheer hard, dance, sing and #bleedblue”.\n\n“While the final didn’t go our way, we’re very proud that Team India remained unbeaten until the last game. It was sheer joy to watch our team display outstanding skill and camaraderie on the field,” she added.\n\nPrantik felt India had an exceptional campaign but missed a trick or two in the final.\n\n“We missed all-rounder Hardik Pandya (through injury), as statistics show that every time we don’t have an insurance batter, the top and middle order strike rate goes down.\n\n“With three lefties in the Australian batting line-up, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin too would have been handy.\n\n“Also, the organisers and fans perhaps put too much pressure on the Indian players to deliver the cup. Home advantage then actually became a disadvantage, as Australia had nothing to lose. The final was turned into a coronation ceremony, and the Indian players caved under the pressure.”\n\n(One) problem was that few tickets were released to foreign fans, with the bulk sold either on the black market or for corporate favours.\n\nSingapore resident Prantik Mazumdar", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8d8e70d794bb833bd86de14384dc9c48a90afad0741e055620e6cda11646783b?w=825", "alt_text": "Parntik Mazumdar with his wife Dipti Kamath and son Ayaan at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad for the World cup final."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMs Budhni Manjhiyain, 80, the woman who was ostracised by her Santhali tribal community and forced to flee her village after exchanging garlands with then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959, was content and had no complaints in the days leading up to her death on Nov 17, according to her grandson.\n\n“What happened to my grandmother was very wrong, but I have let it go,” 43-year-old Baapi Dutta told The Indian Express. “During her last moments, she did not complain and was at peace when she passed away.”\n\nMs Budhni was just 16 when she exchanged garlands with Pandit Nehru on Dec 6, 1959, when he had visited Dhanbad district, then a part of Bihar, for the inauguration of the Panchet Dam.\n\nMr Nehru had insisted that a woman working on the project be a part of the inauguration, and the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) selected Ms Budhni, along with Mr Ravan Manjhi, a Santhali man, to welcome the prime minister.\n\nHowever, what happened next altered the course of Ms Budhni’s life.\n\nIn reciprocation of Ms Budhni garlanding him, Mr Nehru garlanded her. He also insisted that she press the button at the power station to signal the start of operations. Mr Nehru also stood close to Ms Budhni, which offended the tribal community.\n\nWhen she returned to her village, Karbala, now a submerged area in Jharkhand, after all the fanfare, the elders told her that by garlanding the PM at the function she had, in effect, married him.\n\nFurthermore, since Mr Nehru was not a Santhal, she was no longer a part of the community and was told to leave the village.\n\nLeft with no option, Ms Budhni left her home and took shelter in Panchet with the help of a DVC colleague Sudhir Dutta.\n\nIn 1962, Ms Budhni left her job at the DVC and moved to Saltod in West Bengal’s Purulia district. There, she took up work as a daily wager.\n\nMedia reports said she later married Mr Dutta and the two had a daughter, Ratna Dutta.\n\nIn a recent interview with a local news channel, Ms Budhni said: “What happened? Nothing. Nehru came, we exchanged garlands, and he left… I was later called the ‘tribal wife’ of Nehru. I had to flee for my own sake.”\n\nMr Baapi Dutta, who works as an assistant clerk at DVC, said: “My grandmother fled for her life, as she could have been killed for ‘marrying’ Nehru. Those days, the old people of the village had some outdated practices, and she was a victim of that. She fled to the Saltod area and worked in a government-operated coal mine.\n\n“The Central government had received a lot of criticism for the treatment meted out to my grandmother. During a visit to West Bengal, a local legislator told then-PM Rajiv Gandhi about her ordeal. This later led to her getting a job at the DVC around 1985-86 as a contract labourer.”\n\nMs Budhni retired from the DVC in 2005, and later, at her insistence, Mr Baapi Dutta got a job there.\n\nFollowing her retirement, Ms Budhni lived a quiet life and died on Nov 17 following a prolonged illness.\n\nThousands, including local politicians and officials, attended her funeral.\n\nAccording to The Times Of India, there are now calls for a monument built in her honour and for pension to be provided to her daughter Ratna, now 60.\n\nLocal leader Bhairab Mondal told The Indian Express: “She was a fighter her whole life. We will demand a memorial for her.”\n\nThe deputy chief engineer of DVC at Panchet, Mr Sumesh Kumar, told The Times Of India that no decision has been taken on the memorial yet. “These decisions can be taken only after consulting top officers,” he said.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“What happened?

The girl often skipped school just to see to the mother’s needs, Ms Verma said.\n\n“Her mother was very fearful of others, and she had isolated herself and her daughter. When we first saw them, the house smelled of urine, there was barely any food, and medicine was scattered everywhere.”\n\nMs Verma and her colleagues persuaded the girl’s relatives to look after her, and persuaded the mother to receive treatment in hospital.\n\nAlthough the mother died after a few months, Ms Verma said she was impressed by the resilience of the girl, who now lives with her relatives and attends school regularly.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6db92dc10bf961b3684f57d10e924847f3d0f78824dcb6e9ab833b064d15c714?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Nisha Sanjay Verma receiving the Outstanding Social Worker award  from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam."}]}

Patrons simply have to visit a participating restaurant and submit their most enticing food photos for a chance to win daily prizes.\n\nOrganisers have also announced an attempt during the festival to enter the record books by flipping the largest roti prata – an activity open to the public.\n\nUnder the unifying theme of “Every Spice Has a Story,” the festival not only seeks to celebrate the myriad flavours of India but also to remind the younger generation of various forgotten foods and activities prevalent in past decades but not so much today.\n\nThe event will showcase food items such as kacang puteh and potong ice cream in a “vanishing food trail” segment.\n\nMr S. Mahenthiran, honorary secretary of the Indian Restaurants Association (Singapore) and an organiser of the festival, said one of the key purposes of the festival was to create a nostalgic feeling among the older generation.\n\n“We don’t get to see some of these things any more today; the parrot fortune-teller outside Komala Vilas in Serangoon Road or the kacang puteh seller in Selegie – we don’t see these any more,” said the 34-year-old.\n\n“So we wanted to bring back this nostalgia and also educate the younger generation about how things were before in Singapore.”\n\nMr Mahenthiran spoke of some of the struggles that the food and beverage industry has experienced recently, most notably in the form of a labour crunch.\n\nThe issue has since been resolved by a new Ministry of Manpower policy  that was rolled out in September, allowing more leeway in issuing work permits for certain jobs in the sector.\n\n“Many restaurants – especially the Indian eateries – were going through a labour issue. Before the new policy came into effect, it was difficult to carry out events,” he said.\n\n“I knew of caterers actually turning down wedding events because they were not able to keep up with orders (due to the lack of manpower).\n\n“So, in a way, this food festival is a dedication to the new policy – it allows us to continue to showcase, preserve and celebrate our heritage and authentic Indian cuisine.”\n\nFor more information, visit\n\nwww.greatindianfoodfestival.com\n\nAli Kasim", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/makan-and-fun-at-indian-food-festival-1857879?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRescuers in Uttarakhand were drilling through debris yesterday to reach 41 men trapped in a highway tunnel in the Himalayan region after removing a metal obstruction that slowed progress overnight, a top official said.\n\nThe men have been stuck in the 4.5km tunnel for 11 days since it caved in on Nov 12. They are safe, authorities have said, with access to light, oxygen, food, water and medicines.\n\nRescuers had expected to break through early yesterday as only the last third of the debris blocking the tunnel remained to be drilled through, before an evacuation pipe could be pushed in and the men pulled to safety.\n\nBut they encountered a steel lattice girder arch after covering 45 metres of the estimated 60-metre stretch of debris, which required about six hours to cut and remove, said the official, Mr Bhaskar Khulbe.\n\n“Our calculation as of now is roughly 14 to 15 hours, unless something else happens, and we hope we will be able to do that,” Mr Khulbe, who works on the tunnel project, said yesterday evening (Singapore time).\n\n“It is difficult to anticipate what more hurdles we might face,” he said, adding that since the structure was not one of very hard rock, no major problem was expected, apart from another metal obstacle or rock.\n\nOnce the drilling is completed, officials plan to send rescuers through the evacuation pipe with stretchers on wheels to bring out the trapped men, they said.\n\nRescuers were hoping for a breakthrough this morning (Singapore time), although the government has also repeatedly warned any timelines were “subject to change due to technical glitches, the challenging Himalayan terrain, and unforeseen emergencies”.\n\nInside the Silkyara tunnel entrance, an AFP journalist said the site was a flurry of activity.\n\nWorried relatives gathered outside the site, where a Hindu shrine has been erected, with a priest holding prayers for the safe rescue of the trapped men.\n\n“The day they will come out of the tunnel, it will be the biggest, happiest day for us,” said Mr Chanchal Singh Bisht, 35, whose 24-year-old cousin Pushkar Singh Ary is trapped inside.\n\nUttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the work was on a “war footing”.\n\nAuthorities have not said what caused the tunnel collapse, but the region is prone to landslides, earthquakes and floods.\n\nThe collapsed tunnel is located on the Char Dham pilgrimage route, one of the most ambitious projects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.\n\nIt aims to link four important Hindu pilgrimage sites with 890km of roads being built at a cost of US$1.5 billion.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government said the National Highways Authority of India would do a safety audit of 29 tunnels it is building following the collapse.\n\nReuters, AFP\n\nIt is difficult to anticipate what more hurdles we might face.\n\nMr Bhaskar Khulbe, an official who works on the tunnel project.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/680f8a07ebb82a21606c772996801acf4e1bdca2c9fc82248b3deac1c7657fd7?w=825", "alt_text": "An ambulance arrives at the tunnel where workers are trapped after  it collapsed in Uttarkashi, in Uttarakhand state."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Rail Corridor, a pleasant 24km hiking and cycling trail from Tanjong Pagar in the south to Kranji in the north, has some parts that are more appealing than others.\n\nMy favourite is the route from Buona Vista to the Rail Mall at Upper Bukit Timah Road.\n\nHop onto the trail near Buona Vista MRT Station and you can take in the luxuriant scenery and interesting historical structures.\n\nWithin minutes, the sounds of traffic are subdued. What rings loud and clear are bird calls and the chirping of insects.\n\nAs it was, up to 2011, a railway track to ferry passengers and freight between Singapore and Malaysia, the Rail Corridor offers greater visibility than a jungle hike. You can see more of the surrounding greenery and brightly coloured birds and butterflies fluttering above.\n\nA highlight of this route is the Old Bukit Timah Railway Station, which officially marks the end of the Southern Section and the start of the Central Section of the Rail Corridor.\n\nIn the mid-1900s, this station served to transport not just people but race horses because of its proximity to the then Bukit Timah Turf Club.\n\nIt was reopened in 2022 after major restoration, and many of its original features are now on display. These include track-switching levers and a tiny ticket window. There is a cafe at the former staff quarters – a popular stopping point that can get rather crowded on weekends.\n\nOnwards you go and a short while later, you will come across the steel truss bridge spanning Bukit Timah Road.

Santosh Kumar\n\nOn the outside, the Bendemeer flat belonging to Mr Ponnosamy Kalastree has the typical South Indian doorstep – a string of mango leaves suspended over the door, Deepavali bunting trailing down the doorway and the floor decorated with a colourful kolam.\n\nBut the flat’s interior is not typical of a South Indian home. Mr Ponnosamy, 76, decorates his unit with Chinese paintings, Peranakan pottery and Islamic art. Matriarchs in kebaya sit on distinctively Peranakan chairs, the intricately-carved coffee table topped with a glass panel.\n\nMalay kuehs such as koswee, lapis, putri salat and dadar are laid out in front of the guests. On the dining table were bowls filled with delectable dishes such as mutton rendang, prawn sambal and roti jala.\n\nTo Mr Ponnosamy, his home encapsulates the different cultures of Singapore, a mishmash just like Chitty Melaka.\n\nThe Chitty Melaka people, or Chettis, are descendants of South Indian merchants who first settled in Melaka around the 15th century and married women of Malay or Chinese descent. The Indian Heritage Centre estimates the number of Chettis in Singapore to be about 5,000.\n\n“The Chitty Melaka community where I am from enjoys the best of Indian, Chinese and Malay cultures. In a way, we represent the whole of Singapore,” said the security business consultant, whose ancestors left Melaka for Singapore in the 19th century and settled in Upper Serangoon Road.\n\nDressed in a sarong, kurta top and topi, Mr Ponnosamy speaks fluent English and Malay, with a smattering of Tamil.\n\nHis cousins Merlin Pillay, 70, and Jaya Lakshini Gurusamy, 73, are more fluent in Tamil. “I speak English with my father and Tamil with my mother. They speak Malay to each other,” said Ms Jaya.\n\nLeading up to Deepavali, the Chettis mark Naik Bukit, a tombstone sweeping festival derived from the Chinese Qing Ming tradition.\n\nTraditionally, the Chettis are Hindus belonging to the Shaiva denomination. They celebrate Deepavali and Pongal. Unlike most Hindus though, the Chitty Melaka people traditionally bury their dead.\n\nSimilar to ethnic Malayan-Singaporean South Indians, the Chettis make food offerings for their dead in a ritual called Bhogi Parachu, typically serving nasi lemak with eight to 11 side dishes.\n\nThe Chettis also have a more varied wardrobe. The women wear kebayas as often as they wear saris.\n\n“My husband is an Indian from outside our community. When I visit my mother-in-law, I wear a sari. When I visit members of my own community, I wear a kebaya,” said Ms Pillay.\n\nMs Dora Woo, who has been married to Mr Ponnosamy for 50 years and wears a pottu (or bindi) on her forehead, described the Chitty Melaka culture as “rich and interesting”.\n\nBut the Hindu faith remains a cornerstone of the community’s identity, explained Ms Merlin. She recalled how in her village of Gajah Berang, everyone would await the arrival of the deity procession during the Datuk Chachar festival every May.\n\nMr Ponnosamy, who is fluent in Malay and even won the top prize for a nationwide Malay oratorical competition, wishes he spoke more Tamil. He uses words such as sambar, murungai keerai (moringa leaves) and karuvadu (salted fish) when talking about food in Malay Chetti creole.\n\nThe Chitty Melaka Association, which Mr Ponnosamy presides over, will be releasing a cookbook, The Heritage Food Of The Peranakan Indians, on Nov 19.\n\nMs Merlin believes the elders in the community ought to speak more Tamil to their children. “Regardless of our fluency in Tamil, we are very much rooted in our Indian identity,” she explained.\n\n“It is inevitable that communities here absorb one another’s cultures. This is where we want to promote our culture as truly Singaporean, with a Singaporean identity,” said Mr Ponnosamy, who feels that greater awareness of his community would add more colour to the Singapore brand.\n\n“The Chitty Melaka community where I am from enjoys the best of Indian, Chinese and Malay cultures. In a way, we represent the whole of Singapore.”\n\nMr Ponnosamy Kalastree", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d725c25031188f9a68d7c65cf0cc9bb35e4176318e79c452e10902ee67c96515?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Ponnosamy Kalastree, sitting at the head of the dining table, hosting a Deepavali meal for his Chitty Melaka family."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhenever director Atlee releases a film, he gets called out for being unoriginal.\n\nThis criticism has been levelled against him since his debut Tamil film Raja Rani (2013), which some called a modern rehash of Mani Ratnam’s classic Mouna Ragam (1986).\n\nHis second film, Theri (2016), was considered similar to the Rajinikanth 1995 blockbuster Baashha, as well as other films.\n\nMersal (2017) and Bigil (2019) also faced similar complaints.\n\nRecently, Jawan, one of the biggest hits of 2023, starring Shah Rukh Khan in a double role, was trolled for being a mixture of Tamil films such as Thaai Naadu (1989), Anniyan (2005), Oru Kaidhiyin Diary (1985), and Ramana (2002).\n\nIn a recent interview with a YouTube channel, Atlee, whose original name is Arun Kumar, addressed the accusations.\n\nSaid the 40-year-old: “In the creative field, you end up making similar stories. That doesn’t mean I copy it; it can be inspired by (other movies).\n\n“I was inspired by MGR songs and that’s why I make intro songs. I take risks.\n\n“Do you think only I face such criticism in the world of cinema? Many great filmmakers and creative minds have faced it.”\n\nHe added: “When I did Raja Rani (2013), I wanted to do something about the increasing number of shattered families. But there was already a milestone film (Mouna Ragam) on the topic. At one point, I considered doing a film that was even a bit similar to others. But really, there’s not a single story that hasn’t been done before. I sit and genuinely work on my scripts.”\n\nAtlee pointed out that the criticism he receives is from those who want to bring him down.\n\n“When someone passes a (flippant) comment about my films being similar to others, I never think my effort, honesty and labour are mere replicas. It’s their opinion.\n\n“Of course, I have made films which have shared storylines with other films. For example, Theri has different versions before and after its release. But when I do it, it’s ‘copied’. Copying is easy. If that’s the case, everyone can do it.”\n\nAtlee also confirmed that he is working on a script where both Shah Rukh Khan and Thalapathy Vijay can share the screen.\n\nThe director said he was on a break from work to spend some time with his wife, Priya, and son, Meer.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/357b7563c8643631314b5327e2df030095094ea7944ed9c9c9d374f006f9b593?w=825", "alt_text": "Atlee with Shah Rukh Khan."}]}

That’s just not my style.”\n\nHis wife, a nurse for 40 years, had been a great source of support to him over the years, before she died of cancer in 2015.\n\n“In 2021, my mother also passed away,” said Mr Mohan. “If they had all been around now, my Deepavali would have been even more special.”\n\nHe is hesitant to get a guide dog as he is worried about the maintenance.\n\n“A big dog is not the same as a Maltese,” he said, referring to his pet Maltese dog that died in 2013.\n\nSo, he gets around with his cane and memory of streets.\n\nThese days, Mr Mohan is always on the lookout for opportunities to meet new people. He frequently takes part in SAVH programmes to keep himself upbeat.\n\nHis future Deepavali wishes include going on a cruise or a trip to Malaysia, and attending karaoke sessions and concerts.\n\n“What we have today may not be there tomorrow, so we must maximise the joy we can give others and think positively.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/42082eb619cae75c876f2094dee3ae842eda28dac9774ff50f10089c98e922d7?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Mohan Narayanasamy giving murukku to his barber friend Arend Seah during Deepavali."}]}

Later, he realises it’s something North Indians celebrate, a festival called Karva Chauth, celebrated by Hindu women in Northern and Western India where they observe a fast from sunrise to moonrise for the safety and longevity of their husbands.”\n\nThis is not the first time Channa and Kumar are collaborating.\n\nKalaa Utsavam producer David Pandarakannu said the idea to pair the two came after he saw 2018’s one-woman play Disco Sheela And Other Indian Superwomen, in which Channa was directed by Kumar.\n\nThat show convinced him that the two were “a perfect match”.\n\n“I have known Kumar for nine years, and we are good friends,” said Sharul. “He directed me in Disco Sheila, where I did five character monologues. So, it is only apt that I am scripting for him this time.”\n\nThe Esplanade believes that having Kumar at the festival will also attract people from outside the Indian community.\n\n“He has that reach and the content is crafted in a way that is informative,” said Pandarakannu.\n\nKumar believes his show will educate other communities like the Chinese and Malays about Indian customs and behaviour.\n\n“There will be a lot of relatable stuff which the audience will understand,” he said. “Come with an open mind, be happy and enjoy a good laugh.\n\n“If people get offended, it’s their problem.”\n\nSharul said the show is a bit risque, but they are aware of the sensitivities. “We haven’t overstepped the line,” she said.\n\n“Anyway, Kumar is well respected. (To some degree) he has the liberty to say anything, and people will accept it without complaining.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c38d3ad16f9092431dae4a018c62917367756081096640f5bb180618d8d50dc0?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRAVI SINGARAM\n\nThrongs of Indian supporters crowded bars, clubs and restaurants across Singapore to watch and enjoy the high-octane India versus New Zealand cricket World Cup semi-final on Tuesday.\n\nAmong them were a few Kiwis and neutral fans as well.\n\nThe Boat Quay area saw several of them queue up to find places to watch the engrossing encounter, which began at 4.30pm.\n\nMany office-goers had already booked places, and rushed to the venues after 6pm to catch the action.\n\nThere were women fans such as Jayalakshmi Srinivasan and Jyoti Ahuja who said “cricket is in our genes and we never miss an India match”.\n\nCrowds spilled over onto the streets along Circular Road as India’s batters made a bright start, with captain Rohit Sharma hitting a quick-fire 47, Shubman Gill 80 not out, Virat Kohli 117 and Shreyas Iyer 105 in their 397 for 4 in 50 overs.\n\nThe Indian fans at The Mask, Foodcoholic and Harry’s went crazy when Rohit hit a flurry of sixes.\n\nThen, as Kohli and Shreyas notched up thrilling centuries, the crowds became raucous with cheers and applause.\n\nAll were on their feet, chanting “Kohli! Kohli!”, dancing and rhythmically banging tables, when the Indian cricket icon scored his 50th one-day international hundred to break compatriot Sachin Tendulkar’s record.\n\nLocal league player Jayesh Salgaonkar, who took a half-day’s leave from work and was at Harry’s Boat Quay, was elated after Kohli’s achievement.\n\n“Each and every shot of his was thoroughly enjoyed,” he said.\n\nThe Indian fans’ confidence that their teams would win grew when New Zealand lost their first two wickets cheaply.\n\nBut they fell into despondency when New Zealand captain Kane Williamson and batter Daryl Mitchell steadied the innings and began to smash boundaries and sixes.\n\nThis spurred on the four New Zealand diehards at The Mask who began to shout “Kiwi! Kiwi!”.\n\nThe Indian crowds also became distraught when Mohammad Shami dropped Williamson at a crucial juncture.\n\nBut their worries turned into joy when Shami then scythed through the New Zealand batting line-up to give India a 70-run win.\n\n“We were here to enjoy the match and be with India while being far away from home,” said Mr Ramakrishnan, who moved to Singapore two months ago. “We are elated that India broke so many records today. I think India are in their best form and will win the World Cup.”\n\nIndia will take on either Australia or South Africa, who were playing in the second semi-final at press time yesterday, in Sunday’s final in Ahmedabad.\n\n“The kind of maturity that the Indian team displayed in the semi-final is very appreciable,” said Mr Kiran Kumar Bontha, 38, at Harry’s. “They were very clear about their approach and had good energy.\n\n“Whether we face Australia or South Africa, we will win the World Cup.”\n\nAnother India fan Puneet Singh said: “We have never seen such domination from an Indian side in all these years. We want Australia in the final so that we can beat them and avenge their years of domination.”\n\nWith India in the final, restaurants and bars here can expect bigger crowds on Sunday.\n\n“We have got to come back to Harry’s for the final and will want the same seats as they brought India luck against New Zealand,” said Nikhil Gujral.\n\nMs Manisha Kishore, managing director of Awadh restaurant at Centrepoint, said: “We have already received 60 lunch reservations for the finals, and we expect the fans to stay till the end of the match.”\n\nThe eatery has been screening the World Cup matches on an 80-inch TV with studio surround system.\n\nFans at The Mask Restaurant and Bar in Circular Road celebrating after India beat New Zealand in the Cricket World Cup.\n\nPHOTO: TAMIL MURASU\n\n“We have got to come back to Harry’s for the final and will want the same seats, as they brought India luck.”\n\nIndian fan Nikhil Gujral", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/assets/tabla_default-BKiwXiwe.webp?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/assets/tabla_default-BKiwXiwe.webp?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/assets/tabla_default-BKiwXiwe.webp?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/assets/tabla_default-BKiwXiwe.webp?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/assets/tabla_default-BKiwXiwe.webp?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nJasprit Bumrah was shocked. He covered his mouth and eyes with both hands.\n\nThe Indian fast bowler’s expression mirrored that of 33,000 fans at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Wednesday. Millions of others watching at home too were in disbelief: Had bowler Mohammed Shami just dropped the World Cup?\n\nIndia had totalled 397 for 4 in their 50 overs against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final. But had begun to stutter after Shami required only 10 balls to remove both the openers.\n\nNew Zealand captain Kane Williamson and No. 3 Daryl Mitchell then put up a 141-run partnership that threatened India’s progress to the final.\n\nIn a desperate step, India’s captain Rohit Sharma brought Bumrah back for his second spell, after the sold-out crowd had hardly made a squeak for 90 minutes.\n\nFive balls later, Bumrah drew a mistake from Williamson, who pulled hard but did not connect properly. The ball went straight to Shami, who fumbled and dropped the simple catch. The crowd went silent.\n\n“I felt terrible,” Shami said later.\n\nThe seam bowler had three overs to dwell on his mistake. He then returned to bowl, with New Zealand needing 179 more off 18 overs.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Shami then became the match winner. In three balls, he turned 220 for 2 into 220 for 4 by removing Williamson and then Tom Latham. He returned at the death to put the final touches on India’s win by dismissing Mitchell, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson.\n\nNew Zealand were bowled out for 327 in 48.5 overs, and Shami finished with seven wickets, the first time an Indian bowler had achieved that feat in a men’s one-day international.\n\nIt was a terrific performance from the 33-year-old, who was the victim of Islamophobic online abuse during the T20 World Cup two years ago, following his expensive spells and dropped catches.\n\nA month ago, Shami wasn’t even in the India team, squeezed out in pursuit of balance. Yesterday, he travelled to Ahmedabad for the final as the leading wicket-taker of this World Cup, with 23 in six games.\n\nAnother performance like this one, against Australia or South Africa who were playing in the second semi-final yesterday, and he may well bring India’s decade-long wait for a major trophy to an end.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e0106540692e7178da9f4a9dee8248ab9b9f9fcd517c890693b2cb2ca20c435b?w=825", "alt_text": "Mohammed Shami being lifted by India’s captain Rohit Sharma after taking the wicket of New Zealand’s Lockie Ferguson to win the match and advance to the final,"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhen the list of Asian Academy Creative Awards (AAAs) national winners were being announced online, actor Shrey Bargava, who had tuned in with his mother, did not think he stood a chance against the big performers in the fray.\n\nThat was why he was in disbelief when his name was announced as Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Singapore.\n\n“I was in a state of shock,” said the 28-year-old.\n\n“My mother cried. My dad rushed out from a work meeting, and we all hugged.\n\n“It was my first national award for acting, and it hit me just how big these awards are. Undoubtedly, it was the highest honour I have received in my acting career.”\n\nThe Singaporean won the award for his role of Vijay Kapoor in Titoudao: Dawn Of A New Stage, the second season of the highly rated English drama series Titoudao: Inspired By The True Story Of A Wayang Star, produced by Oak3 Films and Mediacorp.\n\nOpen to the Asia-Pacific region, AAA honours excellence across television, film, digital, streaming and emerging technologies. The national winners were announced on Sept 28.\n\n“All my life, it has been a dream to make Singapore proud through my hard work and acting,” said Shrey. “I trained in Los Angeles with the hope that one day I could help shine some light on our local talents and industry.”\n\nArtistes Shrey has worked with felt that he deserved the award because he was a hit as Vijay, providing much of the comic relief in the heartfelt drama.\n\n“Shrey is one of the most diligent, sincere and intuitive artistes I have worked with,” said actor-singer-host Ebi Shankara. “His love for his craft shows in his practice. This recognition is truly deserving.”\n\nActress-director-producer Daisy Irani said: “In our shows together, I always play Shrey’s mother and he helps create such an amazing relationship that I don’t feel like I’m acting. Shrey is a committed and passionate actor. He makes us all proud. I’m just so happy that his talent has been recognised.”\n\nShrey, a BA merit scholar and graduate from the University of Southern California in acting and cinema and media studies, has played prominent roles in plays and TV serials in recent years.\n\nHe featured as the witty 1940s lawyer George Singam in This Land Is Mine (2021), the foolish but sincere businessman Rajan Verma in My Lockdown Wedding (2021) and the unhinged tech-genius-turned-terrorist Rajeev Khanna in Third Rail (2022).\n\n“Acting, for me, is a constant journey of growth,” said the actor-host who was born in Lucknow, India, and moved to Singapore with his parents when he was a baby.\n\n“With every project, I find myself evolving and expanding my range.”\n\nSince he speaks English and Hindi, Shrey has starred in English-language productions and shows, including hosting the 2015 Singapore SEA Games and the 2015 National Day Celebration Concert at the Floating Platform. He has also performed in a range of theatre genres – including drama, comedy, romance, thriller and horror.\n\n“I have been on stage since I was a child. Taking words from a page and breathing life into them with my heart, mind and soul, is a profound experience,” he said.\n\n“Over the years, roles for ethnic minorities have grown to become more substantial and better written. I have worked hard to better myself as an actor and let my work speak for itself.”\n\nAt the Dec 7 AAA Grand Awards and Gala Final, which will be held at Chijmes, Shrey will be going up against actors such as Hong Kong’s Lam Tsz-sin (The Invisibles), India’s Prosenjit Chatterjee (Jubilee), Indonesia’s Teuku Rifnu Wikana (96 Jam), South Korea’s Jo Woo-jin (Narco-Saints), Malaysia’s Syafie Naswip (Nenek Bongkok Tiga), Philippines’ Mon Confiado (A Silent Night), Taiwan’s Wu Kun-da (On Our Way) and Thailand’s Sadanont Durongkavarojana (Get Rich).\n\nOak 3 Films’ executive producer Lim Suat Yen believes Shrey can go all the way. “Shrey is a natural-born talent. He can connect to audiences with his convincing emotions.”\n\nActor-host Noah Yap said: “Shrey is one of the most talented and versatile actors I have known, who always gives his 100 per cent in any role he plays. He never fails to impress. A truly gifted actor.”\n\n“All my life, it has been a dream to make Singapore proud through my hard work and acting.”\n\nActor Shrey Bargava", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ccfc820341501721d68201cf9b7bd0376b2bac8ec544a81c580683099167adeb?w=825", "alt_text": "Actor Shrey Bhargava."}]}

Jaishankar.\n\nREUTERS\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nIndia’s diplomacy is being put to the test after Qatar meted out the death sentence to eight Indians, all former naval personnel.\n\nThe eight were detained in Doha in August 2022, reportedly on suspicion of espionage. On Oct 30 this year, a Qatari court sentenced them to death – a decision India’s government described as a shock.\n\nThe exact grounds on which the men were arrested and the charges on which they were convicted have not been disclosed, reported BBC.\n\nIt is speculated that they are accused of spying for Israel. They had been working in a personal capacity for Dahra, an Omani private defence company, to help oversee the introduction of Italian U212 stealth submarines into the Qatari Emiri Naval Force.\n\nAmong the eight men are decorated officers, such as Commader (retd) Purnendu Tiwari, who in 2019 was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, the highest honour conferred on overseas Indians by the Indian government.\n\nNow the pressure is on India’s diplomats to save the accused, whose family members have urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene.\n\n“The foreign ministry assured us that it was their priority to bring back our loved ones but there has been nothing concrete. We’re waiting for a quick resolution now because their lives are in danger,” a relative of retired Captain Navtej Gill, who was awarded the President’s Gold Medal for his service in the armed forces, told Nikkei Asia.\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced last week that he had met the families of the men, and that “the Indian government will leave no stone unturned to ensure their release”.\n\nBut Mr Modi’s opponents have been unforgiving, slamming the government for not negotiating the officers’ release earlier.\n\n“It is mystifying why things came to this unfortunate pass. What had the foreign ministry been doing since August 2022?” opposition Congress party spokesperson Manish Tewari posted on X.\n\nThe case puts a strain on bilateral ties that encompass trade and Indian manpower. There are about 700,000 Indians there, Ambassador to Qatar Deepa Gopalan recently told The Hindu.\n\nThe death sentence comes amid an already challenging period for Indian diplomacy, just after a spat erupted with Canada in September over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s revelation of “credible allegations” that Indian agents were behind the killing of a Sikh separatist in British Columbia. New Delhi called the charge “absurd”.\n\nWith regard to the Qatar case, Ms Gopalan stressed that it needs to be taken “up at the highest level to ensure the lives of the accused are saved”.\n\nLegal experts say the lack of transparency around the charges against the navy veterans will complicate the effort.\n\n“The speculation that the men were held on charges of espionage further makes the case a highly sensitive one that will make a quick resolution very difficult,” Indian High Court advocate Prakriti Chadha told Nikkei Asia.\n\nSome draw parallels with the case of another retired Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been held by Pakistan since March 2016.\n\nIslamabad says Jadhav was spying in Balochistan province for India’s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing. He was sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court in 2017, a ruling challenged by the Indian government at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nThe matter is still pending with the ICJ. In 2019, the court rejected India’s appeal for Jadhav’s immediate release but ordered Islamabad to suspend the execution.\n\nWhile Pakistan and India are nuclear-armed rivals, India and Qatar have cordial relations, which one Indian foreign ministry official suggested lends some hope.\n\n“Despite the complexities involved in the Qatar case, we’re confident of tackling the issue successfully via diplomacy,” an anonymous official told Nikkei Asia.\n\nForeign policy experts emphasise that government-to-government talks are the best way forward.\n\nObserver Research Foundation fellow Kabir Taneja, who specialises in West Asia, posted on X that India should “operationalise the prisoner exchange deal that it had signed with Qatar in 2015”.\n\nUnder the agreement, in theory, Qatari citizens convicted in India could be sent back to their country in exchange for the release of the Indian navy personnel.\n\nBut Mr Modi’s solidarity with Israel over the recent Hamas attack could be a stumbling block. Qatar blames Israeli actions against the Palestinians as a trigger for the attack.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“The speculation that the men were held on charges of espionage further makes the case a highly sensitive one that will make a quick resolution very difficult.”\n\nIndian High Court advocate Prakriti Chadha", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0a5f17ce9276ea005c95b9e67d795dac592b38816648652fd3630a7cb72f4b18?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian External Affairs Minister S.

Yes, sari over sneakers.\n\n“Of course, you have to look traditional when you go to the temple,” said Mrs Jessica Partibhan, owner of Aksha Weaves at Belilios Lane.\n\n“But you can sport something trendy when you are dancing or partying. I see more of this happening when people enjoy the festival in groups. They just want to let their hair down.\n\n“Our Deepavali collection saris now have more rose gold, copper and copper zaris (gold thread used decoratively on Indian clothing). It used to be just gold or silver.”\n\nMake-up artist Chandni Sahu said “women are becoming more experimental”.\n\n“They are excited to dress up, wear jewellery and look well-groomed. They prefer nude make-up, showing off their natural looks.”\n\nKathak dancer and teacher Shaily Badkul believes women prioritise comfort. “We want to dance and party and not let our heels slow us down. So, we wear sneakers, shoes, sunglasses... which are cool and comfortable.”\n\nThe sari, a symbol of grace and resilience, sits well with today’s women who are strong, confident and tenacious, according to Ms Anu Samtani, owner of events and entertainment company Action Reply.\n\n“I like to express myself by being comfortable in my own shoes, combined with my own style, swag and simplicity. This Deepavali, a beautiful Jamdani sari with my favourite pair of sneakers will make me feel festive and fabulous.”\n\nMrs Asia Worldwide 2023 Chilakal Vijaya Durga said Deepavali is not just about lighting lamps and enjoying sweets. “It is also a time to express your individuality through your fashion choices.”\n\nShe added: “Covid prompted us to re-evaluate our priorities and reinvent ourselves and fashion trends while sticking to our roots. Fusion wear can be incredibly chic and comfortable – perfect for a long day of festivities.”\n\nGraphics designer Shilpi Seth, who has created her own sneakers, said: “Mixing saris with sneakers is mixing style with comfort, the Western twist making the Indian outfit shine.”\n\nDespite the “hot and bold” moves to stand out in a crowd, entrepreneur and Kamala Club president Padmaja Yerramsetty said women are now replacing extravagant and fancy jewellery pieces with subtle ones.\n\n“They will go for whatever they feel is unique – jeans, shoes, belts and spaghetti straps with saris. But this Deepavali, less is more – delicate necklaces, small ear-studs, simple bangles. Subtle pieces of jewellery can complement your attire without upstaging your overall look. The charm lies in understated elegance.”\n\n“Of course, you have to look traditional when you go to the temple.

The store has an in-house craftsman who can advise on jewellery production and repair. There are also 16 other employees who can converse in 14 Indian languages.\n\nThis Deepavali, Tanishq is offering its latest Dharohar collection, which features intricately crafted gold jewellery adorned with colourful meenakari enamel work and unique uncut diamonds or polki, symbolising the timeless cultural values that are treasured and passed down as heirlooms.\n\nV.K.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe National Skin Centre (NSC) has honoured the late Associate Professor Venketesan Sundarajan by naming the auditorium in its new building at Mandalay Road after him.\n\nInaugurated on Oct 25, the auditorium is part of the expanded NSC, which is more than double the size of its former building.\n\n“The fact that he is honoured many years after his death is a true testament to the impact he left on the dermato-venereology sector in Singapore,” said his widow Kokila, 82.\n\n“He looked stern but was actually big-hearted, always helping others. He would invite the hospital staff to our home for Deepavali. I remember his secretary describing him as ‘a gem’.”\n\nIt was also this soft side to Prof Rajan, as he was better known, that sparked a flurry of messages from doctors from around the world following his death.\n\n“He was a caring and compassionate person who would help the needy without fanfare,” said family friend Sumitra Bala Subramanion, recounting how a senior woman was inconsolable at Prof Rajan’s wake. It turned out that he had been providing financial support to the woman’s family.\n\nProf Rajan played a major role in the development of dermatology and venereology in Singapore. He died in 1983, at age 49.\n\nAs medical superintendent of Middle Road Hospital from 1972 to 1983, he spearheaded the establishment of facilities and services for mycology, dermato-pathology and dermato-immunology. He was also instrumental in developing the Sexually Transmitted Infections Public Health programme to one of international recognition.\n\n“Having been at the helm when plans to establish NSC began in the early-1980s, Prof Rajan laid the foundational need for the country’s first purpose-built specialty centre,” said NSC director Tan Suat Hoon.\n\n“It is befitting that the auditorium in the new NSC building is named in his honour, not only to reflect the enduring and profound effects of his life’s work, but also to serve as a beacon inspiring current and future generations of dermatologists to strive for progress and excellence in this field.”\n\nProf Rajan’s legacy of educational excellence lives on through the Dermatological Society of Singapore’s V.S. Rajan Gold Medal, an award for medical students excelling in dermatology.\n\nBut it was not all work and no play for the 1980 Public Administration Gold Medal honoree.\n\nAccording to Madam Kokila, her late husband, who was on the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society’s management committee from 1970 to 1983, was “very passionate about music”.\n\nHe was also a member of the Hindu Advisory Board and the Tamil Language Cultural Society, and vice-president of the Indian Education Trust.\n\n“He looked stern but was actually big-hearted, always helping others.”\n\nMadam Kokila (left) on her late husband, Prof Venketesan Sundarajan (above)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4135b6056978af02e70b24d911217ade171dfc1c08f8bba806164cf44b703475?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/113006025a77f567471c3591c3a2965bb3d22fb3179268863cdce757ff0a7351?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4135b6056978af02e70b24d911217ade171dfc1c08f8bba806164cf44b703475?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/113006025a77f567471c3591c3a2965bb3d22fb3179268863cdce757ff0a7351?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4135b6056978af02e70b24d911217ade171dfc1c08f8bba806164cf44b703475?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nHe played an innings that will remain as unforgettable as a Beatles song, gritty and glittering, battling through pain to an incredible triumph.\n\nOn Tuesday, Glenn Maxwell scripted a tale laced with resilience, audacity and indomitable cricketing prowess to steer Australia to a miraculous three-wicket win over Afghanistan in the World Cup.\n\nThe Australian all-rounder smashed 201 not out in a 292-run chase at the Wankade Stadium in Mumbai, and it comes as no surprise that many cricketers are already calling the innings the greatest of all time.\n\nAnd it might not be far-fetched: Australia may have won five World Cup titles, but Maxwell’s knock ensured the victory against Afghanistan was one of their sweetest – and certainly among the most memorable – in the tournament’s history.\n\nThe biggest case for Maxwell’s extraordinary innings to be considered the “greatest” is that it unfolded in the World Cup, an event that defines careers and legacies.\n\nAustralia, on paper, were the overwhelming favourites against Afghanistan. They were reeling at 49-4 when Maxwell arrived at the crease. They then slumped to 91-7.\n\nBut the stage was set for Maxwell, who somehow managed to seize the moment despite being dropped twice on 24 and 33. His journey to the historic double century was fraught with adversity, both external and internal.\n\nDrops, reviews, cramps and physical agony punctuated Maxwell’s innings. His ability to run was compromised as the innings grew. By the time the requirement was down to 75 runs, he could barely move his feet to play a shot.\n\nYet, the physical distress became a backdrop to his extraordinary display, as Maxwell’s exceptional hand-eye coordination and near-perfect ball-striking abilities made up for the other limitations.\n\nHis record-shattering 201 not out marked the first instance in the history of ODIs where an individual achieved a double century while chasing. What further distinguishes his feat is that he accomplished this remarkable milestone as a non-opening batter.\n\nOver the past few decades, Kapil Dev’s 175 off just 138 balls gainst Zimbabwe, West Indies great Vivian Richards’ 189 off 170 balls, Sachin Tendulkar’s 143 versus Australia, Herschelle Gibbs’ 175 in a record 435-run chase and Rohit Sharma’s world record 264 have made the world stand and applaud.\n\nOn Tuesday, from Pakistan legend Wasim Akram to former English captain Michael Vaughan and Australian captain Pat Cummins – who had the best seat in the house at the non-striker’s end for a large part of Maxwell’s knock – all labelled the 201 not out as the “greatest”.\n\nAnd when big names in world cricket make such a claim, one has to take notice.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cc1e5a4ef61021fb1fca5cfd184a215eeeb148a63da352ab5cde130a0444ecf4?w=825", "alt_text": "Australia’s Glenn Maxwell plays a shot during the  match between Australia and Afghanistan."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nUnder pressure, Afghanistan capitulated against Australia at the cricket World Cup in Mumbai on Tuesday.\n\nLike how they fell apart against Singapore in a World Cricket League Division Five match in Jersey in 2008.\n\nAfter the match was reduced to 30 overs due to rain, Singapore totalled 145 in 29.3 overs. Afghanistan then collapsed to 76 all out in 20.2 overs.\n\nFormer Singapore captain Chetan Suryawanshi said: “Afghanistan were the favourites to win the tournament and they played well. But against us, they suffered a blip.\n\n“We could see that they were deeply affected by the loss. The whole team was in tears, they sat in the dressing room for three hours.”\n\nMohammad Nabi top-scored for Afghanistan with 26. The 38-year-old is the only player from the 2008 team who is playing in the current World Cup.\n\nSingapore finished third after the league stage, on equal points with Afghanistan but with a lower net run rate. Afghanistan went on to beat Jersey by two wickets in the final, which launched their incredible rise in world cricket.\n\nThe Afghans found entry to the T20 World Cup in 2010, played their first one-day international against a Test nation in 2012, made their 50-overs World Cup debut in 2015 and featured in their first Test in 2018.\n\nAfghanistan currently rank No. 10 in the world. Singapore’s ranking is 36th.\n\n“Even in Jersey I could see that they were determined to reach the top,” said Chetan.\n\n“They did not have proper equipment, so I gave them a few bats and gloves. In return, they gave me 4kg of dry fruits.\n\n“Only Nabi looked technically sound, but the others were aggressive. They had no fear, and were ready to take on any fast bowler.”\n\nChetan recounted an incident in 2007 at the MRF academy in Chennai when helmetless Afghan batsman Karim Sadiq faced Australian tearaway Mitchell Johnson in the nets. “I asked Karim how he dared to face Johnson without a helmet. He pulled up his trousers and showed me his leg, which had gunshot scars. He said: ‘If I can survive that, a cricket ball is nothing.’”\n\nFormer Singapore captain Munish Arora, who played against Afghanistan in a T20 qualifier in Dubai in 2009, said the Afghans “can chase down 300 and defend 100”.\n\n“It was their passion and fighting spirit that led them to gaining ODI status ahead of all other big associate nations, and it is their determination to excel at the highest level that kept West Indies out of this World Cup and forced Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to qualify,” said Munish.\n\n“Their middle order used to be a problem with constant collapses, but their captain Hashmatullah Shahidi has shored up things. And with a potent spin attack of Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmed, Nabi and Mujeeb Ur Rahman, they could very well qualify for the World Cup semi-finals.”\n\nIf Afghanistan beat South Africa today and other results turn out in their favour over the next few days, they might face India in the semi-fnal.\n\nSingapore umpire Sarika Prasad, who has watched the Afghans progress over the past 18 years, reckons that they are fully capable of pulling off a surprise. “It has been tough for them with the Taliban rule and wars, but they are a steely lot. They do not have good training facilities at home, and play their international matches in Dubai and India. With the support of the Indian and Nepal boards, they have achieved a lot.\n\n“The Taliban supports men’s cricket and the team and more than 3,000 supporters turn up to cheer them at every match. The Afghans won’t give up without a fight. They play hard and are a treat to watch.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/62982b9ecb6109160d7daa3b840af43290cecc8bd1a5f3e28c176eaa1537e4d7?w=825", "alt_text": "Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi during a practice session in Lucknow."}]}

It has different news categories including local, world, India, sports and entertainment.\n\nOther contents include short videos, podcasts on community issues and trends, as well as specially curated photo galleries and articles on astrology, food and home remedies.\n\nContent from the English weekly\n\ntabla!\n\nis also featured.\n\n“If you are looking for quick news, we have that,” said Mr Venga Subramaniam, digital editor, Tamil Murasu. “For those who want in-depth analysis, we have that, too.”\n\nSPH Media chief executive Teo Lay Lim said the app “marks a new chapter for Tamil Murasu, and we will continue to strive to bring the best experiences to our audiences”.\n\nThe app has been well-received by users such as Indian Heritage Centre general manager Bhavani Dass, who said the app would benefit the community.\n\n“The younger generation, in particular, will love it as they will get to read bite-sized news in an appealing packaging,” she said.\n\nAccounts executive P. Ram, 32, said the multimedia platform is highly engaging with its one-minute news videos and informative short reads: “Life in Singapore is hectic, and you spend a lot of time commuting. These segments come in handy in keeping abreast of the latest news that impact the community.”\n\nMusic composer and local rapper Yung Raja, who performed at the launch, was just as impressed with the app.\n\n“I get the Tamil Murasu paper daily at home, but this is so convenient. It is a wonderful thing for the Tamil community, especially the youth. It will certainly help bridge the gap between the youth and the Tamil community.”\n\nNanyang Technological University freshman N.J. Pravin, who loves the movie ticket booking function, said: “Tamil Murasu’s content is much more diverse than just hard, dry news. I have seen food and entertainment reviews on its social media platform.”\n\nThe app can be enjoyed even by readers who are not fluent in Tamil.\n\n“The text-to-speech function comes in handy for those who cannot read Tamil. It will encourage more people to follow Tamil news with this app,” said marketing professional Sudha Jayaraman, 41.\n\n“I get the Tamil Murasu paper daily at home, but this is so convenient.

I cultivated the spirit of volunteerism in her and now, at 25, she is an active volunteer.”\n\nMr Kumar believes the young should start volunteering early, and the encouragement must come from the elders. “It is the parents’ duty to instil the importance of volunteering in their children and educate them,” he said.\n\nThe chief sustainability officer and vice-president of global operations at Ennovi Holdings has to travel for work half the time but still makes space for activities such as outreach programmes, organising events for the neighbourhood and integrating foreigners into the local community.\n\nHe credits cricket for teaching him the right values and the essence of proper time management.\n\nThe former national player said the sport demands endurance and good mental strength, and teaches leadership skills. He has kept wickets and opened the batting for various teams, captained the Singapore Recreation Club and Singapore Indian Association (IA) teams and mentored several youngsters when IA won the local league titles.\n\n“Dealing with people from different backgrounds, managing them and bringing them together as a team to excel are what I love the most about the sport,” said Mr Kumar, who stopped playing 13 years ago but still keeps abreast of the developments in  local cricket.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/15b6b54b81534618ee4d15876afb9f9e81a10f044f4e5bc2e1cfb99f75d1cc54?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Chandran Nantha Kumar receiving the Public Service Medal from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam."}]}

Narayana Murthy has kicked up a storm online, after exhorting youngsters last week to be prepared to work 70 hours a week for India to effectively compete with developed nations.\n\n“India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world. Unless we improve our work productivity, we will not be able to compete with those countries that have made tremendous progress. My request is that our youngsters must say, ‘This is my country and I want to work 70 hours a week,’ just like what the Germans and Japanese did after WWII,” said Mr Murthy.\n\nThe 77-year-old made the comment in a conversation with veteran investor and former Infosys chief financial officer Mohandas Pai in the first episode of investment firm 3one4 Capital’s podcast The Record.\n\nMr Murthy, whose son-in-law is British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, said India’s work culture has to become highly determined, extremely disciplined and hardworking, and called on the youngsters to take the lead in this “transformation”.\n\nAs soon as the podcast went live on YouTube, comments began to flood in, with the online community divided over Mr Murthy’s remarks.\n\nJSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal showed his support, explaining that a five-day week is not a fit for a developing nation of India’s size.\n\nOla cofounder Bhavish Aggarwal tweeted: “Totally agree with Mr Murthy’s views. It’s not our moment to work less and entertain ourselves. Rather, it’s our moment to go all in and build in one generation what other countries have built over many generations!”\n\nFormer managing director and cofounder of BharatPe Ashneer Grover offered a rather nuanced take: “I think people got offended here because work is still being measured in ‘hours’ than ‘outcome’ and it is said as if our youth’s laziness is the only thing keeping India from becoming developed. Funny how getting offended unites us more than cricket, religion, caste or language.”\n\nNetizens on X slammed Mr Murthy’s comments, while political representatives compared Infosys to a sweatshop and others drew a similarity between the proposal and modern slavery. There were arguments over work-life balance and how working 70 hours a week can impact mental health.\n\nSome highlighted how excessive working hours could hamper personal commitments and impact the mental well-being of employees.\n\nMeanwhile, Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO and managing director Radhika Gupta posted on X: “Between offices and homes, many Indian women have been working many more than 70-hour weeks to build India (through our work) and the next generation of Indians (our children). For years and decades. Funnily, no one has debated about us on Twitter.”\n\nEdtech platform upGrad’s cofounder and chairperson Ronnie Screwvala begged to differ with Mr Murthy’s argument, saying that boosting productivity was not just about long work hours but rather a by-product of upskilling, and positive and fair pay.\n\nMenstruation-focussed D2C Ayurveda brand Menoveda’s cofounder Tamanna Singh, citing existing research, said that excessive working hours could lead to diminishing returns in productivity.\n\n“Startups, in particular, rely heavily on innovation, which flourishes in an atmosphere that encourages mental and physical wellness. Nurturing such an environment is not just a matter of corporate social responsibility, it is a strategic imperative that ensures the long-term success and resilience of businesses.”\n\nThe work-life balance debate transcends geographical boundaries.\n\nBillionaire workaholic Elon Musk reportedly emailed employees at 2am, telling them to be “extremely hardcore” and work “long hours at high intensity”. That led to resignations.\n\nIn 2019, Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma’s comment that young people should work 12 hours a day, six days a week, sparked a controversy. Later that year, he said people could just work three days a week, four hours a day with the help of technology.\n\nIndo-Asian News service\n\n“My request is that our youngsters must say, ‘This is my country and I want to work 70 hours a week,’ just like what the Germans and Japanese did after WWII.”\n\nMr N.R.

DBS will also not be allowed to reduce the number of its branches and automated teller machines.\n\nSea-level rise less of a threat to coastline\n\nSingapore’s coastlines may not be threatened by sea-level rise quite to the extent previously thought, according to researchers here.\n\nRising sea levels due to climate change often cause coasts to retreat but researchers from the Nanyang Technological University’s Earth Observatory of Singapore found that coastal areas in southern Singapore – where the Kallang River Basin is – will remain intact even at high rates of sea level rise, owing to large amounts of sedimentation deposits.\n\nUncertified practitioner accused of injecting Botox into three women\n\nFor injecting Botox into three women illegally, Eleana Lim Chui Xia, 33, was on Thursday charged with three counts of doing an act as a medical practitioner without being registered and having a valid practising certificate – an offence under the Medical Registration Act.\n\nShe allegedly injected a mixture of Botox and saline solution into both sides of a 36-year-old woman’s jaw on Dec 11, 2020. The following year, she allegedly injected the same mixture into the calves of a 31-year-old woman on May 18 and into the underarms of a 26-year-old woman on July 30.\n\nFood caterer fined $6,000 for hygiene lapses after 92 suffered food poisoning\n\nKG Catering was fined $6,000 on Wednesday for multiple hygiene violations, after 92 people who ate food prepared by the caterer suffered food poisoning.\n\nThe gastroenteritis cases happened across three incidents and were reported to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and Ministry of Health between Sept 20, 2022, and March 11, 2023. Gastroenteritis symptoms include diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\nNone was hospitalised, SFA said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nForeigners in Singapore reminded not to support or import foreign politics\n\nForeigners should avoid using Singapore as a platform to further their political causes amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).\n\nOn Thursday, a joint advisory by MOM, Internal Security Department and Ministry of Home Affairs also cautioned those working or living in Singapore against supporting or importing foreign politics here.

It is occasion-wear and not that glamorous.\n\n“I am a third-generation Indian-Singaporean, born and brought up here, so I know what works for my customers. It shows in the motifs, colours and designs I use.”\n\nThe 49-year-old, who showcased her 10-piece ready-to-wear spring/summer 2024 collection at Paris Fashion Week last month, appears to be pragmatic and practical in her designs.\n\nEarlier, she won the Singapore Stories Award 2022, a national fashion design competition held by the Singapore Fashion Council in collaboration with the Asian Civilisations Museum.\n\n“From a designer’s point of view, Paris is like graduation, an endorsement that you have arrived,” said the woman behind Indian boutique Stylemart at Selegie Road.\n\n“It was very gratifying. I got to reflect on my cultural heritage and craft through my designs.\n\n“I am an Indian but I don’t see things differently from people of other ethnic groups in Singapore. I borrow or adapt from the other cultures. I am able to fuse that harmoniously in my works. These are genuinely visible in the concepts that I create.\n\n“They represent Singapore. I make sure each and every garment has a certain aesthetic resemblance to our culture. It may be in the silhouette, it may be in the embroidery, it may be in the technique. Somehow, everything just comes together naturally.”\n\nMs Kavita, who took over the family business from her Sindhi mother Huri Baxani, has come a long way since she displayed her first collection at the Grand Hyatt Singapore in 1993.\n\n“I’ve been honing my craft for over 30 years. I’m very proud of it and I stand by it,” she said.\n\n“I always tell young designers they should stop mimicking the West. We have so much in our culture, identity and heritage, and these must be highlighted.\n\n“If you look at the fashion scene, the world is taking notice of Indian designers. India is the fashion capital of Asia, and a large part of the best textile craft comes from India.”\n\nMs Kavita’s family brand has been known for its Indian bridal and occasion wear since the 1980s.\n\nThe presentation in Paris allowed her to show that her work extended beyond the box of ethnic wear to fusion wear.\n\nThe collection displayed intricate forms of embroidery and a particularly intensive form of thread work from Kashmir. These traditional techniques were paired with Western and Asian silhouettes like jumpsuits and crop tops, as well as the sari and qipao.\n\n“I think I was well-received by the largely European audience,” said Ms Kavita.\n\n“About half of the collection was snapped up in the first three days. The love and support I got from the Indian community was terrific. Many were very proud that one of them represented Singapore.\n\n“I was known as an Indian designer. Now they are acknowledging me as a designer who can make any kind of fashion wear.\n\n“I feel no designer should be put in a box. The Indian fashion scene was my forte, that was my family business. But I’m constantly evolving and looking at new ideas and inspirations.\n\n“I have shown that I can do anything and everything as long as I am given the opportunity and platform.”\n\n“I am a third-generation Indian-Singaporean, born and brought up here, so I know what works for my customers.

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhile both teams still had one round left to play in the World Cup, cricket lovers were already looking forward to Sunday, when India take on South Africa at the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nThe tournament’s two most impressive sides – India with their all-round strength and South Africa with their power-hitting – were at the top of the league table after six rounds. South Africa had played a game more, while India were set to play Sri Lanka yesterday.\n\nFormer South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes the match in Kolkata will be memorable for the players. He knows what it is to play India in India, having been captain when they faced India at Nagpur in the 2011 World Cup.\n\n“India have been incredible in this tournament,” he said. “I haven’t played India at Eden Gardens but the pitch, vibe and atmosphere are incredible. It’s going to be an occasion to remember for this South African team.”\n\nExcept for a blip against the Netherlands, South Africa have blown away their opponents, pulling off a nerve-wracking chase over Pakistan and a commanding win over New Zealand, who are fourth on the table.\n\nMeanwhile, India have been sensational with an all-win record, up to their match against Sri Lanka yesterday.\n\nSmith feels India’s players have handled the pressure of expectations very well. “Everyone expected India to do well and I think they have handled the expectations of handling a home World Cup really well,” he said.\n\n“Also, that Virat Kohli (355 runs at 88.50 after six matches) and Rohit Sharma (398 runs at 66.33 after six matches) have had big tournaments is important to them.”\n\nWhile the top batters have come to the party for India, Smith was also bowled over by the home team’s bowling performance in Lucknow against England on Sunday.\n\nIndia’s batting didn’t really click, and they were left to defend a below par 229. But Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami bowled searing opening spells to prise open the game for India by reducing the defending champions to 39-4.\n\n“The injury to Hardik Pandya messes with the balance but the bowling is a standout,” said Smith. “Lots of attacking weapons, they have three seamers who can take wickets.\n\n“Bumrah is back to his best. The two spinners have been outstanding. It’s been a batter-dominated tournament with lots of high scores, but India have had five bowlers who can pick wickets at any time, which is an asset to control teams.”\n\nAll-rounder Pandya is expected to sit out against South Africa, as he continues to recover from an ankle injury he suffered against Bangladesh.\n\nRohit’s captaincy has been spot-on and the knock of 87 off 101 balls on a difficult pitch was a masterpiece.\n\n“Rohit’s been excellent. He’s been batting at his best,” said Smith. “He’s a very calm guy with a relaxed demeanour. His tactical decision-making has been very good.”\n\nShreyas Iyer’s game against the short ball remains a cause of concern. Against England, he picked the wrong length to pull and was caught at mind-on.\n\n“It’s been going on with Shreyas for a while,” said Smith. “It’s also slightly technical. I am sure they are working on it in the nets.”\n\nThe only conundrum India face is around their team combination. With Pandya injured, they have included Suryakumar Yadav and Shami in their XI, with both players delivering crucial contributions.\n\nWhile Shami has picked nine wickets in two games, Surya made up for his run out against New Zealand with a crucial 49 against England.\n\nSurya’s rise at No. 6 will make the equation trickier once Hardik is back. Who goes out once he returns? Well, on current form it looks like the axe could fall on Iyer. With scores of 0, 25, 53, 19, 33 and 4, Iyer has 134 runs at 33.5 while batting at No. 4.\n\nSouth Africa held their nerve to scrape past Pakistan by one wicket, but they will need to do more to show they can handle the pressure.\n\n“The funny thing about the World Cup is, they came in with no expectation but have exceeded expectation, playing so well,” said Smith. “The game against Pakistan on a slow surface in Chennai was a good one for them to win. I don’t see why batting first or second, that batting line-up can’t do well. I wouldn’t think too much about it.”\n\nBatsman Rassie van der Dussen, who made 133 against New Zealand on Wednesday, his second hundred of the tournament, made no attempt to downplay the extent of the challenge confronting them on Sunday.\n\n“Playing India in India is a massive event,” the 34-year-old said. “They’ve been playing really well. They’ve got all bases covered, a brilliant bowling attack and obviously the batting as well.\n\n“But we’ll go into that game knowing that if we do the things well that we want to do, we’ll be in a really strong position. The challenge is to do that under pressure, to stay with that.\n\n“But we’ve played them here before, and we’ve beaten them here (in India) before. So even though it’s a World Cup, it’s not really too much different.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service, AFP\n\n“I haven’t played India at Eden Gardens but the pitch, vibe and atmosphere are incredible.

The court specifically ordered Ayesha to facilitate bringing their son to India for visitation purposes, which included overnight stays with Dhawan and his family, especially during school holidays.\n\nHowever, it appears that Dhawan is still facing challenges in establishing connections with his son.\n\n“It’s been a year since I saw you in person, and now, for almost three months, I’ve been blocked from everywhere. So posting the same picture to wish you, my boy, a very Happy Birthday, Dhawan wrote.\n\n“Even if I can’t connect with you directly, I connect with you through telepathy. I am so proud of you, and I know you’re doing great and growing up nicely.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c4fa87f812fa5a06b7ba90163d933084acc4a106035553f717f2b3e088ead912?w=825", "alt_text": "Shikhar Dhawan with his son Zoravar."}]}

Kennedy, best known for officiating during the early years of the Singapore Premier League (SPL), died on Dec 26 aged 59.\n\nIn accordance with his family’s wishes, the cause of his death was not made public. Kennedy, who was also a former teacher at Loyang Secondary School, was single, having never married.\n\n“He was a dedicated and filial son, right from the beginning, and he will be dearly missed by his family and loved ones,” his family said.\n\nEasily recognised for his uneven skin tone on his face and body – caused by a pigmentation issue – Kennedy left a lasting impression in the field of football officiating.\n\nAfter his playing career, which included playing for local semi-professional side Tyrwhitt Soccerites in the late 1980s, he refereed SPL matches and numerous international tournaments from the mid-1990s to 2005.\n\nKennedy also showed his steadfast dedication to helping the underprivileged. When he won the SPL Best Referee Award in 2002, he donated his season’s refereeing stipend and $5,000 prize money to the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.\n\nIn a condolence message on Facebook, the Football Association of Singapore wrote: “While he adopted a no-nonsense approach on the field, Kennedy had a softer demeanour off the pitch and was passionate about caring for the needy in the community.”\n\nFootball enthusiast A. Thiyaga Raju, author of the book ROAR – Football Legends Of Singapore, said Kennedy was one of the finest referees Singapore has produced.\n\n“At the annual Cooper (fitness) test for referees, Kennedy would be the one setting the highest bar to inspire the younger referees – less than 12 minutes for the 3.2km run,” he said.\n\nHe related an incident in 1998 when Kennedy missed his brother’s engagement ceremony to officiate an SPL game between SAFFC and Jurong FC at Jurong Stadium.\n\n“A gentle and modest individual, his passing is a significant loss to the refereeing community,” said Raju.\n\nFormer journalist and football referee Suresh Nair said Kennedy was respected by his cohort for making “brave decisions” during matches. He also referenced an incident when Kennedy was jeered over his skin condition by fans during a match in Malaysia.\n\n“Kennedy was a very intelligent and skilled referee,” said Suresh. “He was unquestionably an inspiration to all local referees, both the younger ones and those of his era.”\n\nFormer national team captain Terry Pathmanathan, who knew Kennedy for more than 25 years, remembered him as a “warm and compassionate” person.\n\n“Only when he became a referee did Kennedy, a football player, get recognition,” said Terry.\n\n“His fearless demeanour and unbiased judgement on the field made him exceptional.

Santosh Kumar\n\nNetflix’s latest crime docuseries Curry & Cyanide – The Jolly Joseph Case is making waves among Netflix viewers.\n\nDirected by Christo Tomy and produced by India Today Originals, it currently ranks No. 3 in India and No. 7 in Singapore.\n\nThe series revisits the horrific cyanide killings in Kerala’s Koodathayi, where a woman, Jolly Joseph, allegedly poisoned and killed six people, including her family members and a two-year-old girl.\n\nThe incidents came to light in 2019, when Jolly was arrested for allegedly committing the crimes over 14 years.\n\nIn a case that shook India, the middle-aged Jolly is said to have poisoned and killed both her in-laws, her first husband, the wife of her second husband and his daughter.\n\nThe 95-minute documentary holds the viewer’s attention from start to finish. It examines Jolly’s motive and how her murderous actions remained undetected for such a long time.\n\nThroughout, viewers are given accounts and narratives from various people involved during and after the crimes – mainly retired cop K.G. Simon, who headed the investigation, Jolly’s son Remo, her brother-in-law Rojo, sister-in-law Renji and her advocate B.A. Aloor.\n\nTomy keeps the narrative well-paced and the storytelling gripping. There is never a dull moment, which is rare, given that several documentaries veer towards becoming dull after a point, largely because there is no fiction involved.\n\nDeath due to cyanide has found a way into popular culture and has been featured in several shows before, including the crime thriller web series Dahaad. But Curry & Cyanide is special because it shows that reality can be more troublesome – and indeed more disturbing – than fiction.\n\nHowever, critics have pointed out that, while most of Netflix’s true-crime-based shows follow an episodic format, Curry and Cyanide is cramped into a feature-film duration.\n\nNetflix has arguably been the frontrunner when it comes to delivering gripping content based on true crimes. Delhi Crime, House of Secrets: The Burari Deaths and The Hunt for Veerappan are some of its more popular series, which tapped the Indian audience’s collective interest in examining spine-chilling real-life crimes.\n\nBut its 95-minute restriction for Curry & Cyanide is strange considering the case traverses almost 20 years. As a result, the makers are unable to get into the minute details, which leaves many pondering over a number of questions, besides diluting the gruesomeness of the crimes.\n\nGenerally, what makes such shows popular is how they explore a criminal’s background and psyche.\n\nCurry & Cyanide reveals that Jolly belongs to an agricultural family from the high ranges, who later gets married into the affluent Ponnamattam family.\n\nIt also says that she was an expert at deception, which is evident in how she forged her degree certificates – the starting point of all crimes to follow.\n\nBut the show should have had at least one credible version, probably from a childhood friend or family member, to help viewers understand Jolly and the root cause of her criminal tendencies.\n\nThough Curry & Cyanide is accurate with the depiction of the pain endured by the remaining members of the Ponnamattam family, particularly Rojo and Renji, it fails to dig deep into Jolly’s psyche.\n\nGetting Jolly on camera and speaking about her actions, like what had been done with the docuseries Dancing on the Grave, would have elevated Curry & Cyanide. The perspective of her second husband, Shaju, and the other accomplices are also missing.\n\nBut, given that the case is still ongoing, that would have been difficult to achieve.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\nThe 95-minute decision for Curry & Cyanide is a strange one considering the case traverses a period of almost 20 years.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8f76aee85f53dd2eec76f5bc235391afb5174f703067f22feaf0a05e9c0847c7?w=825", "alt_text": "Curry & Cyanide narrates the cyanide killings in Kerala allegedly committed by Jolly Joseph (right)."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAt a recent media interaction for director Jeo Baby’s Malayalam film Kaathal – The Core, actress Jyothika called her co-actor Mammootty a “real life, true hero”.\n\nAnd after watching him as Mathew Devassy – a middle-aged gay protagonist – in the film, many in India are inclined to agree.\n\nThe veteran plays a retired, married bank clerk with a daughter in college. As he prepares to run in the village elections, his wife, played by Jyothika, files for divorce after discovering he is gay and has a male lover.\n\nThe film has courtroom scenes, but it centres on Mathew’s inner struggle. It also beautifully captures the silence of the household and the rumours circulating in the village.\n\nReleased last month, Kaathal has become a commercial success as well as a critical one. But importantly, according to The New York Times, what stands out is the decision of one of South India’s biggest stars to take on the role of a gay man and portray him so sensitively.\n\nThe dignified and nuanced film, crucially, brings to the fore the importance of how big stars like Mammootty and Jyothika, who returns to the big screen after three years, fit into humble places with much grace.\n\nIt also squashes stereotypes of how an Indian hero should be portrayed on screen, and whether a big-name actor should risk doing an experimental, bold film.\n\nThe director said he thought of just one actor for the role when the writers approached him: Mammootty, a 72-year-old star with a large following in Kerala.\n\n“Mammootty’s decision to both star in and produce Kaathal helped to keep the film, and the subject it tackles, in the public eye,” said Baby.\n\nKaathal also proved another point: Progressive stories that are low-budget and charged with real human drama can also be successes.\n\nIt is an Indian film without song and dance. The lovers don’t share a word, their main interaction a fleeting moment of eye contact in the monsoon rain. There are no car chases and no action stunts. The men are vulnerable. They cry.\n\n“We have a wonderful audience here,” said Baby. “The same audience creates success for mass movies and at the same time for small movies and comedies.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f9f688b6c7de923fd7522d1fdf59da04ce17dd9633a545cdf904ab0d673b653b?w=825", "alt_text": "kaathal29\nJyothika and Mammootty in Kaathal - The Core."}]}

I might hold my own wedding at Kaithal.”\n\nOmani Musab Al-Saaidi, 31, who postponed his own wedding to attend Vidur’s, said: “Indian weddings definitely stand out for their grandeur and cultural significance.\n\n“The attention to detail in the decorations, the stunning outfits and the delicious food make Indian weddings truly unforgettable. It is an experience like no other.”\n\nVidur’s friend Nishant Hazarika observed: “The wedding was so nice that I would want them to marry each other again and again at the same venue!”\n\n“If we had held it in Delhi, people would have been rushing in from work and then leaving within a few hours.”\n\nVidur Abbi on why he chose to have a destination wedding", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1dc8e69045f918ea144f336475b1eecbb0fb3388c148cdb1ed95afde1046dd33?w=825", "alt_text": "The wedding venue at Kaithal Resorts."}]}

He has to take precautions to ensure she doesn’t get injured.\n\nMs Saroja has been suffering from “stiff person syndrome”, a rare neurological disorder characterised by constant painful muscle contractions and spasms, for almost 30 years, and is bed-ridden. The condition has no known cure.\n\nThe couple married in 1984, and they have a daughter and son, Cynthia, 37, and Adrian, 36.\n\nSometime in 1990, when Mrs Saroja was working in a factory, her right eye suddenly swelled up.\n\n“In 1991, my wife started having cramps in her legs. It would cause her immense pain and she would scream all night,” said Mr Saloman.\n\nDoctors could not figure out the cause of the symptoms at first. It was only in 1995 that she was diagnosed as Singapore’s first stiff-person syndrome patient.\n\nMedical bills went up. “Each time she was admitted to the hospital, the bill would come to a few thousand dollars,” said Mr Saloman.\n\nShe also had to undergo a hip replacement operation which cost $33,000. Mr Saloman paid a subsidised fee of $14,000, which wiped out his Medisave account.\n\nHe was then earning $1,800 a month as a storekeeper. Shortly after, he also had to deal with getting retrenched twice – in 1998 and 2001.\n\n“It was only with certain medications that my wife’s pain was reduced. Only then did she stop screaming at night,” he said.\n\nAs her condition worsened – Mrs Saroja also suffers from diabetes – Mr Saloman wrote to the authorities to allow him to employ a helper despite not meeting the minimum required income. It took two years before the family was granted help.\n\nHis initial attempts to make claims under the CPF Dependants’ Protection Scheme, which supports members and their families in case of disability and death, were rejected.\n\nAll the while, Mr Saloman had to raise his children single-handedly. Despite being distracted and saddened by their mother’s daily struggle, they had to be reminded to focus on school and study. They are now working adults who help care for their mother, and with the family’s finances.\n\nCircumstances have improved since those days. This Christmas, the family’s spirits were boosted by members of Sunlove Nursing Home, which has been providing and arranging outpatient care to Ms Saroja for the past six years.\n\nMs Maha Ramesh, assistant manager at Sunlove, said the nursing home also arranges for doctors to do home visits.\n\n“Our staff also visit monthly to change the nasogastric tube used for feeding Mrs Saroja, who is unable to swallow her food,” said Ms Maha, who added that the nursing home has around 300 patients.\n\nMr Saloman was effusive in his praise for Sunlove, and thanked its staff for their “timely assistance” and help through the years.\n\nLooking back on the past 30 years and how he’s had to take care of his wife, he bears “absolutely no regrets”.\n\n“A few times in the past, there were people who urged me to admit my wife into a home and move on with my life – and maybe marry another woman,” he said.  “But I never entertained any of those ideas.”\n\n“A few times, people urged me to admit my wife into a home and move on with my life – and maybe marry another woman. “But I never entertained any of those ideas.”\n\nMr Pichaymuthu Saloman", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2654e2457b4367d09911ba48fa4a7e9d6408bc5ec5aa2a5d15765b14445b3b66?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Pichaymuthu Saloman with his wife and members of Sunlove Nursing Home on Christmas Day."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe film and political fraternities in Tamil Nadu were in deep mourning on Thursday over the death of actor-politician Vijayakanth (far right) in Chennai following an illness. He was 71.\n\nDesiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), the political party that he founded, had earlier in the day informed through a post on its official X handle that Vijayakanth was admitted to MIOT Hospital and put on ventilator support after he complained of breathing problems.\n\nLast month, he was admitted to the same hospital as his health deteriorated. Suffering from cough and throat pain, he was kept under observation for 14 days.\n\nVijayakanth had been ill and kept a low profile for the past five years, and his wife Premalatha formally took over the reins of the DMDK on Dec 14.\n\nVisuals from outside the hospital on Thursday showed DMDK supporters and fans mourning the death of the popular actor-leader.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi extended condolences to his family, fans and followers.\n\n“A legend of the Tamil film world, his charismatic performances captured the hearts of millions. As a political leader, he was deeply committed to public service, leaving a lasting impact on Tamil Nadu’s political landscape,” Mr Modi said in a social media post.\n\n“His passing leaves a void that will be hard to fill. He was a close friend and I fondly recall my interactions with him over the years. In this sad hour, my thoughts are with his family, fans and numerous followers. Om Shanti.”\n\nVeteran actor Kamal Haasan said he was “deeply saddened” by Vijayakanth’s death, and called him “a revolutionary artist” both in the fields of cinema and politics.\n\n“He lived with humanity in every action. He was the creator of innovative ideas in Tamil Nadu politics. He had a helping hand extended to the poor. Fearless courage was his hallmark. Vijayakanth will remain forever in our memories,” Kamal wrote on X.\n\nFondly referred to as “Captain” owing to his on-screen portrayal of military characters, Vijayakanth established himself as a versatile actor with a successful career in cinema. He featured in 154 movies before venturing into politics.\n\nHe founded the DMDK in 2005 with the aim of providing an alternative political platform in Tamil Nadu, challenging the established Dravidian parties like the DMK and AIADMK.\n\nThe party made its electoral debut in the 2006 Tamil Nadu assembly elections, making an immediate impact and establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the state’s politics.\n\nIn the 2011 state elections, it scripted history, winning more seats than the DMK and becoming the principal opposition party.\n\nVijayakanth, who served as a member of the legislative assembly twice, representing the Virudhachalam and Rishivandiyam constituencies, served as the leader of the opposition in the assembly from 2011 to 2016.\n\nHe soon emerged as a strong political challenger to AIADMK leader J. Jayalalithaa and DMK president M Karunanidhi, and many thought his DMDK could become an alternative to the Dravidian parties.\n\nBut a fallout with Ms Jayalalithaa scuppered his chances.\n\nThe DMDK fought the 2014 parliamentary elections under the umbrella of the National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, but did not achieve significant success. It soon faced internal challenges, including defections of key leaders, which impacted its electoral performance in subsequent elections.\n\nIn the 2016, 2019 and 2021 elections, the DMDK did not perform well as Vijayakanth battled health complications and remained away from the public eye.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d4fc5208b85f6d5b6c991e7de69b0f400b0c842ec5618db20de6a2ffef2de835?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Gnaselvan is a first-year student in the common engineering programme.\n\nBoth enrolled at the polytechnic in April this year. Ms Visalatchi went directly to Year 2, having transferred from an ITE.\n\nWhile children usually have reservations sharing school space with their parent, for this pair it was initially the other way around.\n\nMs Visalatchi, now in her second year of studies, said she was reluctant at first to study in the same institution as her son.\n\n“I was afraid my presence would hamper his freedom,” she said. “But my son was very excited about it.\n\n“I felt very shy sitting with children of my son’s age in class. It was weird, and I was once even on the verge of dropping out.\n\n“But my son, his friends, my classmates and teachers all understood my hesitation and fear, and they made sure I didn’t feel alone. Their love and encouragement keeps me going.”\n\nGnaselvan said his mum is also like his “best buddy” now, and he enjoys their daily routine of travelling to campus together in the mornings.\n\n“It’s quality bonding time,” he said. “My friends are fond of her too.\n\n“My mum got along well with her classmates and my friends within weeks of joining. She also surprised everyone by picking up Gen Z slang rather quickly.\n\n“Talking to her these days feels like talking to my friend.”\n\nMs Visalatchi, who got married in 2001, quit her marketing job when she gave birth to her first child in 2005. She became a housewife thereafter.\n\n“Usually a woman’s world shrinks after having children. I was like that too. It was only after my children grew up that I felt I had lost my identity,” she said.\n\nWhen all three of her children began school, Ms Visalatchi realised that she had time to rejoin the workforce, and she began working at a school canteen.\n\n“I wanted to spend time with my kids. I chose to work in a school canteen so that I could also have a break during the school holidays,” she said.\n\nOne day an elderly customer asked her: “You look like an educated woman, what makes you work here?”\n\nThe question made her reassess her life.\n\nDuring the conversation, the man also referred her to a nursing home that was looking for caretakers.\n\n“The job fuelled my interest in the health sector,” she said.\n\nAfter a few months of employment, Ms Visalatchi enrolled in the SkillsFuture programme to learn the fundamentals of the healthcare industry. She began working as an assistant nurse at National University Hospital in 2020.\n\n“Caring for patients every day was an immense joy. I no longer believe that people work only to make money,” she said.\n\nConstantly striving to improve herself in the field, she continued her nursing studies at an ITE, before earning good grades and subsequently, admission to Nanyang Polytechnic.\n\nThis coincided with her eldest son completing his O-levels.\n\n“It’s crucial to realise our identities in life,” said Ms Visalatchi. “Women frequently lose a sense of their capabilities as they devote more time to their families, but we should keep working towards our goals.\n\n“If families witness our dedication and enthusiasm, they will quickly get to understand us.”\n\n“I felt very shy sitting with children of my son’s age in class.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAn eight-year-old Indian-British schoolgirl has made chess history after being named the best female player at a European championship.\n\nBodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow in north-west London, won the European Blitz Chess Championship in Zagreb, Croatia, last Sunday.\n\nShe went head-to-head with some of the best players in the world and defeated an international master to win her crown.\n\n“Eight-year-old super talented Bodhana Sivanandan made an astonishing result in the blitz competition. She scored 8.5 out of 13 points to win the first prize and earn 211.2 blitz ELO points,” said the European Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships.\n\nA few months ago, Bodhana was among a group of young chess enthusiasts invited by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to 10 Downing Street to mark the government’s 1-million pound investment package for the game.\n\nThe package has since been in place to support children attending schools in disadvantaged areas across England to learn and play chess.\n\nThe tournament was played in blitz format – a quick form of chess where players have just minutes on their clocks for their moves.\n\nEnglish Chess Federation (ECF) chairman Stephen Woodhouse said: “There are three types of timings in a chess game – standard, rapid play and blitz. A blitz game usually varies from three to five minutes, so it’s very quick.”\n\nPraise for the chess prodigy has since been pouring in on social media, with leading professionals highlighting her “unbelievable” performance.\n\nBodhana, who began playing aged five, said she was “proud” of her performance. Asked if she gets nervous, she replied: “No, I just play the board.”\n\nRomanian International Master Irina Bulmaga, one of the players Bodhana finished ahead of, wrote on X that it was an “unbelievable result” and added “what a phenomenon she is”.\n\nECF president Dominic Lawson described it as an “extraordinary result for an eight-year-old and something we’ve certainly never seen in this country”.\n\n“She has a remarkably mature playing style, it’s strategic and patient. She has what you might describe as a long game,” he said.\n\nBritish International Master and commentator Lawrence Trent described Bodhana as “one of the greatest talents I’ve witnessed in recent memory”.\n\n“The maturity of her play, her sublime touch, it’s truly breathtaking,” he said. “I have no doubt she will be England’s greatest player and most likely one of the greatest the game has ever seen.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/20ef7ab62e2e56b57189de6f6daddc895be87528565a48b4e705f30eb79edd4d?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

As a child, he never spoke and if he made a sound, it was a mess of words that no one understood.”\n\nBut when the couple introduced Nathanael to books, they realised his ability to read and learn at levels far beyond those expected for his peers.\n\nOn Dec 15, at 13, he became one of the youngest students to graduate from the Australian National University (ANU), earning an honours degree in music composition with a perfect grade point average.\n\nHe also earned a high distinction in his thesis which explored the use of linear algebra to find possible harmonies and test it out.\n\nDespite being surrounded by students twice or thrice his age, Nathanael said he has no problem coping with the academic rigours of university or fitting in with his classmates. “I could think at the same level as them, and we all communicated through our common language of music,” he said.\n\nNathanael started playing piano at three years old but switched to musical theory as per his teacher’s recommendation because his fingers were too weak. He later learned to play the clarinet and saxophone.\n\nAt age nine, he completed his diploma in music theory from Trinity College London. That same year, he became the youngest composer-in-residence at the Singapore’s Kids Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nHis original compositions have since been performed by professional musicians in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Finland.\n\nOn top of his accomplishments in music, Nathanael is a member of high Intelligence Quotient (IQ) society Mensa in Singapore and New Zealand with an IQ of 132.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/599b9e86f3b06cb55a62a2a3ebbd89f05c9f9bf5a4e3724d02dc55622ab28f6f?w=825", "alt_text": "Nathanael Koh became the youngest composer-in-residence at the Singapore’s Kids Philharmonic Orchestra at age nine."}]}

He then borrowed money from friends as he had to support his four children back home as well as his parents who were ill.\n\nEventually, after friends stopped helping him, he turned to HealthServe – a healthcare organisation committed to helping migrant workers – for help with his depression and insomnia. There, Ahmad found a safe space to process his grief and manage his stress.\n\nThrough counselling, he no longer views seeking help as a weakness but as a positive step. He continues to receive support from HealthServe’s casework team who accompany him for hospital visits and provide social assistance and counsel for his WICA (Work Injury Compensation Act) claims.\n\nThis was one of many examples of how HealthServe has lent a hand to Singapore’s one million low-wage migrant workers since its inception in 2006.\n\nOperating out of a clinic in Geylang, HealthServe, which became a charity in 2011, tends to migrant workers with varying health and social needs.\n\n“Our teams lend support to those who may be ill, injured, suffering from dental pain, in mental distress or require some form of social assistance,” said chief executive Benjamin Kuan.\n\n“Patients with workplace injuries form a large proportion of clients. These range from slipped discs to more serious accidents, where some employers may not be supportive of their care and follow-up at the hospitals.”\n\nThe workers pay $5 for each visit, while those on a Special Pass who are unable to work after lodging an injury or salary claim need not pay.\n\nLaunched in 2019, HealthServe’s mental health programme is the first of its kind to support the mental and emotional well-being of the migrant worker community.\n\n“Often, low-wage migrant workers struggle with various mental health issues, and have limited avenues to seek help,” said Dr Kuan.\n\nHealthServe said it works closely with hospitals and dormitories to address and strengthen workers’ mental health via a three-pronged approach, which includes a 24-hour helpline (+65 3129 5000), counselling and group support sessions, and mental health education workshops.\n\nThis year alone, said Dr Kuan, at least 1 in 10 workers referred to HealthServe presented serious risk of self-harm.\n\n“That’s a very worrying observation and signals the need for more to be done in the mental health space.”\n\nAs a lean charity, HealthServe’s work to meet migrant workers’ healthcare needs is underpinned by a pool of about 800 medical and non-medical volunteers, who range from pharmacists and dental assistants to helpline volunteers and translators.\n\n“We’re always on the lookout for like-minded and passionate volunteers to support our clinic operations or regular health outreach, especially those who can speak Tamil, Bengali, Hindi, Burmese or Thai,” Dr Kuan said.\n\nInterested individuals can visit https://healthserve.org.sg/volunteer", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/47b1ce6c4174b0cc3e23507a67f87395ab25e8339dcfac88731ca480c3dc690e?w=825", "alt_text": "A HealthServe staff member attending to the needs of a migrant worker."}]}

Jegatheesan, a Tamil teacher at Raffles Institution (RI), decided to impart some of the knowledge he gained to his students.\n\nHe soon realised that the boys had taken a liking to the Tamil frame drum.\n\nThey not only diligently studied the playing technique, but also the history attached to the somewhat lost art form.\n\nEarlier this year, he got RI alumni Ashwinii Selvaraj, who had learnt to play the parai during a course at the arts school Makoolam Kalai Koodam in Singapore, to teach the boys in detail. And they did a successful performance at the school’s Teachers’ Day celebrations in September.\n\n“I embarked on the trip with the sole intention of immersing myself into the realm of folk arts,” Dr Jegatheesan told tabla! “Little did I know that imparting my newfound knowledge to my students would have such a profound impact on them.”\n\nHe was piqued with learning the parai after his son went to India to master the basics of Parayaatam, a special type of dance where performers beat the parai and dance to its rhythms, as well as other Tamil art forms such as Oyilattam (dance) and Silambam (martial arts).\n\nThe Tamil teacher then embarked on a trip of his own to Madurai in Tamil Nadu to learn the parai over three weeks.\n\nMs Ashwinii, 25, who was impressed with the RI boys’ performance, said: “It’s crucial for young people to acquaint themselves with folk arts.\n\n“Young parents should actively instil an appreciation for these arts in their children. Preserving our culture begins with them.\n\n“If they can enrol their children in activities like swimming, why not consider doing the same for Indian folk arts? Besides cultural preservation, it also contributes towards their overall development.”\n\nAdharsh Srinivasan, 17, one of the student-performers, agreed that learning about the traditional arts keeps Indian youths connected to their roots.\n\n“It also provides us with a sense of identity,” he said. “It’s essential for young people to gain such experiences (learning and performing). Only then can they truly understand the beauty of these art forms and appreciate their significance.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7dc3c60fad4de654dae96150913c4961dcd05c62cd349c96d4682a68d4ae0db0?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

AMBIGA\n\nAli Kasim\n\nIn a house in Poes Garden, Chennai, an ardent Rajinikanth fan from Singapore watches as her idol saunters into the living room wearing a warm, fatherly smile.\n\n“Ambiga,” the 73-year-old actor addresses her in his deep, baritone voice.\n\nMs K.S. Ambiga, 41, laughs giddily in her wheelchair before greeting him with “Thalaiva” (“leader” in Tamil) and embracing him.\n\n“So sweet, kanna,” Rajinikanth replies. They chat for 30 minutes during the unplanned meeting on Dec 16, the topic centering on Ms Ambiga’s decade-long battle with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nShe tells Rajinikanth, one of the most iconic movie stars in Indian cinema over the past 50 years and who has a cult following across South India, that she credits her resilience against MS to him.\n\nThe former counsellor is no ordinary fan. And she has a book to prove it.\n\nHer recently published memoir, The Rajini In Me, was launched amid fanfare in Chennai on Dec 14. The 280-page book chronicles her battle with MS and how she embraced “the essence of Rajinism”, incorporating his philosophy and principles into her own life, and in turn becoming a beacon of inspiration to her peers.\n\n“I was told that Thalaiva was aware of the book, and there would be a chance to meet him. I did not, however, expect it to be within such a short time,” she told tabla!\n\nFriends in Singapore as well as cinema industry insiders who attended the book launch helped secure the meeting between the two.\n\nFormerly a child artiste, Ambiga featured in local Tamil variety programmes such as Chinna Kannmanigal and Chikku Mangu in the 1980s and 90s. Later, while pursuing her passion in bharatanatyam, she became a counsellor to drug offenders at the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association.\n\nHer life took a sharp turn in 2013, when she learnt she had MS, a chronic neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system. When progressively worsened over time, the condition results in multiple disabilities.\n\nIronically, doctors broke the news to her on Rajinikanth’s birthday – Dec 12. That very day, she watched the actor on TV give an acceptance speech for being one of the “25 Living Legends of India”.\n\n“Miracles do happen. An ordinary bus conductor is a living legend,” the actor had said.\n\n“Those words created a profound impact on me,” said Ms Ambiga.\n\nIn 2022, she underwent a stem-cell transplant, followed by chemotherapy. While quarantined for six months, she received a voice note from Rajinikanth – through her celebrity friends Hayma Malini and Yugendran Vasudevan – wishing her a speedy recovery.\n\n“He spoke my name and conveyed his heartfelt wishes for my wellness… On that day, when I was feeling unwell and low, his message boosted my confidence unlike anything I ever experienced,” Ms Ambiga said.\n\n“I was inspired to introspect and analyse myself to see what I can do to make the most out of my situation as a disabled person,” she added.\n\nMs Ambiga hopes her book will provide readers the impetus to find their own wellspring of motivation – or as she puts it: “Their own Rajini”.\n\n“Even I am still finding my Rajini”, the actor told her during their meeting, as he handed her a set of rosary beads.\n\n“His message boosted my confidence unlike anything \nI ever experienced.”\n\nK.S.

They do not eat Indian food regularly. It’s just me, the unique one,” he told tabla!\n\nWhen he was 18, he began learning to make pasta dishes and eggs benedict. Over time, he honed his cooking skills through YouTube clips and cookbooks.\n\nIn 2021, Cheong, an engineering student at the time, felt he was ready to test himself against the best when he signed up for MasterChef. During one of the rounds, he prepared Indian dishes for the judges.\n\n“I made kulfi, the frozen Indian dessert, during one of the rounds,” he said. For the final, I made a prawn appetiser, a duck main course and a dessert with pineapples.”\n\nAfter winning the competition, Cheong dropped out of Nanyang Technological University to pursue a culinary career. Now a familiar face in the food and beverage scene, he was soon approached with a business opportunity.\n\nHe was dining at a pizza restaurant when Mr Kelvin Sia, the regional CEO of GoPizza – a famous Korean pizza chain – recognised him.\n\n“He struck up a conversation with me and asked if I wanted to become a GoPizza franchisee,” Cheong said.\n\n“I wasn’t too interested at first, as I always saw myself as a fine dining chef. But when opportunity knocks at your door, you might as well take it up, right?”\n\nCheong took a leap of faith, and set up a GoPizza stall at Pasir Ris Hawker Centre in March this year.\n\nThe stall, however, began to feature pizzas with an Indian twist.\n\n“Instead of the usual pepperoni pizza, I went for chicken tikka pizza, palak paneer pizza, butter chicken pizza, etc. These are now the signature menu items,” said Cheong, who is helped occasionally at the stall by his father Ernest.\n\nThere’s also a kofta pizza and mushroom masala pizza on offer, along with sides like chicken 65, mushroom pakoda and Madras curry wings.\n\n“When people ask me why Indian flavours for pizza, I would say it’s because I love Indian food. I don’t see any other chefs doing this, and I am happy to say that my stall is the only place you can find such dishes in Singapore,” he said.\n\nTo cater to the traditionalists, there are also options such as ham and cheddar pizza and “Four Cheese Maniac” on the menu.\n\n“I get a mix of both Indian and Chinese customers. It motivates me to be more creative, and this can take my dishes to the next level,” Cheong said.\n\nOne of his customers, Beth, 31, who works in the education sector, said: “It’s my first time trying GoPizza and Derek nailed the dish. The Indian spices actually go well with the pizza.”\n\nAnother customer Paramasivam, 53, who is self-employed, said: “As an Indian, I need my spices for sure. The chicken tikka pizza is so nice. There is a right balance of spice and flavour to it.”\n\nAside from helming the pizza joint, Cheong also has his fingers in other pies.\n\n“I’ve launched an artisanal chocolate brand where chocolates are made using fungi and vegetables. I am currently a private F&B consultant as well,” he said.\n\nNext up, he plans to serve rice bowls.\n\n“I’m planning to open a stall at Singapore Polytechnic that sells modern rice bowls,” said Cheong. “I have an undying thirst for knowledge, so I am continuously looking to expand my business and do something new every time.”.\n\n“When people ask me why Indian flavours for pizza, \nI would say it’s because I love Indian food. I don’t see any other chefs doing this.”\n\nMasterChef winner Derek Cheong who\n runs a stall serving Indian-flavoured pizzas.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fe7572ead27515572a6f7f5485e8108c05769cbe1ef062116a3903fb4de68d1e?w=825", "alt_text": "Derek Cheong at his GoPizza stall in Pasir Ris."}]}

We have lights", "publish_date": null, "content": "News\n\nNo snow on Christmas? We have lights\n\nUPDATED\n\nDec 22, 2023, 5:30 AM\n\nOrchard Road’s annual Christmas On A Great Street Light-Up.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nAli Kasim\n\nALI KASIM\n\nThe year was 1988, I was seven years old, and an argument broke out inside my dad’s Toyota Cressida.\n\nWhile travelling along Orchard Road, I was adamant that CK Tangs – decorated in green with a reindeer-pulled sled lodged on the mall’s facade – was the best decorated building along the stretch. My elder sister trumped for Centrepoint, which went for the snow motif – completely “decked” in white with cardboard ice caps melting off the rooftop. She would bet on Centrepoint every year; it was her favourite mall.\n\nOne year, in the late ’80s or early ’90s, Centrepoint pulled out all the stops, having lost the Best Dressed Building contest – perhaps rather controversially – the year before. The mall, which anyone above the age of 35 might remember was once the cornerstone of Orchard Road shopping, spared no expense on cosmetically enhancing its facade and exterior.\n\nIt had elaborate lights, tons of styrofoam snow, even Santa; in its redemption year, it looked by far the best “Christmas mall”.\n\nThree decades ago, there was nothing quite like a walk – or ride – down a decked-up Orchard Road to get into the Christmas mood in Singapore. Orchard Road used to be “the” place to go. And predicting the Best Dressed Mall was an annual bet among my family, even if there were no real stakes involved.\n\nChristmas lights in Orchard Road debuted in the early 1980s. Back then, it was a relatively simple affair with 100,000 light bulbs adorning the 3.1km stretch. On Christmas Eve during the early years, the size of the crowd on the streets reportedly numbered 30,000 on average. If you wanted to drive and see the lights along Orchard Road on Christmas Eve, you would get stuck in a jam akin to the Causeway.\n\nThe official contest seems to have been discontinued in recent years, but you couldn’t really tell.\n\nChristmas On A Great Street, this year’s signature light-up heralding the holiday season, will mark the 40th anniversary of the annual light-up along the famous shopping belt.\n\nOrnate Christmas trees decorated with reindeer figures and baubles line the walkway outside ION Orchard, amid a cotton-candy cloud dreamscape – the design motif this time around. If there was a contest this year, ION would be heavy favourites.\n\nModern technology has rendered mere light bulbs as “basic”. Now it’s about augmented reality (AR) projection. On the facade of the Hilton Orchard, all 25 glass panels lining the pedestrian walkway from Ion Orchard to Mandarin Gallery feature AR displays.\n\nIt makes you wonder – if we didn’t light up Singapore’s “Main Street”, would we miss Christmas?\n\nWithout a winter season (or any other season except humid, for that matter) or snowfall, would Dec 25 look – and feel – like June 12?\n\nAnd why the predilection for light-ups? We do it in Little India during Deepavali, Chinatown for Chinese New Year, and Geylang for Hari Raya Aidilfitri. Lights, lights, and LED lights.\n\nHello, this is Christmas. We’re calling to say we’ll be putting up lights.\n\nHaving once lived in Toronto, Canada, you knew Christmas was at the doorstep because you’d be shovelling snow off of it two months ahead. Days were shorter, you wouldn’t dream of leaving your coats at home, and traffic slowed because of ice on the road.\n\nThere was no need for extra lights along the shopping district. The Yuletide season was really more about family, eggnog and stockings by the fireplace (some folks just lap up the cliches). For the less inclined, it meant a quick getaway to Cancun in Mexico.\n\nFor Jessalyn Fajardo, a domestic worker from the Philippines, the absence of lavish decor and lights at Lucky Plaza mall, didn’t go unnoticed. She frequents the mall every Sunday, like several other domestic workers,\n\n“All the other malls are so well decorated. I’m wondering why not Lucky Plaza?”, she asked. “We won’t be home for our Christmas, so it would be nice to be reminded of the holiday season while we’re here.”\n\nAt Tanglin Mall, on the outskirts of the “lit-up malls” perimeter, a “Snow Splendour” event, with the help of snow machines, has been ongoing. You know, to make things more “Christmassy”.\n\nYou won’t need a shovel or a coat to attend, though.\n\nIf we didn’t light up the “Main Street” of Singapore, would we miss Christmas? Without a winter season or snowfall, would Dec 25 look – and feel – like June 12?", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7a336cd474107efcc80b45806f72c84478cd161a3df24c22c128df3953721549?w=825", "alt_text": "Orchard Road’s annual Christmas On A Great Street Light-Up."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSam Bahadur – the movie – tracks the career of a highly decorated army officer who served India during critical times.\n\nThe officer is none other than Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. He acquired the name Sam Bahadur or “Sam the Brave” from a soldier who was unable to pronounce the officer’s last name and came up with an alternative.\n\nBorn in British India, Sam joined the army and fought against Japan in World War II. He was severely wounded and received the Military Cross for his bravery.\n\nWhile charting his illustrious career, the film offers several revelations. Perhaps the most noteworthy was the budding friendship between Sam and Major Yahya Khan.\n\nUpon India’s partition in 1947, Yahya went over to Pakistan’s new army, but Sam refused to budge.\n\nYahya later became Pakistan’s president and Sam’s foe in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War. Sam was then the Indian army’s chief of staff.\n\nSam’s achievements earned him the rank of field marshal – the first for an Indian officer – in 1973, just as he was about to retire.\n\nHe was, at heart, a soldiers’ officer, ever concerned about his subordinates’ welfare.\n\nIn the movie, he comes upon a junior officer ordering a soldier to do 1,000 salutes as the latter had failed to salute the officer.\n\nWhile agreeing that such discipline is necessary, Sam says it is army custom that every salute has to be returned with a salute. This is perhaps to teach the officer that actions have repercussions. Sam then walks away with a slight smile, leaving the soldier and officer saluting each other.\n\nThe film also features decades-old documentary footage, some of which depict Sam’s interactions with various Indian leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Krishna Menon.\n\nWhile effectively portraying the chemistry between Sam and former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and their ability to respect each other’s opinions, Sam’s disdain for self-serving politicians is obvious.\n\nAs Sam’s wife, Sanya Malhotra does well to convey her simmering jealousy over her husband’s interactions with Ms Gandhi.\n\nFrom start to finish, Vicky Kaushal plays Sam to perfection.

Jaishankar in New Delhi.\n\nREUTERS\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has, for the first time, responded to allegations of an Indian assassination plot in the United States, saying he will “look into” any evidence, but a “few incidents” would not derail US-India ties.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, he said: “If someone gives us any information, we would definitely look into it. If a citizen of ours has done anything good or bad, we are ready to look into it. Our commitment is to the rule of law.”\n\nThe US recently accused India of a plot to assassinate its citizen and the general counsel for the separatist group Sikhs for Justice Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. India has labelled Mr Pannun a terrorist.\n\nExpressing deep concern over the activities of certain extremist groups based overseas, Mr Modi told the financial daily: “These elements, under the guise of freedom of expression, have engaged in intimidation and incited violence.\n\n“Security and counter-terrorism co-operation has been a key component of our partnership (with the US). I don’t think it’s appropriate to link a few incidents with diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\n“We need to accept the fact that we are living in an era of multilateralism. The world is interconnected as well as interdependent. This reality compels us to recognise that absolute agreement on all matters cannot be a prerequisite for collaboration.”\n\nLast month, the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment that implicated an Indian government official for orchestrating the plot to assassinate Mr Pannun in June this year through Indian national Nikhil Gupta, who hired a hitman – an undercover agent for US law enforcement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said India’s ties with Canada may have undergone “a tonal shift” following the indictment of Gupta, who has been arrested in the Czech Republic.\n\n“I think there is a beginning of an understanding that they can’t bluster their way through this, and there is an openness to collaborating in a way that perhaps they were less open to before,” Mr Trudeau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nHe said the US indictment appears to have convinced the Indian government to adopt a more sober tone.\n\n“There’s an understanding that maybe just churning out attacks against Canada isn’t going to make this problem go away,” he said. “We don’t want to be in a situation of having a fight with India right now over this.\n\n“We want to be working on that trade deal. We want to be advancing the Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\n“But it is foundational for Canada to stand up for people’s rights, for people’s safety, and for the rule of law. And that’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Mr Trudeau’s allegations on Sept 18 of a “potential” involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on June 18 in British Columbia.\n\nIndia had designated Nijjar a terrorist in 2020.\n\nIndia rejected Mr Trudeau’s allegations as “absurd” and “motivated”.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8fc977969ffb23bbb932a4451bbbd2b611f1482e01d9b3ff898311d5d961df0a?w=825", "alt_text": "India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi with External Affairs Minister S.

Santosh Kumar\n\nBobby Deol as antagonist Abrar Haque in the Sandeep Reddy Vanga directorial Animal is trending big on social media – and for all the right reasons.\n\nOne particular scene, of Bobby’s entry in the film, has the Internet hooked.\n\nIt has Deol dancing to the viral song Jamal Kudu with a glass of alcohol on his head.\n\nAfter T-Series released the full video of the two-minute song on Dec 7, it garnered more than 1.9 million views in just three hours.\n\nToday, it is a huge hit among people in India, with millions dancing to the tunes at parties and copying and re-interpreting the moves in videos and posting them on social media.\n\nThe song has garnered more than 52 million views on YouTube as of Dec 21.\n\nOriginally composed by Iran’s Khatareh Group, Jamal Jamaloo Kudu was first sung by the choir of Kharazemi Girls’ High School in the 1950s. The song is an adaption of a poem written by Iranian poet Bijan Samandar.\n\nComposer Harshavardhan Rameshwar reworked and remixed the song for Animal, giving it a new chorus.\n\nThe hook line “Jamal Jamalek Jamaloo Jamal Kudu” means “Oh my love, my beloved, my sweet love!”\n\n“I experienced it in the theatre and believe me, no other scene from Animal created that much cheer and craziness,” wrote one person on YouTube.\n\nAnother said: “Bobby Deol deserves heartfelt appreciation for his ability to command attention and make every second count. With minimal screen time, he manages to leave an indelible mark through his nuanced expressions and compelling portrayal.”\n\nThe actor told Bollywood Spy how he got the idea of using a glass while dancing.\n\n“It’s crazy, people are placing a glass on their dog’s head and dancing. Somebody wore the same suit as mine. It’s just overwhelming to see all of that.\n\n“(Vanga) made me listen to the music. He found the song from somewhere and told me, ‘I will play this in your introduction’.\n\n“When we started shooting, the choreographer said, ‘You do it’. I was like, ‘What will I do?’ I started dancing, and he told me, ‘No, No. Don’t do it like Bobby Deol’.\n\n“Then I suddenly remembered the time when I was small, and we used to go to Punjab. I remembered how we used to get drunk and keep glasses on our heads. I never understood why we did it. It suddenly came to my mind and I did that. Sandeep liked it.”\n\nThe girl featured in the song, Iranian model and dancer Tannaz Davoodi, too has become an instant sensation.\n\nBorn in Tehran, the 26-year-old pursued a fashion design course, before becoming a Bollywood dancer. Her previous appearances in Hindi films were often in the background.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3d197df6b1f3f9430b2e12d80f0558d02c76c9e97fdf20e119029aa289490700?w=825", "alt_text": "Bobby Deol in a still from the Animal song Jamal Kudu."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTankeeb Akhtar was choked with emotion on Tuesday when Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals engaged in an intense bidding war for his nephew Sameer Rizvi (right), a 20-year-old batter from Uttar Pradesh, at the Indian Premier league (IPL) auction in Dubai.\n\nThe bid settled at a whopping Rs8.40 crore ($1.3 million), with the young cricketer going to Chennai for IPL 2024.\n\nIt was an unparalleled moment for both Akhtar and Sameer, as the latter became the most expensive uncapped player at the auction.\n\nIt also came after massive struggles for the family, as Sameer’s father Haseen has not been able to work owing to poor health.\n\n“We were expecting Sameer to get picked by some team in the auction. But we never expected this big money or CSK to bid for him,” Akhtar told the Press Trust of India.\n\n“Now we are looking ahead to a brighter future.\n\n“Sameer has a lot of ambitions – buying a good house, proper treatment for his father, and a lot of things like that. With Allah’s blessings, he can meet all of that.\n\n“Sameer is also thrilled that he can finally meet (CSK captain and Indian legend) M.S. Dhoni from close quarters and share space with him.”\n\nSameer said he is excited about the chance to play for CSK, but admitted he was nervous when his name came up in the auction.\n\n“I noticed that five players before me went unsold. I was nervous at that time,” he told Jio Cinema. “But he (Dhoni) has always been my idol. I am very excited, yet nervous about the prospect of meeting him. I have never seen him in front of my eyes.”\n\nSo what prompted CSK and other teams to go on a bidding war for this Uttar Pradesh lad?\n\nSameer caught the eyes of IPL talent scouts during the UP T20 League while playing for Kanpur Super Stars.\n\nHe hammered 455 runs from nine matches, including the fastest hundred in the tournament off 47 balls.\n\nThe lad carried that form into the state Under-23 tournament where he smashed 454 runs from seven matches.\n\nBut, more than those runs, it was Sameer’s ability to clear the ropes by several metres that fascinated the scouts. The young batter smoked 72 sixes across 16 matches in those tournaments.\n\n“It is his natural game. He has been a big-hitter from a young age. He has interacted and played with seasoned players like Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh (in UP T20 League) and they have also told him to play his natural game. It helped him a lot,” said Akhtar, who is Sameer’s coach and mentor.\n\n“He’s living my dream. I knew he was a big hitter, and he showed promise from the time he was six. In 15 years, we did not take an off for even 15 days. It’s sheer hard work that has got him here.”\n\nSameer was sceptical of getting an IPL contract once he missed trials with a few teams because of his state commitments.\n\n“I told him don’t worry, the opportunity will come to you. You keep performing on the field. SG (Sanspareils Greenlands, the cricket gear manufacturer) helped him a lot through sponsorship of equipment,” said Akhtar.\n\nHe doesn’t want his nephew to just make waves donning CSK’s “Canary Yellow” but to realise his ultimate goal of wearing the “India Blue”.\n\n“We are happy our efforts have borne fruits, and finally (an IPL contract) has come his way. There are tears in the eyes of everyone at home. Hopefully, he will go and play for India one day,” said Akhtar.\n\nThe elation among the entire family was palpable.\n\nHaseen, a property dealer, said: “I am speechless. What else can a father ask for? I am the happiest man on the planet.\n\n“I used to thrash him for not studying, and even rebuked my brother-in-law Tankeeb for distracting him from his studies. It’s only now he managed to clear his Class 10 exams, but that doesn’t matter anymore. God’s will prevails in the end.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“I am speechless. What else can a father ask for?

Just a few metres away, a green parrot named Letchumi was about to tell the fate and fortunes of a European tourist.\n\nParrot astrology is a rare sight these days, and part-time astrologer Selvaraju Muniyandi, 53, had been called in as a special segment of the festival. Lovingly urging Letchumi – his sidekick for the last 20 years – out of her cage, he politely asked her to pick, using her orange beak, a fortune card from a deck of 27.\n\nEach fortune card depicts a Hindu deity, with an accompanying message addressing the cosmic influence it bears on a customer’s current state of affairs.\n\n“I’m usually sceptical about fortune-telling, but I was surprised when Letchumi picked up a card for me, and I saw my favourite god’s picture,” said Mr Thennavan Aandiyappan, 37.\n\nWay to go, Letchumi. Converting a non-believer is always a feat.\n\nSpeaking of feats, it apparently takes a high level of skill to flip a prata in the air. The larger the dough, the easier it tears – as the amateur contestants among the crowd soon found out. They were vying for a spot in the final of a competition that also aimed to enter the Singapore Book of Records for the “Largest Prata Flip”.\n\nIn the end, the experts from Casuarina Curry showed everyone how it’s done. Three chefs from the popular chain – each from a different branch – earned a spot on the podium. A 1-2-3 sweep. Evidently, they take prata-making quite seriously at Casuarina.\n\nRemarkably, Casuarina’s chef from Myanmar – Cho Wai Lwin, 39 – bagged the first prize and $1,000 cash. She flipped a 80gm prata dough which was 61cm in length.\n\n“I remember how hard it was for me to learn prata flipping, and now I am standing tall and proud as the winner,” said Cho, who learnt the technique from her father when she was 12 years old.\n\nA prata aficionado from Myanmar. Do they even have prata joints in Yangon? Surely not even Letchumi could’ve predicted this.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c2ba4f7c13fc0936ee160b2c21d8d15aa003b438573861c7527fbf9e5bfde839?w=825", "alt_text": "Casuarina Curry’s Cho Wai Lwin, a chef from Myanmar, won the Prata Flip competition at the Great Indian Food Festival on Sunday, where fortune-telling parrot Letchumi also received some attention."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Madras High Court has slammed actor Mansoor Ali Khan (right) for seeking Rs1 crore each in compensation from South Indian stars Trisha Krishnan, Chiranjeevi and Khushbu Sundar.\n\nThe actor alleged that the trio had made defamatory statements against him in public without verifying his statement on Trisha.\n\nThe plea came up for hearing on Monday and the actor was pulled up.\n\nJustice N. Sathish Kumar wondered why Khan was the one filing defamation suits instead of Trisha.\n\n“Did he tender the unconditional apology only to escape arrest? Actually, Trisha should have moved the suit for damage. On what basis has he moved it?” the court questioned, requesting Khan’s counsel to advise him on how to act responsibly in public.\n\nThe judge also directed Trisha, Chiranjeevi and Khushbu to respond to the suit.\n\nLast month, Khan found himself in the centre of a controversy after he made derogatory and misogynistic comments against his Leo co-actor Trisha.\n\nAfter the actress protested and many others denounced his comments, the police questioned Khan. Later, he apologised to Trisha for what he said.\n\nBut, when everyone thought the matter was settled, Khan filed a defamation case against Trisha, Telugu megastar Chiranjeevi and actress-turned-politician Khushbu for calling him out.\n\nKhan claimed he did not utter anything wrong against any person.\n\nHis petition read that he was merely commenting on the negative shades he had played in the past and how certain scenes he had done are no longer the norm.\n\nHe reiterated that no personal comments were made against Trisha or any woman in his statement.\n\nThe judge, however, criticised Khan for constantly landing himself in controversies.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c2db110d86cb4e01b947b3fc5291265ca6ceeaa1c086049b86a772448f43afe2?w=825", "alt_text": "Tamil actor Mansoor Ali Khan."}]}

Besides cash, the tax officers also recovered 3kg of gold ornaments.\n\nThe previous highest record of cash recovery was from a Kanpur-based businessman amounting to Rs257 crore in 2019. A year earlier, the department seized Rs163 crore from a person in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDuring the operations, the tax department carried out searches at Sahu’s office premises in Ranchi, Jharkhand, and other places. The raids were conducted on charges of tax evasion and “off-the-book” transactions.\n\nThe counting involved nine teams of about 80 people from the tax department and various banks, working in shifts around the clock. There were 176 bags of cash, and three banks were roped in for the counting, which used 40 currency counting machines, The Hindustan Times reported.\n\nThe paper also said that, soon after the counting started, the currency counting machines “gave in” due to the huge amounts of cash, and more had to be brought in.\n\nAnother team of 200 officials, including security personnel, drivers and other staff joined in, after tax officials found 10 cupboards stuffed with cash at some locations.\n\nIndia Today reported that some 200 bags and trunks were used to transport the Rs351 crore, which has been deposited in the tax department’s bank account in Odisha.\n\nThe money will remain there until the probe agency goes through all the papers and decides how much of the seized cash is illegal.\n\nThe tax department will soon summon the main promoters of the company and record their statements.\n\nAs the buzz over the raids spread, on X, an old post by Sahu went viral.\n\nWriting about black money in the nation, he said last year: “I feel pained seeing so much corruption and black money in the country even after demonetisation. This is beyond my understanding how people can accumulate so much black money. Only Congress can uproot corruption from the country.”\n\nSharing a screenshot of the tweet which went viral, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya made a satirical post on X. “Dhiraj Prasad Sahu has a dark sense of humour,” he said.\n\nThe BJP also questioned Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s silence over the matter.\n\nBJP chief J.P. Nadda took to X and wrote: “Brother, both you and your leader Rahul Gandhi will have to answer. This is the new India, here people will not be allowed to be exploited in the name of the royal family. You will get tired running, but the law will not leave you. If Congress is the guarantee of corruption then Modi ji is the guarantee of action against corruption, every penny looted from the public will have to be returned.”\n\nThe Congress said that it is in no way connected with Sahu’s businesses, and the MP from Jharkhand should explain the matter.\n\nTaking to X, the Congress general-secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said: “The Indian National Congress is in no way connected with the businesses of Dheeraj Sahu, MP.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nSchoolboy Arunesh Siva Prabu, who has been playing football for three years, had a dream come true last month.\n\nThe 11-year-old got to train for a week at Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund with 11 other children between ages 11 and 14 from Singapore.\n\nThey were taken to the German city as part of FootballPlus academy’s Champions Unlimited programme, which gives a chance to children from low-income, single-parent households to excel in football.\n\nThe trip was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Singapore, which donated $200,000 to the programme.\n\n“I have always loved football,” said Arunesh, a Cedar Primary student. “Joining FootballPlus has helped me become a better defender. I play for my school team, but my goal is to play football at a higher level for a club.”\n\nThirty children, including girls, are part of FootballPlus’ Champions Unlimited programme. Arunesh was selected because he is disciplined, focused and determined to improve his skills, said coach Ho Wen Jin, who also plays for Tiong Bahru in the Women’s Premier League.\n\n“We assessed their progress over a period and then the coaches got together and selected the ones deserving to go on the trip,” she said. “Our programme includes support for the children’s school education too.”\n\nIn Dortmund last month, the weather was just turning cold, but it was not much of a bother for Arunesh.\n\n“We got up early in the morning to train,” he said. “The coaches taught us several tricks, and we also got to play with the local boys. It was fun, but at the same time we had to be disciplined.”\n\nThe group from Singapore, including coaches and support staff, were put up in a hotel near the Dortmund academy. They were provided nutritious food and got to travel in the bus that the club uses to ferry their top players.\n\n“Rotary’s aim was to reward high-performing underprivileged kids with a stint at Dortmund,” said Mr Tom Wolf, president-elect of Rotary Club and a German entrepreneur who lives in Singapore.\n\n“Such an experience can change their lives. It is a huge step in their overall development. A trip to a foreign country is an eye-opener, and they get to learn so many new things which are beneficial.\n\n“Importantly, they got a feel of how football is played at the highest level and what has to be done to reach the top. They also got to play in an informal local league where people from the lower strata of society form teams to play on the streets.”\n\nThe Rotary Club’s big project this year was to help develop youth football in Singapore, and Mr Wolf used his German connections to strike a deal with Dortmund, which has a training academy in Singapore.\n\nRotary also built two 7-a-side pitches at FootballPlus’ academy in MacPherson.\n\nTowards the football project, Rotary Club channelled $500,000 to FootballPlus in total, out of which the Singapore government contributed $250,000 and corporates $100,000.\n\nMr Wolf said that he and his team were initially concerned whether the children, most of whom were on their first trip overseas, could handle the conditions in Germany.\n\n“They didn’t feel the cold (too much), so there were more things for them to do,” he said. “Nobody was homesick too, despite being so far away from home and in such a different culture. In fact, they came to me and said they wanted to stay longer.”\n\nBuoyed by the children’s experience, the Rotary Club is toying with the idea of taking its youth football development project to the next level.\n\n“We are discussing the possibility of providing this overseas training opportunity to an older age group,” said Mr Wolf. “We hope we can offer them at least two weeks’ stay in an academy like Dortmund’s.”\n\n“They got a feel of how football is played at the highest level and what has to be done to reach the top”\n\nMr Tom Wolf, president-elect of Rotary Club of Singapore, who helped organise the stint.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bfafadbeb01557d862b570fa433cc2ad9a78113c7fa11fb404984fa93f8b35eb?w=825", "alt_text": "Arunesh Siva Prabu (left) training at the Borussia Dortmund academy."}]}

The club acquired land on Balestier Plain for use as an open playing field.\n\nWhile moving its premises from Short Street to Owen Road and then to Race Course Road, it raised funds to build a clubhouse in Balestier Road; its foundation stone was laid by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru on June 17, 1950. His daughter Indira Gandhi, who later became India’s prime minister, was also present.\n\nOn July 21, 1951, the clubhouse was officially declared open by Commissioner-General of South-east Asia Malcolm MacDonald. It continues to be the centre of IA’s activities after a few rounds of refurbishments.\n\nHowever, the efforts to establish IA as the premier Indian organisation in Singapore gradually began to wither in the 1970s and 80s, as it was unable to connect with the new generation of Indians, and failed to attract most of the professionals in the community.\n\nIn 1988, when a new management committee took over, its finances were greatly depleted, and its membership was at an all-time low of 300.\n\nThe committee used sporting activities such as hockey, cricket, darts, billiards and tennis to raise the number of members to more than 1,000. The return of social events and an active women’s wing also enlivened the association.\n\nIA, which has produced several sportspersons of national calibre since the 1950s, continued to produce more, especially in cricket and hockey.\n\nBut then it again experienced a decline in the early 2000s, when infighting and poor management made many Indians hesitant to join the organisation.\n\n“When I took over as president in 2011, the clubhouse was in a dilapidated condition,” said former ambassador K. Kesavapany, who was at the helm for eight years. “I, along with a few others such as Haider Sithawalla, Shabbir Hassanbhai, Prof Kamal Bose, Eddie Raj and V.P. Jothi, raised more than $500,000 and got the association going again. It was tough, but we stood on the shoulders of those who went before us to lift the fortunes of IA.”\n\nIn 2022, IA went through another upheaval, before a young committee led by Mr Tamil Marren, a former national footballer, stepped up to run it.\n\n“Your history has not been without challenges, but each time the leadership managed to revive the association, rebuild support from members and embark on a promising path,” said Mr Tharman. “The histories most worth remembering and reminiscing over are those that involved difficulties, not just those where everything went swimmingly well.”\n\nHe acknowledged the contributions of several past leaders including Mr S.A. Nathan, Mr S.S. Dhillon, Mr Leslie Netto, Mr Eddie and Mr Kesavapany, and the role played by IA in grooming sportspersons who went on represent the nation.\n\nAt the gala dinner, the likes of Shanti Pereira and Maimoon Abu Bakar (athletics), Imran Khwaja (cricket), M. Jeevananthan (hockey) and R. Suria Murthi (football) were honoured with scrolls and mementos.\n\n“IA was of course not just about sports,” said Mr Tharman. “The bonds you have built among your patrons and your members are really what has kept the association going. It explains how we’ve come to 100 years.”\n\nIn his speech, IA president Marren said: “The challenges and adversities have come and been faced bravely. But possibly the next 25, 50, 100 years will be even more challenging for IA to remain relevant to the community and nation.\n\n“The management committee is committed to working harder and coming out on top. We want to take IA forward and our efforts to connect with every level of the community is a work in progress.”\n\nHe identified five areas that require more attention: Community building, sports excellence, cultural activities, sustainable revenue stream and grooming of next-generation leaders.\n\nIn keeping with future goals, a new logo was launched with the letters SGIA prominent.\n\nWhile commending the IA management for thinking about the future, Mr Tharman said: “IA must continue the recovery trajectory in the next few years – consolidating the gains you have made, growing your membership, if possible, but making the association a place where people want to be a member, and they want to meet each other there – that is important.\n\n“I think you have to stay relevant to a changing Singapore because it is going to change dramatically, not just in the next 100 years, but in the next 25 years we will be an older society and we should have activities for the older population.\n\n“Senior citizens who want to remain young at heart, even playing sports, engaging in games and having a fraternity that keeps them going. At the same time, you have the challenge of attracting more young members, (through) sports, music, and other ways. So I encourage you to do that as well.”\n\n“Your history has not been without challenges, but each time the leadership managed to revive the association, rebuild support from members and embark on a promising path.”\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/87fb1c61350f4682193345f71f788713d32b2e4acdf5ef1df18eb1ca1782874c?w=825", "alt_text": "(From left) IA vice-president Parthiban Murugaiyan, IA president Tamil Marren, Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his wife Jane Ittogi and IA vice-president Jayiathi Manian at the Indian Association gala dinner."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAnimal, directed by the provocateur Sandeep Reddy Vanga and starring Ranbir Kapoor, has delivered the biggest second-weekend haul in the history of Hindi-language cinema.\n\nThe film is now less than US$15 million (S$20 million) shy of becoming the third Bollywood release of 2023 to pass the coveted US$100 million mark at the global box office – a rarity for Indian films, even more so in the same calendar year.\n\nThe film was released in Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada on Dec 1.\n\nAnimal, which tracks the hyper-violent story of a vengeful man with severe daddy issues, delivered the second-biggest opening for Bollywood this year, sandwiched between two Shah Rukh Khan blockbusters – Pathaan and Jawan.\n\nAfter 10 days of release, Animal has made Rs770 crore (US$86 million) worldwide. Of this, more than US$50 million has come from India, and more than US$11 million from North American theatres.\n\nAnimal is now the third-biggest overall Indian hit of the year behind Pathaan (US$130 million) and Jawan (US$138 million), both domestically and worldwide.\n\nWhile both those films served as rebound vehicles for objectively the biggest Indian movie star of his generation, Shah Rukh Khan, Animal establishes Ranbir as arguably his true successor.\n\nThe actor has had an uneven post-pandemic run, which began with the disastrous Shamshera, and continued with the modest hit Brahmastra: Part One – Shiva, and the romantic comedy Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar.\n\nHowever, much of Animal’s success can be attributed to Vanga, who, at just three films old, is a brand unto himself.\n\nThe 41-year-old does not always make the right news, though.\n\nWhile each of his movies have been successful at the box office, Animal is the biggest A-rated film – India’s equivalent of the R rating.\n\nThe film has also been criticised for its brazen misogyny and glorification of toxic masculinity. As more people become attuned to the director’s sensibilities, the backlash has become louder.\n\nVenga experienced something similar in 2019, with the film Kabir Singh. Like Animal, that movie defied poor reviews and emerged as one of the biggest Bollywood hits of the year.\n\nAnimal’s record-breaking success has shown that reviews have little influence when the target audience’s endorsement is all that matters.\n\nThe film currently sits at a “rotten” 29 per cent score on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, while it has a much higher audience score of 81 per cent.\n\nAlso starring Rashmika Mandanna, Triptii Dimrri, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol, the film eulogises alpha males and their controversial traits, sparking heated debates on toxic masculinity and the subdued portrayal of women in Vanga’s films.\n\nThrough its action-packed, blood-soaked 204 minutes, Animal seeks to give audiences a thrill while glorifying ruthlessly sexist behaviour by turning chauvinist men into action heroes.\n\nRanbir plays Ranvijay Singh, a character obsessed with his absentee father (Kapoor). He woos Geetanjali (Rashmika) by emphasising traits like hunting prowess and providing for the family. The mention of male genitalia, both in all seriousness and humour, further dilutes the idea of healthy masculinity.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, Ranvijay evolves into a man surrounded by a bunch of alpha males who resort to violence as the ultimate solution to anything that bothers them.\n\nThis uncalled-for dominance and toxic masculinity have triggered a wave of criticism, with audiences and film critics expressing their discontent with the film’s storyline and portrayal of characters. Some hail Ranvijay as a hero, while others condemn him as being violent and animalistic.\n\nPublic figures such as cricketer Jaydev Unadkat and lyricist Swanand Kirkire expressed their disappointment with the movie, calling it pathetic, while noted film critics Anupama Chopra and Bhawana Somaaya labelled it “overtly violent and misogynistic”.\n\nDespite this, Animal continues to thrive at the box office, prompting discussions about the audience’s taste and the broader responsibility of filmmakers.\n\nIndo-Asian News service\n\n“After watching the movie Animal, I really felt pity for the women of today’s generation. Now, a new man has been prepared for you, who is more scary, who does not respect you that much and who aims to subdue you, suppress you and feels proud of himself... I have come home desperate, dejected and weak!”\n\nLyricist, writer and actor Swanand Kirkire", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/843c6308451fe600177b00b09b5c6bc5d1bf2a952aa9aa33a05a930e18bea535?w=825", "alt_text": "Ranbir Kapoor in the film Animal"}]}

JANARTHANAN\n\nLooking back at 17 years on the front lines of fire rescue operations, one incident stands out for Singapore Civil Defence Force officer, Captain Gangadevi Rountan.\n\nIn 2007, the 37-year-old was responding to a fire in a Yishun flat, where a mother and her five-year-old daughter were trapped in different parts of the home.\n\n“I could clearly hear the mother screaming for us to save her daughter when she heard us calling out for survivors. My team then searched for the girl while others went towards the voice of the mother,” she said.\n\nCapt Ganga soon found the terrified girl hugging a sink tightly and crying.\n\n“When I held out my hand, she was too terrified to move towards me. I had to coax her out of the spot.”\n\nAfter pulling her to safety, Capt Ganga comforted the little girl and calmed her down. She witnessed later on the child being reunited with her mother in an embrace – a scene Capt Ganga described as “unforgettable”.\n\nThat episode, she said, highlighted the intensity of emotions sometimes involved in firefighting and rescue operations. And, when she relayed such stories to her family and friends, they gradually understood why she chose such a “risky” profession.\n\nGrowing up, Ms Ganga was “the most playful child” among three children.\n\n“I was not a very obedient or studious person. Sports was always my escape, but my parents, like many other parents, often nagged me to pay attention to my studies,” she said.\n\nHer parents did not completely discourage her from partaking in sports, however. While in Primary 6, Capt Ganga was recruited by a local football club to be part of its girls’ team. At 13, she was selected for the national Under-18 side.\n\nLater, Capt Ganga attained a diploma in sports and wellness management, all the while keeping up with her extra-curricular activities, which included dance and volunteering with various community service programmes.\n\nThese programmes, she said, inspired her to look for a career that entailed helping others.\n\n“My mother also advised me that, given my personality, I should look for a job that was not ‘deskbound’.\n\n“I was aiming to be an SCDF paramedic at first, but there was no opening at the time. Later, I tried out for the Fire and Rescue Specialist track, which I thought was equally interesting,” she said.\n\nCapt Ganga joined the SCDF in 2006, while continuing with her higher education.\n\nShe went on to complete her bachelor’s degree in management with law in 2011, and then a masters in public administration in 2021.\n\nShe met her husband in the SCDF while they were training together.\n\n“We had the privilege to see and experience each other’s ups and downs in a work setting, and fell in love,” she said. The couple married in 2009 and have two daughters aged 13 and 11.\n\nOver the years, Capt Ganga has been called upon to tackle multiple fires, and she looks back on her career with much satisfaction.\n\nGradually, she has also changed the minds of family members and friends who were sceptical about her non-conventional career choice initially.\n\n“They are all now very supportive of my career in the SCDF, better appreciating its noble mission of saving lives and property,” she said.\n\n“I believe that with the right training and attitude, you can develop the skills and ability to perform the role of an emergency responder – be it as a paramedic or a fire and rescue specialist.”\n\n“My mother advised me that, given my personality, I should look for a job that was not ‘deskbound’”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fea5344945c974de3b6c7635da9a50641184a04417619f2103298775ccbfb4b2?w=825", "alt_text": "SCDF Captain Gangadevi Rountan."}]}

The previous high was 28,410 infections a week in March.\n\nMr Ong responded to questions on the spike in Covid-19 infections during a media doorstop at the launch of a framework to stem healthcare worker abuse.\n\nHe said the healthcare impact of the latest spike in numbers is low, with fewer than 10 cases in the intensive care unit. There were 560 hospitalised Covid-19 cases on Dec 13, fewer than a third of the 1,726 at the peak of the pandemic.\n\nFor now, it is still hard to tell if Singapore has hit the peak of the current wave. Currently, there are about 5,000 Covid-19 cases daily, and while those numbers could go up, it is not something the country has not experienced before.\n\n“All in all, we can withstand this. We have gone through over three years of pandemic, with all kinds of safe management measures. Finally, earlier this year, we (transited) to Dorscon Green.

Santosh Kumar\n\nNARENDRA MODI, PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA\n\nNovember 30 marked 365 days since India assumed the G20 Presidency. It is a moment to reflect, recommit and rejuvenate the spirit of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (One Earth, One Family, One Future).\n\nAs India undertook this responsibility last year, the global landscape grappled with multifaceted challenges: recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, looming climate threats, financial instability and debt distress in developing nations, all amid declining multilateralism. In the midst of conflicts and competition, development cooperation suffered, impeding progress.\n\nAssuming the G20 Chair, India sought to offer the world an alternative to the status quo, a shift from a GDP-centric to human-centric progress. India aimed to remind the world of what unites us, rather than what divides us. Finally, the global conversation had to evolve - the interests of the few had to give way to the aspirations of the many. This required a fundamental reform of multilateralism as we knew it.\n\nInclusive, ambitious, action-oriented and decisive — these four words defined our approach as G20 president, and the New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration (NDLD), unanimously adopted by all G20 members, is testimony to our commitment to deliver on these principles.\n\nInclusivity has been at the heart of our presidency. The inclusion of the African Union (AU) as a permanent member of the G20 integrated 55 African nations into the forum, expanding it to encompass 80 per cent of the global population. This proactive stance has fostered a more comprehensive dialogue on global challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind “Voice of the Global South Summit”, convened by India in two editions, heralded a new dawn of multilateralism. India mainstreamed the Global South’s concerns in international discourse and has ushered in an era where developing countries take their rightful place in shaping the global narrative.\n\nInclusivity also infused India’s domestic approach to G20, making it a People’s Presidency that befits the world’s largest democracy. Through “Jan Bhagidari” (people’s participation) events, G20 reached 1.4 billion citizens, involving all states and Union Territories as partners. And on substantive elements, India ensured that international attention was directed to broader developmental aims, aligning with G20’s mandate.\n\nAt the critical midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, India delivered the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), taking a cross-cutting, action-oriented approach to interconnected issues, including health, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability.\n\nA key area driving this progress is robust Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Here, India was decisive in its recommendations, having witnessed the revolutionary impact of digital innovations like Aadhaar, UPI, and Digilocker first-hand.\n\nThrough G20, we successfully completed the Digital Public Infrastructure Repository, a significant stride in global technological collaboration. This repository, featuring over 50 DPIs from 16 countries, will help the Global South build, adopt and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.\n\nFor our One Earth, we introduced ambitious and inclusive aims to create urgent, lasting and equitable change. The Declaration’s “Green Development Pact” addresses the challenges of choosing between combating hunger and protecting the planet, by outlining a comprehensive roadmap where employment and ecosystems are complimentary, consumption is climate conscious and production is planet-friendly.\n\nIn tandem, the G20 Declaration calls for an ambitious tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Coupled with the establishment of the Global Biofuels Alliance and a concerted push for Green Hydrogen, the G20’s ambitions to build a cleaner, greener world is undeniable. This has always been India’s ethos, and through Lifestyles for Sustainable Development (LiFE), the world can benefit from our age-old sustainable traditions.\n\nIt is a matter of pride that during our Presidency, G20 achieved 87 outcomes and 118 adopted documents, a marked rise from the past.\n\nIndia led deliberations on geopolitical issues and their impact on economic growth and development. Terrorism and the senseless killing of civilians is unacceptable, and we must address it with a policy of zero-tolerance. We must embody humanitarianism over hostility and reiterate that this is not an era of war.\n\nI am delighted that India achieved the extraordinary: it revitalised multilateralism, amplified the voice of the Global South, championed development and fought for the empowerment of women, everywhere.\n\nAs we hand over the G20 Presidency to Brazil, we do so with the conviction that our collective steps for people, planet, peace and prosperity will resonate for years to come.\n\nIndia aimed to remind the world of what unites us, rather than what divides us.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/942248c66150e730dd723f123a7e77b35c7f8ddda4144c7836384a41ede8b15b?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the G20 virtual summit in New Delhi on November 22."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBollywood’s Mr Perfectionist, Aamir Khan, was one of the celebrities rescued by fire and rescue personnel in Chennai on Tuesday, after heavy rain brought by Cyclone Michaung flooded many parts of the city and disrupted normal lives.\n\nThe actor was left for more than 24 hours without water, electricity, and a weak phone signal in the waterlogged Karpakkam area, where he was staying with Tamil actor and producer Vishnu Vishal and Vishal’s badminton-player wife Jwala Gutta.\n\nAamir Khan was in Chennai to be with his mother Zeenat Hussain, who was receiving treatment at a private medical facility.\n\nThough the rain stopped by Wednesday, most parts of the city remained submerged, with heavy inundation in low-lying areas.\n\nAmid the chaotic situation, Aamir and Jwala were rescued by the fire and rescue department in a boat.\n\nSharing the photos from the rescue operation, Jwala wrote: “Huge respect to the emergency services who are working day and night to rescue people like us stranded in flooded communities.”\n\nIn one of the photos, her husband Vishal can also be spotted.\n\nEarlier, Vishal shared a couple of photos from the terrace to show his house getting flooded.\n\nHe wrote on X: “Water is entering my house and the level is rising badly in Karapakkam. I have called for help. No electricity, no Wifi. No phone signal. Nothing. Only on terrace at a particular point I can get some signal. Lets hope I and so many here get some help. I can feel for people all over Chennai.”\n\nThe fire and rescue service responded quickly to the distress call, dispatching boats for the rescue effort.\n\nExpressing gratitude on social media, Vishal shared photos of the rescue operation and praised the efforts of the fire and rescue department.\n\nHe wrote: “Thanks to the fire and rescue department for helping people like us who are stranded. Rescue operations have started in Karapakkam. Saw 3 boats functioning already. Great work by (Tamil Nadu) govt in such testing times. Thanks to all the administrative people who are working relentlessly.”\n\nIn another post, he said: “More than 30 people were taken out from our villa community, with many old people as well. Thanks to the firemen who helped us all and are helping other people in Karapakkam... We gave them some food that we had.”\n\nChennai came to a standstill following heavy rain and flooding. Seventeen people died in the city due to rain-related incidents, making it one of the worst affected places due to the cyclone.\n\nAs many as 10 incidents of drowning and electrocution have been reported and medical assistance has been provided, Greater Chennai Police said.\n\nRescuers used boats to reach people stranded in their homes amid widespread flooding, after Michaung barrelled into the southern coast, bringing in heavy rain and winds that uprooted trees and damaged roads.\n\nThe cyclone made landfall in Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRescuers used inflatable rafts and ropes to pluck people out of their homes in Chennai, a city of more than six million people.\n\nLocal media showed images of rescue workers wading through waist-deep water and of submerged vehicles. Air force helicopters also dropped food rations to people stranded in flooded homes.\n\n“There are pockets of low lying areas,” said Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Dr J. Radhakrishnan. “We hope to clear it soon.”\n\nBut there were several complaints about the rescue efforts, with actress Aditi Balan alleging that she was asked to make way for Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s convoy when she was rescuing her family.\n\nTaking to her official X account, she wrote: “I was asked to move my car while waiting to pick up family that was walking through the stagnant water because the CM convoy was approaching.\n\n“Government, where are you? I just went to Radhakrishnan Nagar, Thiruvamiyur. Water from surrounding areas has been pumped into this area. There were dead animals floating around. We had to walk through the entire stagnation to rescue two kids and their grandma. Meanwhile, a boat with six cops rowed into River View Road in Kottur Puram to pick up one influential lady.”\n\nOn Wednesday, she said that “nothing has changed” in Radhakrishnan Nagar and that people are still stuck there.\n\n“Why isn’t anyone from the Greater Chennai Corporation reaching out to anyone there,” Aditi asked.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, which also bore the brunt of the cyclone, roads were damaged and trees uprooted as big waves crashed into the coast.\n\nThis week’s floods in Chennai brought back memories of the extensive damage and loss of life caused by floods eight years ago. Around 290 people were killed then.\n\nSome residents questioned the ability of the city’s infrastructure to handle extreme weather.\n\nMr Stalin has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Rs5,060 crore ($813 million) for the damage.\n\nCivil engineer and geo-analytics expert Raj Bhagat P said better drainage systems in the city would not have been able to prevent the flooding.\n\n“This solution would have helped a lot in moderate and heavy rainfall, but not in very heavy and extremely heavy rains,” he said.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service, Reuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0c344ec6dbcb162611f20a13658cdfbfce9efa5d24a38b5bebd7b111aa70ef23?w=825", "alt_text": "Film stars Aamir Khan and Vishnu Vishal, badminton player Jwala Gutta and others being rescued in Chennai."}]}

Less than a minute later, however, he reappeared, walking next to the bus and looking in through the front door, pleading with the driver to let him back on.\n\nWhen the driver waved him off, Mr Sakthivel was undeterred, now almost running alongside the bus. His dorm was located more than 25km away, and public transport would have been difficult to manage for a highly inebriated man.\n\nMoments later, he slipped on the wet road and fell face down into the path of the front left wheel of the bus. Although the driver stopped the bus almost immediately, the wheel had already gone over the worker’s head and torso, killing him instantly.\n\nA crowd of migrant workers surrounded the vehicle when they realised a man had been run over.\n\nAnd that’s when it all happened so quickly.\n\nSome of the workers got upset. They thought Mr Sakthivel had been pushed off the bus by Madam Wong. That false narrative spread like wildfire among them – from the scene of the accident to a tavern nearby called “Kodai Canteen”, where migrant workers would congregate to drink liquor. Soon, patrons of the tavern joined the commotion, instigating others that one of their own had been killed.\n\nWhen the bus driver and Ms Wong stayed in the bus and shut the doors, it enraged the crowd even further. “Kill the woman, burn the bus,” they chanted in Tamil, as they punched and kicked the vehicle. They flung shoes, bottles, and even metal drain covers at the bus, shattering its windows.\n\nThe ensuing riot along Race Course Road left 54 officers and eight civilians injured, and some 30 vehicles damaged. Police cars were overturned and burned. An ambulance was set on fire. Hundreds of residents in nearby HDB flats stood outside their corridors and stared in disbelief at the carnage happening below. They were witnessing a scene they had never imagined would be seen on a Singapore street.\n\nYet, if you visited the area the following morning, you could hardly tell that Singapore’s worst major public order incident since the racial riots in the 1960s had occurred the night before. Debris had been swept up, burnt cars towed away, barriers were put in place – no one even crossed the road for most of the day. That’s Singapore for you. Even when the unprecedented occurs, the clean-up is prompt.\n\nThe aftermath, however, wasn’t as quiet. Immediately, a temporary ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol in Little India was implemented. The ban was then extended for six months, and in 2015, a designated Liquor Control Zone was established, prohibiting the public consumption of alcohol – outside of licensed establishments – in Little India from 7am on Saturdays to 7am on Mondays.\n\nThe area also saw a stark increase in surveillance. The number of police cameras deployed in the district rose from 34 in 2016 to about 200 in April 2020.\n\nMr Paul Ganapathy, 60, a resident at Chander Road, said the riot, ironically, led to improvements in the area. He pointed to the new bus interchange in Tekka Lane, which allows migrant workers to board buses in a more orderly fashion.\n\n“If you’re drunk, they won’t even let you on the bus to begin with,” he said. “In a way, (the riot) changed things for the better. Before, there were no proper places for buses to pick up or drop off  workers to and from the dormitories, or areas for people to sit or stand. So the workers would just sit in groups in the open field, sometimes even when it rained.”\n\n“Sundays now are also a lot quieter. From my flat, I don’t hear any more drunken fights happening on the streets.”\n\nWhile the consequential rulings and infrastructure have indeed improved things for migrant workers in Little India, things took an uncomfortable turn for many of them soon after the riot.\n\nFor almost everyone in the Indian migrant worker community, Little India means so much. The food, the sights, the smells, the sounds – all of which remind them of home. Then almost overnight, they had become persona non grata, in their own enclave.\n\nNaturally, Little India saw a salient increase in police presence immediately after the incident. And some workers felt the brunt of it, so to speak.\n\n“We were looked upon suspiciously by the police whenever we hung around the area,” said Mr Marimuthu, an Indian national who is a chef at a renowned restaurant in Race Course Road.\n\n“Even when we weren’t drinking or doing anything suspicious, we would be asked to leave the area if there were too many of us in a group.”\n\nSmall business owner and former construction worker Nadanasigamani Sendhil said he felt some hostility from the locals after the incident.\n\n“There were some who did not wish to sit next to workers, or stand near us on public transport. I did feel embarrassed and ashamed over what happened,” said the 48-year-old.\n\n“Colleagues of other races at work asked me, ‘Why are Indians like this? Coming to our country to riot. We have not had this since the 1950s’.\n\n“But they fail to understand the situation of these workers. After a week of hard manual labour, many of us go to Little India to relax. What led to the riot was not so much because of the alcohol as much as it was due to misplaced anger that a life was lost.”\n\nToday, Little India is the same vibrant area it was before 2013, albeit with some adjustments.\n\nThe Kodai Canteen, though still in business, has changed ownership more than twice since 2013. It looks very different now, more of a quiet food court than a boisterous tavern. The place is still frequented by workers, but they leave the premises after dinner. No longer are there sights of beer bottles flooding the table tops.\n\nAt the new Tekka Lane bus interchange, around 9.30pm, workers board the buses with ease and order. No one is too drunk to ride.\n\nTen years on from the night Little India burned, you could walk along Race Course Road and not imagine such bedlam once took place there.\n\nThen again, you couldn’t tell the day after either.\n\nAdditional reporting by K Janarthanan\n\n“What led to the riot was not so much because of the alcohol as much as it was due to misplaced anger that a life was lost.”\n\nSmall business owner \nNadanasigamani Sendhil", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5a8eee5db54cb8ac7004f722de698c431921fd6415a1170e6e720f636d2d47a9?w=825", "alt_text": "The Kodai Canteen, a tavern along Chander Road today looks much changed from a decade ago when it was often packed with migrant workers on Sunday evenings."}]}

For Swati, who stayed in Singapore for three days, it was challenging to run in the heat and humidity, given her condition. “Thankfully, there were plenty of water points that helped me manage it,” she said.\n\nSwati, an Instagram influencer who works with fashion, fitness and lifestyle brands, has raced in  a sari before, though this was the first time she did so for a half-marathon.\n\nShe trains regularly at the gym and runs three times a week.\n\n“Fortunately, I have doctors who take care of me really well, and my family supports me every step of my life,” she said.\n\n“They feel incredibly proud of me for working hard on my goals and achieving them. They’re also really happy that my MS doesn’t bother me and that I carry on with life, taking each day as it comes.”\n\nHer father, now retired, is training for a full marathon.

Clarke, tells the story of a group of explorers who intercept an alien spaceship entering the Solar System.\n\n“The book was a major influence in stoking my enthusiasm for science,” Mr Praveen said. “At that age, it inspired me to dream of working in space exploration.”\n\nNow 31, Mr Praveen said the dream of humans colonising space “isn’t too far off”.\n\nHis work, as chief operating officer of Equatorial Space Systems, a rocket propulsion and space launch start-up in Singapore, has been towards that aim.\n\nEquatorial has plans to launch suborbital rockets, or rockets that can reach the boundary of space before falling back to Earth, by the first half of 2024. It also aims to launch orbital rockets – rockets designed to reach space and orbit the Earth – by 2026, reported The Straits Times.\n\nThese rockets are designed to carry payloads such as research equipment and satellite parts.\n\nEquatorial’s eventual goal is to send humans into space.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to create a human space flight that will enable two to four people to travel into space and back. In the next ten years, we hope to accomplish it,” Mr Praveen said.\n\nSince 2020, the company has launched two rockets, and its next mission is the Rhumi project, which Equatorial hopes will be the world’s first hybrid rocket on a mobile platform.\n\nThe launch pad will be designed in the form of a truck that can be taken anywhere, explained Mr Praveen. Typically, space rockets are launched from fixed launch pads, which cost three times more than mobile launch pads.\n\nBorn and educated in India, Mr Praveen enrolled at the National University of Singapore where he earned a degree in Material Science and Engineering.\n\nIn 2017, at a career networking event, he met Mr Simon Gwozdz, a fellow science and space enthusiast. The two then merged their ideas and goals to form Equatorial that same year.\n\nThe first milestone for the start-up came in December 2020, when it successfully launched a Low Altitude Demonstrator prototype space rocket from Malaysia. It was the first such commercially built prototype rocket test flight in South-east Asia.\n\nIn 2022, Equatorial created a rocket that was launched in Tamil Nadu by Indian aerospace company Space Zone India.\n\n“Space Zone India is collaborating with us on Mission Rhumi,” said Mr Praveen, adding that the two firms recently signed a memorandum of understanding for the project in the presence of Indian space scientist Mylaswamy Annadurai.\n\n“Dorado, our own rocket, is what we plan to build next. The rocket is a suborbital one that has a 100km range and can lift up to 25kg,” he added.\n\nUnlike in the past, when the aerospace industry relied on government initiatives, now, private companies are expanding in this arena, he said.\n\nTo date, the start-up has raised US$2.6 million ($3.6 million) from investors, including Elev8, Seeds Capital and Masik Enterprises.\n\nMr Praveen said this will serve as a springboard for further successes in the field.\n\n“The progress I have seen in this field of work disproves the common idea that success requires a strong financial position. It takes (mostly) talent and interest to succeed in this field,” he said.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to create a ‘human space flight’ that will enable two to four people to travel into space and back.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/483d86c49838243264791306b6dc2db0781bbd135f213d89342117efd44e4ea2?w=825", "alt_text": "Aerospace firm Equatorial Space Systems co-founder Praveen Ganapathi Perumal."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nR. Vaishali and R. Praggnanandhaa have etched their names in the annals of chess by becoming the world’s first brother-and-sister Grandmasters.\n\nThe 22-year old Chennai-based Vaishali crossed the 2500 rating mark at the IV El Llobregat Open in Spain last Friday. Pragg, 18, became the second-youngest Grandmaster in 2018. He was 10 years old when he became the then-youngest International Master, the second-highest title after Grandmaster.\n\nThe first in the family to play chess, Vaishali becomes India’s third female Grandmaster after Koneru Humpy and Harika Dronavalli. Last month, she defeated three former world champions to win the Women’s Grand Swiss tournament and qualify for the Women’s Candidates tournament.\n\nThe pair’s achievements at relatively young ages are remarkable. But it was not without a dose of sibling rivalry.\n\nVaishali told the BBC that there was a bit of edginess at home when her brother attained early success. It took her time to accept that he was an exceptional talent.\n\n“Suddenly at home, the focus was entirely on him,” Vaishali said. “It upset me. I don’t think I managed those emotions well. My parents would chat with me about it and I’d be okay for a while. But every time he had a great result and the attention was on him, I would slip back to feeling a bit miserable.\n\n“It took me some time to overcome those feelings and accept that he is exceptional. Once I completed my Woman Grandmaster (WGM) title, I felt better about myself. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been nothing but proud of his achievements. I see the hard work behind it.”\n\nVaishali was introduced to chess by her father Rameshbabu, himself a chess player. Rameshbabu handles the logistics while their mother Nagalakshmi accompanies the children to tournaments around the world.\n\nThe siblings are different: Praggnananandhaa is an extrovert, fun-loving, and gregarious, while Vaishali is quiet, introverted and prone to overthinking.\n\nVaishali said the pandemic brought them closer and Praggnanandhaa is now someone she turns to when she is unsure.\n\n“During the pandemic, we talked about all sorts of things that we never did before,” she said. “He has a lot of confidence and clarity. Sometimes when I’m feeling lost or unsure, I turn to him. He often has the right answers.\n\n“Not too many others in chess have someone they can go back to, a family member, or an active player with whom they can analyse games. It’s only now that I think we both really value this privilege.”\n\nWhen they began training under Grandmaster R.B. Ramesh as kids, Vaishali was the higher-rated player. Over the years, their journey in the game took different paths and it was often accompanied by stabs of envy for the one trying to keep up.\n\n“It’s never easy for the sibling who’s on the other side,” said Ramesh. “For the longest time, the media would turn up at their home after a major result from Praggnanandhaa and ask Vaishali how it felt to be his sister or ask their parents how proud they were of their son.\n\n“I think somewhere in her head it converted into pressure; the pressure to perform and not be ignored.”\n\nThe urgency to get to a Grandmaster title and not be cast into oblivion made Vaishali take risks at times. Sometimes they worked, at other times they didn’t.\n\nBut now that she’s doing well by sticking to what she knows best, the pressure has eased, and the results are showing.\n\nVaishali and Pragg have also became the first brother-sister duo to make the Candidates, the qualifying event for the World Championship match. The Candidates will be held in Toronto in April.\r\r“We have grown up winning age-group tournaments together,” Vaishali said. “Recently, we won the same medals at the Olympiad and Asian Games. Now we’re headed to the biggest tournament of our lives together,” she said.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\nEvery time he had a great result and the attention was on him, I would slip back to feeling a bit miserable.\n\nR.

A meal that reminds us of home also speaks for the yearning that our migrant friends have of their loved ones at home,” he added.\n\nMr Thayumanaran Nagarethinam, from Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu, contributed his nandu (crab)  rasam recipe to the book – a dish which SMS Koh had the chance to taste at the book launch.\n\n“I learnt to cook this from my grandparents.

Santosh Kumar\n\nRAVYA NANWANI\n\nMesmerising, soulful, melodious. These words are not enough to explain the magic that Arijit Singh wove at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Dec 2, when he regaled a capacity audience of 10,000 for four hours with his unique voice.\n\nBollywood’s foremost singer, who has sung for multiple hit movies in recent years and has a huge fan following, was passionate on stage. His high-energy performance included numbers from his wide repertoire – deep melodies, upbeat tunes and sultry ballads.\n\nThe 36-year-old, who has more than 600 songs to his name in various languages, was staging a concert in Singapore after seven years. And the audience was moved. Many observed that it was the most enthralling show by an Indian musician here in a long time.\n\nThe stage was like a movie set, with a giant LED screen allowing spectators to view the show from different angles. The lighting was top-notch, with special effects that included showers of colourful confetti to match some of his tracks.\n\nThe concert started at 6.40pm with his most popular number “Tum Hi Ho”, a romantic song from the 2013 Hindi movie Aashiqui 2, which has garnered more than 700 million views on YouTube.\n\nIt continued with his trademark soulful songs, party tracks and soothing ballads, the night ending with his latest hit “Satranga” from the film Animal.\n\nIn between, he also sang Bollywood hits from the 1970s and 80s, including “Lag Ja Gale” and “Kabhi Kabhi”.\n\nArijit’s control over the high notes was flawless, and the stadium erupted in cheers and dances when he sang hits such as “Jhoome Jo Pathaan”, “Kabira”, “Deva Deva”, “Kesariya” and “Chaleya”.\n\nFans even switched on the torches on their mobile phones, creating an enchanting organic light show.\n\nArijit, often referred to as the “King of Playback Singing”, has a voice that makes any song wonderful to listen to. He has a special ability to surprise with improvisations. He is also versatile, which makes him a perfect choice for almost any type of song.\n\nAnd throughout the four-hour show, he kept smiling while singing, waving to fans and interacting with them in between songs.\n\nRoshny Mahboobani, a fashion boutique owner from Jakarta who was in the audience, turned 40 that day. Her husband flashed his phone screen at Arijit mentioning her name.\n\nHe immediately acknowledged it and wished Roshny a happy birthday.\n\nIn between songs, Arijit signed autographs on papers, handbags, T-shirts and jerseys.\n\nAs a hardcore Arijit fan, I grabbed the opportunity to be a part of the organising team when Advaita Events’ Jinny Nevatia offered me a role.\n\nI could see first-hand how much people love him. Tickets sold out within a few weeks of release as hundreds of fans flew in from cities such as Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bangkok to catch the show.\n\nRoshny, who had been to an Arijit concert in London before, found the Singapore experience way better.\n\nSymone Budhrani, a lawyer from Hong Kong, was impressed with the singer, whom she found to be down to earth. After the show ended, Arijit went backstage and met the sponsors and organising team. He even posed for photos with the security guards and ground crew.\n\nI took the chance to click a photo with him and talk to him for a few minutes.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nShiv Tandan thinks he opted for the wrong engineering course.\n\nWhile he has always loved making new things, the 33-year-old ended up studying industrial and systems engineering at the National University of Singapore on an SIA Youth Scholarship. The course was focused on management, optimisation and process control.\n\nThe business of engineering wasn’t nearly as appealing to him, and his creative energy was looking for an outlet.\n\n“It was my incredible fortune that NUS Stage (the campus theatre group) got Checkpoint Theatre on as mentors,” said Shiv, who was born in Ambala, Haryana. “And I found my home there, making plays.”\n\nHe spent nine years in Singapore after he joined Anderson Junior College at age 15.  In the later years,  he  immersed himself in theatre work for Checkpoint.\n\nSo, it was no surprise he decided to take up writing and direction as a full-time profession when he moved to Mumbai in 2015.\n\nThe initial years were a struggle, and that features prominently in his play Fistful Of Rupees, which was staged last month by his Mumbai-based theatre company Stone Paper Stories at the Esplanade’s Kalaa Utsavam – Indian Festival of Arts 2023.\n\nIt follows protagonist Raghav’s move from Singapore to Mumbai. But, beyond the superficial humour of culture shock, the play is a reflection on Shiv’s own tussles with belonging.\n\n“I actually worked in Singapore for three years after university before I decided to move to Mumbai,” he said. “I wanted to write and direct in Hindustani too, and Mumbai was the place to be for that. But it was also to be closer to family.\n\n“I started writing as a response to the culture shock. I was not expecting the first few months to be that hard, and writing helped me process what I was seeing and feeling.\n\n“Through the making of the play, I met so many (newcomers) just like myself, and I realised what I was feeling was fairly universal in the city. The play eventually became about stories of placelessness and the search for belonging.”\n\nShiv is now more used to life in Mumbai as a full-time writer, director, actor and music composer. Stone Paper Stories recently launched the audio web series And Now Live – India’s first audio show featuring original music performed by the actors themselves.\n\n“Unfortunately in India, fringe theatre doesn’t pay the bills,” said Shiv, who met his wife Maanavi at NUS and has been married for seven years. “It is, however, a relatively inexpensive place to hone your craft as an artiste. Theatre is also a launchpad for a lot of other work which does pay well, which is why theatre-making is still alive and well.”\n\nRecently, he co-wrote and co-directed a kids musical called Say Cheese Grandpa with Saregama to positive reviews. He plans to bring it to Singapore next. He is also working on a superhero comedy tackling global warming, tentatively titled The Chattaans. It opens next month.\n\nAfter that, he will be back in Singapore as assistant director for Secondary, Checkpoint’s new musical production that opens in April.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/959dc7453871efafce941604e3da4be9e7c85b4fdc7a2911d0d787d06caa7434?w=825", "alt_text": "Shiv Tandan was studying engineering at NUS when he fell in love with theatre through the campus theatre group."}]}
