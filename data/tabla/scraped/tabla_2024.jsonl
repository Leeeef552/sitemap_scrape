Training sessions are held at PAssion Wave @ Jurong Lake Gardens, as well as PA centres in Sembawang, Bukit Batok and Punggol.\n\n“My husband was actually a taekwondo instructor for eight years,” said Piriyah.\n\n“But he also trained in Silambam under international grandmaster P. Selvaraj Aasan, who runs the International Silambam Academy in India. So we decided to open the Singapore branch and focus on silambam.\n\n“The People’s Association then granted us permission to hold our training sessions at their venues, and that has helped us a lot.”\n\nUsing long sticks, silambam practitioners learn armed as well as unarmed combat – though the martial art form also demands that students exercise restraint and maintain self-control at all times.\n\nSilambam, with its stylised ritualistic steps ensconced in traditional Indian folk art, is practised in places in India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and even England and the United States.\n\n“To learn the bare hand pattern, weapon event and stick fight, it would take three to four years to reach black-belt status,” explained Piriyah.\n\n“Silambam is taught in different ways in different places, and you never really stop learning. My husband has been practising the art form for 22 years – and he’s still learning.”\n\nNotably, the martial art form has seen a rise in popularity among women over the past few years.\n\nAccording to Piriyah, among the students aged above 14 in the academy, three-quarters are women.\n\n“At our classes in Jurong on Fridays, parents would initially send their kids, but after a while the mothers started to join in. So now that has become a bit of a ladies’ class,” Piriyah said.\n\n“We have one student, Rajee, who enrolled her three kids at first. Later, she too joined us. All four of them competed in India.”\n\nA. Rajee, who is in her thirties, bagged silver medals in the stick fight and bare hands categories.\n\nShe said the team’s success in India would hopefully shine the limelight on silambam in Singapore.\n\n“In my generation, the concept of silambam wasn’t articulated openly. It’s a good thing for us to have participated in the competition, because now silambam has at least been highlighted through our achievements,” she said.\n\nIt’s a good thing for us \nto have participated\nin the competition, because now silambam has at least been highlighted through our achievements.”\n\nA.

Santosh Kumar\n\nA. VISHNU VARDNI\n\nTraditional Indian music roared through the streets of Little India and Dhoby Ghaut on Thursday, as more than 18,000 devotees marked the annual rite of Thaipusam.\n\nA number comparable to last year’s, the devotees engaged in penitential acts along a walk of faith for Hindu god Murugan.\n\nThaipusam is observed by Hindus in the month of Thai in the Tamil calendar to commemorate the act of Goddess Parvati presenting the “vel” (lance) to her son Lord Murugan as an embodiment of her “shakti”, or power, to vanquish evil and restore peace and well-being.\n\nAmong the 274 kavadi-bearers and 12,800 people carrying paal kudam (milk pots) was 19-year-old first-timer Mithesh, carrying a 35kg alagu kavadi.  A former at-risk youth, the national serviceman is optimistic about turning over a new leaf.\n\nThe alagu kavadi – a structure made of wood and metal – was held in place by some 70 hooks pierced into his body. His nine-day fast and rigorous preparation had culminated in the procession, which he took about three hours to complete.\n\nMithesh’s mother Jewel Kala, 47, shared her joy in witnessing her son’s positive transformation through religion. The single mother of three said: “He is small compared to his kavadi, so there were numerous challenges. I am proud that he saved up and bought his own second-hand kavadi – costing $1,000 – and took the initiative.”\n\nMithesh, who once led a life of bad company and crime, now looks forward to pursuing veterinary science at university, and supporting his mother.\n\n“I am glad religion and devotion has changed me, and I now hope for a brighter future,” said Mithesh, who was accompanied by about 10 people comprising friends and family.\n\nBearing a variety of kavadis and milk pots atop their heads, the devotees in yellow and orange garb completed the 4km foot procession from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road.\n\nDevotees were undeterred by the festival falling on a weekday this year, with some working adults and students taking leave from work to partake in the festivities. Despite the mild showers on Thursday afternoon, devotees persevered through the mostly smooth foot procession.\n\nMinister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo, who attended the festival, highlighted the meaningful participation of non-Hindus, non-Indians and particularly young devotees.\n\nDescribing the crowd as interestingly multiracial and multicultural, she said: “It is most encouraging to me that local non-Hindus supporting their family members or friends are here to observe this as a practice; a fabric of our society.”\n\nWhile expressing her hopes for Thaipusam in Singapore to enter the UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage List, the minister said international recognition would be testament to the nation’s emphasis on safeguarding tradition.\n\nShe also pointed out the importance of Singapore maintaining its unique cultural and religious practices.\n\n“It is important for us as a fairly young nation to think about what binds us together. In many societies, especially fast-paced, modernised ones, these activities are pushed to the fringes and forgotten over time, which is a great loss,” Ms Teo said.\n\nThe tradition of serving lunch for the devotees during Thaipusam too returned at Sri Thendayuthapani Temple after three years of bento box distributions.\n\nMr Lionel Tan, who for the past 14 years has accompanied his childhood friend Paul Singh at Thaipusam, took leave from work to help assemble the latter’s kavadi, and support him throughout the procession.\n\nFour Chinese friends – Ken Ho, Lim Eng Kin, Ken Ng and Edwin Foo – stood out from the crowd, as they carried milk pots, and had their foreheads, mouths and torso pierced.\n\nThey have been attending Thaipusam for several years, they said.\n\nMr Lim, 65, a fork-lift driver, said: “When I was young, I was always fascinated by Thaipusam processions. A few years ago, I was introduced to this by an Indian friend. It has cleared my conscience and I feel much better.”\n\nThe festivities ran from 11.30pm on Wednesday to Thursday night. Devotees received support from local companies that set up 23 beverage booths along the procession route.\n\nThe festival was a result of five months of preparations and the help of 1,500 volunteers, said Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple’s chairman Sivakumaran Sathappan.\n\n“It is most encouraging that non-Hindus supporting their family or friends are here to observe this as a practice; a fabric of our society.”\n\nMinister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/54fe7d4423d2c3980395eb3d89bf6d6942b9ea655c0e664dce0d95d33201ca72?w=825", "alt_text": "Mithesh carrying kavadi during Thaipusam."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nThe media scrum over the treatment of an Indian rape victim at a Singapore hospital forms the basis of the short film Saahasi: Dateline Singapore, which is available for public viewing on YouTube.\n\nSingaporean Gurdip Singh, 73, who in real life is a freelance journalist, is the lead character in the 27-minute venture.\n\nInspired by his own experience during the ordeal, the short film depicts what Gurdip witnessed and endured during the incident in December 2012.\n\n‘The behaviour of the Indian journalists was shocking,” he told tabla!\n\n“They were badgering everyone for news about the victim and putting pressure on officials for answers. I had never seen media persons behaving in this manner before.\n\n“Obviously, Television Rating Points (TRP) mattered a lot to them, and they wanted to be the first to break the news. But this is not how the media operates in Singapore. We follow certain rules and ethics.”\n\nProducer and director Zafar Anjum uses Gurdip’s observations and takes fictional licence to tell a gripping story, whose backdrop is the gang-rape and torture of Nirbhaya, a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern, by six men in a private bus in which she was travelling with her male friend in New Delhi on Dec 16, 2012.\n\nShe was flown on Dec 26 by air ambulance to Singapore as her condition deteriorated and received treatment at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. She died 48 hours later.\n\nThe film explores the clash of journalistic values between Gurdip and Garima, a journalist from India played by Singapore-based actress Veena Puthran Bangera.\n\nGurdip grew up in Singapore and is calm and rules-based in his approach.\n\nGarima is a young and dynamic go-getter who works for an Indian TV news channel. She is aggressive and TRP-driven, but faces limitations in Singapore where regulations are followed when it comes to personal privacy. This is unlike in India where media in general has a freer hand in getting through barriers for insights and inside stories.\n\nWhile pursuing the story, the two journalists clash a few times.\n\n“The film is primarily about media ethics, of how two journalists form India and Singapore operate. But beyond that, it is a narrative on human behaviour, such as ruthless ambition,” said Zafar, a Singapore-based author and filmmaker.\n\n“It also reflects on how women are treated, and the compassion and exemplary behaviour of individuals and officials.”\n\nThe short film also features Singapore-based actors Rachna Anand, Nidhi Chopra Khanna, Pankaj Kumar, Neil Daswani, Edmund Chow, Hannah Wong, Jawahar Kanjilal and Tejas Chitaliya.\n\n“Saahasi is simple, yet complex on many levels,” said scriptwriter Sunita Lad Bhamray.\n\n“Modern audiences are very well-informed, and I’m sure each one will be able to take home its true meaning and intent.”\n\n‘The behaviour of the Indian journalists was shocking.

Rahman sir then told me what he wanted as I hung on to his every word.\n\n“He wanted a fast-paced ‘mass’ rap background score, and he wanted it as soon as possible. Next thing I knew, I was calling my team back to the studio.”\n\nIn the next few hours, Raja and his team set to work on the piece, starting with the lyrics and then moving on to the beat.\n\n“We were spurred on by the fact that the maestro himself had called,” said Raja. “It was nearly dawn when we sent him the piece, virtually.”\n\nAll rapped and done, Raja was anxious to know if Rahman liked his effort and would use it.\n\nThe answer came the very next day when the 57-year-old composer, through Kumaran, informed Raja that the track was being used.\n\n“I had Kumaran re-enact Rahman sir’s entire reaction to me via a phone call,” said Raja.\n\n“Apparently he heard my bit, smiled and said it was good in Tamil.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the much-awaited Ram temple in Ayodhya, in a political triumph for the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) most popular leader, who is seeking re-election in this year’s parliamentary elections, due before May.\n\nThe temple fulfilled a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus who worship the revered deity and extol him for the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance.\n\nThe BJP, which seized on the demand, has portrayed the Ram temple as central to its vision of reclaiming Hindu pride, which it says was suppressed by centuries of Mughal rule and British colonialism.\n\nMr Modi and his ruling BJP hope that opening the Ram temple in India’s most populated state Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha (lower house) seats, will help catapult the prime minister to a record third successive term in power. But, with the temple still under construction, critics have accused Mr Modi of a hurried opening to woo voters.\n\nMr Modi, dressed in a traditional kurta tunic, led the opening ceremony as Hindu priests chanted hymns inside the temple’s inner sanctum.\n\nA conch was blown by a priest to mark the temple’s opening and Mr Modi placed a lotus flower in front of the black stone Ram Lalla idol, decked in intricate gold ornaments and holding a golden bow and arrow. He later prostrated before the idol.\n\nNearly 7,500 people, including elite industrialists, politicians and movie stars, witnessed the ritual on a giant screen outside the temple as an Indian Air Force helicopter showered flower petals.\n\nMr Modi, who last week said god had chosen him to represent all Indians at the opening of the temple, shared a video of his entrance into the temple – carrying offerings for Lord Ram – on social media site X.\n\n“It reinforces his (Mr Modi’s) image as ‘Hindu Hriday Samrat’, or the King of Hindu Hearts,” said journalist and political commentator Neerja Chowdhury.\n\n“The construction of the temple will be a big issue for them (Hindu voters) not because the Ram temple has been built decades after the BJP launched the movement, but because Narendra Modi got it built. It is as much about Modi as it is about the Ram temple. No other government could get it done, but this tough, strong leader has got it done,” she said.\n\nPolitical analysts and critics see Monday’s ceremony as the beginning of the election campaign for Mr Modi.

He had no plans to carry out any attacks here.\n\nHe is the second Singaporean to be dealt with under the ISA after being radicalised by far-right extremist ideologies, said the Internal Security Department (ISD). The first Singaporean, now 19, was released from detention in January after close to three years.\n\nUnder the restriction order, the youth must comply with several conditions, including not being allowed to change his residence or travel out of Singapore, or access the Internet.\n\n“At the point of investigation, he strongly identified himself as a white supremacist and pro-white sympathiser, and hoped to be recruited for violent attacks by white supremacist groups overseas to ‘fight for the whites’,” said ISD.\n\nExplaining how he became radicalised, ISD said he had chanced upon videos by foreign far-right political commentator and white supremacist Paul Nicholas Miller, and was exposed to violent extremist material online. Miller advocates for a race war and has been tied to multiple far-right extremist organisations overseas.\n\nBy early last year, the youth had developed an intense hatred of communities targeted by far-right extremists, including African Americans, Arabs, and LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) individuals.\n\nThe youth participated in far-right online chat groups and channels, where he shared violent anti-African American videos, as doing so gave him a sense of belonging to the white supremacist community.\n\nHe considered travelling to countries such as France, Italy, the US and Russia to participate in attacks against the vilified communities, and also expressed interest in a far-right online chat group in carrying out a mass shooting in the US in 10 years. However, ISD said he did not take steps to actualise his attack aspirations beyond searching online for weapons, because he lacked the money and know-how to do so.\n\nThe youth had not planned to carry out attacks in Singapore as he felt these communities had not caused trouble here, said ISD.\n\nISD urged the public to be vigilant to signs that someone has become radicalised. Those who suspect a person has been radicalised can call the ISD Counter-Terrorism Centre hotline on 1800-2626-473 (1800-2626-ISD).\n\nThe Straits Times\n\n“He strongly identified himself as a white supremacist and hoped to be recruited for violent attacks by groups overseas to ‘fight for the whites’.”\n\nThe Internal Security Department", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/radicalised-teen-on-restriction-order?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nANUSHA SELVAMANI\n\nConstant extra work, little time with family and a lack of career progression were reasons that convinced Mr Kumaran Nagalingam to leave his job as a security officer at Changi Airport after 16 years.\n\nThe 42-year-old had joined the industry thinking it would provide a secure job, but was left frustrated by the low salary he was making.\n\nHis responsibilities included screening passengers’ luggage, managing a team of security officers and reporting incidents.\n\n“There were days when I worked 12 hours and then continued the next day’s shift without any rest. I had no time with my family,” said Mr Kumaran, a father of three.\n\nA decade into the job, he realised his prospects in the job were not promising. “It felt pointless at the end of the day as I wasn’t getting the right pay as well,” he said.\n\nWhen both his parents fell ill to cancer, Mr Kumaran, their only child, decided to leave the job. He is now a Gojek driver. “I felt I wouldn’t be able to take care of my parents with this job. My whole family is relying on me,” he said.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Union of Security Employees, many security officers are looking to leave their jobs owing to low expectations of salary increases and promotions.\n\nIn the survey, done as part of a study on the sector in collaboration with the Singapore University of Social Sciences, 66.6 per cent of the 1,002 security officers interviewed said they “strongly agreed” when asked if they “might look for a new job”.\n\nAbout four in 10 said they continue to see “various forms of abuse at work”. Most of this was verbal, with much of the abuse coming from members of the public.\n\nThe findings also revealed that the welfare of private security officers continue to be of concern, particularly in the areas of mental well-being.\n\nSenior security supervisor Madhavaraj, who works at four commercial buildings on a rotational basis, often gets mocked by people who call him a “watchman”.\n\nBut that has not dampened the spirit of the 57-year-old, who has been in the security line for 18 years.\n\n“It’s not as easy as what many may think,” said Mr Madhavaraj, who works 12-hour shifts and is on duty on public holidays, including Deepavali.\n\n“Apart from staying vigilant, I need to ensure that everything in the building stays proper. It’s not just about safeguarding a place. There are so many technical issues related to security; we need to be tech-savvy too.\n\n“There’s no such thing as an easy job; every job has its own level of stress. It depends on how well you manage your workload.”\n\nFor Ms Reena Raman, however, her job as a senior flight superviser at Changi Airport is everything she hoped it to be.\n\nInitially, she screened passengers’ luggage, but now the 34-year-old supervises more than 100 security officers.\n\n“Working with passengers is no doubt difficult. They will hurl vulgarities when we ask them to abide by the rules,” she said. “But I like my job as I love seeing the different faces of passengers every day.”\n\nMs Reena, who hails from Skudai in Johor, travels between Singapore and Malaysia daily.\n\n“It’s tiring to work 12 hours and travel back to Malaysia,” she said. “But that will not stop me from continuing with this job. I love the airport environment and my boss makes sure I get timely breaks.”\n\n“It’s not just about safeguarding a place.

Surendran and Vinoth Bhaskaran experienced pristine weather conditions when they took the field alongside stars of yesterday such as Sri Lankans Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara and Afghanistan wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Shahzad.\n\nSadly, the pitch at Casey Fields proved to be a stick in the mud – almost literally.\n\nWhen the Wolves, one of eight teams in the competition that was held from Dec 17 to 24, had to chase 110 runs in their second match, the uneven wicket, said Surendran, made it almost an impossible task.\n\n“It was difficult to hit boundaries because you never knew if the ball was coming high or low,” said Surendran, 33, who opened the batting in two of the three matches.\n\n“Unlike most international matches where the pitch is flat, the wicket in Melbourne was very grassy,” added the Singapore international, who scored 35 runs in total over three matches.\n\nVinoth, a left-arm spinner and middle-order batter, agreed with the sentiment. “Everything in Melbourne was top class. The tournament was big and well-organised, but the pitch was sadly not up to standards.”\n\nLaunched in 2021, the Aussie Cricket League is considered a lower rung enterprise, compared to the Big Bash League, the premier annual Twenty20 tournament Down Under.\n\nThe Wolves lost two of their three group matches and did not advance to the semi-finals.\n\nThe Indian Tigers won the tournament after they defeated the Sydney Mavericks in the final.\n\nDespite the pitch discrepancies, Vinoth, 33, who plays for Ceylon Sports Club in the local league and has been in the national team since 2018, was pleased with his performances.\n\nHe bowled 12 overs across three games, taking two wickets with an economy rate of 3.5.\n\nAt one point, Malinga, playing for the Lankan Lions, even praised him on the pitch, much to Vinoth’s delight.\n\n“He said ‘well bowled’ to me after an over. I was happy with my performance. I only allowed one six in three games.\n\n“I also enjoyed bowling during the power play. That was especially fun.”\n\nAccording to the two cricketers, the Wolves are planning to enter a tournament in Canada in July.\n\nWhile the pair are yet to receive an official invitation from the team’s management, they are open to their second stint with the side.\n\n“I’ll go if they call me, no problem,” said Surendran, who had to take unpaid leave from work during the Melbourne experience.\n\nAli Kasim", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/71a07daf377e7f5036172bf3b90a72115537bf3e74c7ccaf28c85dc06a359272?w=825", "alt_text": "C.Surendran meeting Lasith Malinga (right) at the Aussie Cricket League in Melbourne last month."}]}

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/pain-is-bliss-for-thaipusam-devotees-2848410", "site_title": "Pain is bliss for Thaipusam devotees", "publish_date": null, "content": "News\n\nPain is bliss for Thaipusam devotees\n\nUPDATED\n\nJan 19, 2024, 5:30 AM\n\nAli Kasim\n\nALI KASIM\n\nMr Shanmugam Govindarasu still recalls how he felt 26 years ago when he was just 16 and carrying a kavadi (a semi-circular steel and wooden canopy carried by Hindu devotees) for the first time during Thaipusam.\n\n“I had no idea what to expect. During the process, my whole body was numb, the weight on my shoulders was so strenuous. Somehow, my prayers gave me the strength to complete the ritual,” the 42-year-old says in a 40-minute video made by The Straits Times, which will be published online by ST and Tamil Murasu next week.\n\nCelebrated on the full moon day in the Tamil month of Thai on the confluence of star Pusam, Thaipusam is known as one of the most physically demanding religious festivals in the world. It will be held in Singapore on Jan 25.\n\nIn 2022, Singapore shortlisted this Hindu festival for nomination to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Some 30,000 people, including tourists, attend the festivities every year, including about 250 kavadi bearers and 10,000 devotees carrying milk pots.\n\nEvery year, devotees pierce their bodies and carry kavadis – which can be up to 3m high and weigh between 20kg and 30kg – to fulfil their vows and seek the blessings of Lord Murugan, who represents virtue and power and is regarded as the destroyer of evil.\n\nThe ritual also requires devotees to pierce their tongues, torsos and lips with hooks and pointed steel rods, and cheeks with vel skewers – a divine spear associated with Lord Murugan.\n\nKavadi-bearers will then embark on a gruelling barefoot 4km walk from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road to the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road, where they will give their offerings to Lord Murugan. Thaipusam commemorates the deity’s birthday.\n\nThe pain borne by the kavadi-bearers can be difficult to witness. But, beneath the exterior, Thaipusam has a quiet and tender meaning of love and loyalty.\n\nMr S. Ramanathan, in his mid-40s, has also been carrying the kavadi since he was a teenager.\n\n“It’s to follow a spiritual path that was paved by past generations,” he says in the video.\n\n“I start preparing (by fasting and praying) 41 days before the event. That’s the time of change; your mind has to change, all the negative thoughts have to be discarded. The way you eat, the way you think – everything has to be progressively correct before Thaipusam.\n\n“About two weeks before the day, if you’re still not in that state of mind, you’re not going to be ready. And that has happened to me before; the state of my mind was wrong.\n\n“So I made an extra conscious effort the following year to follow the procedure to a tee. Through meditation, I set my mind to focus. That year was fantastic for me. I followed all the guidelines and what was expected of me.”\n\nAt least a week before the festival, devotees go on a vegetarian diet to purify themselves. They believe that as long as they adhere to strict fasting and abstinence, they will not feel any pain.\n\nMr Shanmugam says he refrains from even cutting his nails.\n\n“I normally fast one week before Thaipusam. I’ll go on a vegetarian diet, refrain from shaving, cutting my hair and nails, and I sleep on the floor on a piece of yellow cloth,” he adds. “I’ll go to the temple every day, to meditate and attain peace of mind.”\n\nRegarded as Singapore’s best piercer, Tamilchelvan Suppiah has been piercing the bodies of the devotees for more than 30 years. Now in his 50s, he began performing the sacred and delicate ritual when he was just 15.\n\n“Different devotees have different types of skin. It’s usually more challenging to pierce a devotee who has more hair on his body,” he explains. “It’s easier to pierce someone who sweats more. Oily skin can be difficult, and dry skin too, because it can split when pierced.\n\n“There won’t be any blood when piercing, but some devotees bleed when the piercings are removed, or if they knock into someone or if there is too much movement. But, at most, it’s minor bleeding.”\n\nIn the video, amid a small gathering of friends and family members and loud procession music, Mr Ramanathan, with grey ash smeared across his forehead and chest, stands still in the centre of the Perumal temple as the spikes are pierced through his body without a hitch. He is unfazed by the pain, his mind solely focused on Lord Murugan.\n\n“Getting pierced is a transcending experience,” he says. “You are in a full state of meditation, and you have gone to a further level of surrender. I can’t elaborate further, but you do become a little bit different.”\n\nThe kavadi bearers’ 4km walk takes around four hours to complete, and by the time they reach the end, the pain and exhaustion can be overwhelming.\n\nFor Mr Shanmugam, it is his favourite part of the whole ritual.\n\n“I won’t really dance too much during the procession; I want to reach the Tank Road temple in the fastest time, so that I can see Lord Murugan.,” he says. “My favourite part is when I enter the temple. At the highest point of my prayers, I’m always so energised to see him with my kavadi.”\n\n“Getting pierced is a transcending experience. You are in a full state of meditation... I can’t elaborate further, but you do become a little bit different.”\n\nMr S.

This is indeed a good direction to take,” she said.\n\nLittle India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association (LISHA) president Regunarth Siva Thyagarajan told tabla! that plans to make Little India plastic-free began at the end of last year. “We are hoping for Little India to be plastic free by the end of 2026,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, alternatives such as plates made of leaves and coconut shells and bags made from banana fibres have been researched and considered for implementation.\n\nSingapore Indian Food Suppliers’ Association coordinator S. Mahenthiran pointed out that his own establishment, Gayatri Restaurant, is encouraging customers to bring their own containers for takeaway food. “This will promote food packaging sustainability,” he said.\n\nTekka stall owners like Vignesh Pathma, who is in the meat business, welcomed the alternatives to plastic. “But they should be practical and affordable,” he said.\n\nK.

JANARTHANAN\n\nEngineer Ethiraj Aravindhan smiles as he recalls fond memories of celebrating Pongal, the Tamil harvest festival, while growing up in Ashok Nagar, Chennai.\n\nBonfires and excited chatter would fill the air on Bhogi, the first day of the four-day festivities.\n\n“My friends and I would go around the streets beating drums and singing songs,” said the 53-year-old. “We would collect old items for the bonfire.”\n\nThe main purpose of Bhogi is to honour Lord Indra, the god of rain, and it represents the discarding of useless items to make room for a new beginning and crop.\n\nMr Aravindhan also recalled the taste of the pongal dish (rice cooked with milk) and coffee made with milk fresh from the neighbours’ cows.\n\n“We did not keep cows, but many of our neighbours did,” he said. “At our backyard, my mother would make pongal using a stove made of wood and rocks.”\n\nIn 1970s Chennai, the Pongal festival was a joint-neighbourhood celebration, according to Mr Aravindhan. “Now families have become nuclear and people have drifted apart,” he said.\n\nIn Singapore, it is not feasible for him to celebrate Pongal like he used to during his younger days.\n\nHe arrived here in 1997 and currently resides in Bukit Panjang with his wife and two children.\n\nBut, in keeping with the spirit of Pongal as the season of new beginnings, he and his wife Sumitra, 45, are hoping for the best moving forward as their son Siddharth and daughter Kirthanasri pursue their higher education.\n\n“I did not do well during my first term as I did not adjust well to studies after two years of national service,” said Siddharth, 21, a first-year student at the National University of Singapore.\n\n“I am hoping to change that this year.”\n\nKirthanasri, 17, also hopes for a similar shift.\n\nThe first-year student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic created a 3D model about Pongal celebrations for a class presentation. “My knowledge about Pongal has increased due to the project,” she said.\n\nFor the family, the three-day festival is all about gratitude.\n\n“As part of our prayers, we worship the sun god,” said Mr Aravindhan.\n\n“After cooking pongal in an earthen pot, we offer it to the deities while singing Tamil Thirumurai hymns.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2576a7c84ca4056071a2ee55632d7451b608c1ac962ed02ba2d2d8caf55143aa?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Ethiraj Aravindhan and his family members engaged in cooking pongal."}]}

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I wasn’t precluded from anything,” he said with a wry smile.\n\nPranav, a computer science major, is Singapore’s latest and 29th recipient of the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship this year.\n\nIt is a scholarship programme established at Oxford University in 1903 which aims to select public-spirited leaders and promote international understanding through a community of scholars. Singapore has a conferment of one Rhodes Scholarship a year.\n\nPranav, who has ambitions to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies for medical treatment, was selected from among nine applicants. He will commence post-graduate studies in public policy and applied digital health at the University of Oxford in October this year.\n\nThe decision to create a hypothetical situation just to see the social outcomes it would yield is testament to Pranav’s curious and problem-solving nature.\n\n“I always enjoy breaking down a problem into smaller parts and then figuring out how to solve it,” he said.\n\nAt Stanford, Pranav works as an undergraduate “peer educator” on campus, educating students on topics relevant to campus public health, and specifically as it relates to substance use, well-being, and consent and communication practices.\n\nHis proclivity for helping others undoubtedly stems from a piece of advice given to him by his parents when he was a child. “You must live a life in service,” they told him.\n\nNot that they pushed him towards science or medicine at a young age – as many Indian parents are liable to do. “No, they simply told me to figure out what I want to do and do it well,” Pranav said.\n\nBorn in Chennai, Pranav moved to Singapore with his family when he was four years old.\n\nWhile speaking to tabla!, his accent veered subtly from Singaporean to American – the latter a by-product perhaps of his education at United World College here.\n\nBut he is totally Singaporean, he pointed out, citing his national service in the Army as a key point in his life.\n\n“My time in the Army elicited a lot of personal growth that I’m grateful for now,” he explained.\n\n“The way I went about solving problems before was, in a way, through an engineering mindset. But when I first started in the Army, the physical and emotional challenges of training often didn’t have any immediate solution.\n\n“When you’re in the trenches, mentally and physically, even if you feel the challenges are overwhelming, you can’t just quit. So that forces you to adopt a kind of calm resilience to weather the storm.\n\n“I think that the unique environment of the military, where you live and serve alongside total strangers, teaches you to communicate with others and to lead people in ways not replicated elsewhere.\n\n“Importantly, it taught me to lean more into my community – my peers and commanders in the Army, and also my family and friends – when things felt challenging.”\n\nPranav was commended for his excellent contributions during NS, and as a student in the US he leads national training and recruitment for the United Students for Veterans’ Health group, which organises weekly activities for nursing home patients with dementia.\n\nAspiring to be a medical doctor who also conducts research at the intersection of computation and medicine, Pranav hopes to one day bring large-scale improvements in healthcare delivery.\n\nAt Stanford University, he has applied his talents to conduct research in bioelectronics, cancer biology, and digital health interventions for chronic pain.\n\n“I wanted to pursue a career of service in the broader sense,” he said.\n\n“I saw this scenario in medicine where I could combine my scientific and academic interests with the humanity inherent in helping patients. I realised that was the area I wanted to serve in.”\n\nLooking ahead, Pranav says the goal for him, after Oxford, is to return to the US for medical school.\n\nAfter that, he said he’s “definitely hoping to return to Singapore” for work.\n\n“My dream is to become a physician scientist, and also work on shaping AI policies as it pertains to healthcare in Singapore,” he said.\n\n“I want to come back here when I’m able to change things. In the meantime, I’ll do whatever I can, even if it’s two years here and there, to maximise the impact of my career when I return.”\n\nalikasim@sph.com.sg\n\n“I saw this scenario in medicine where I could combine my scientific and academic interests with the humanity inherent in helping patients.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAviation security regulator Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) on Wednesday slapped penalties totalling Rs1.80 crore ($290,000) on IndiGo and Mumbai International Airport (MIAL) over the recent incident of passengers having food on the tarmac beside an aircraft at the Mumbai airport.\n\nThe airline was fined a total of Rs1.20 crore for various violations, while MIAL was fined Rs60 lakh.\n\nAdditionally, aviation safety watchdog Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) imposed a fine of Rs30 lakh ($48,500) on MIAL for safety-related violations.\n\nOn Tuesday, BCAS had issued show cause notices to the airline and MIAL after a video of passengers sitting on the tarmac and having food there went viral on social media platforms.\n\nThe incident was connected to an IndiGo Goa-Delhi flight on Sunday which was diverted to Mumbai due to massive fog-related disruptions at the Delhi airport.\n\nUpon landing, the passengers were allegedly allowed to disembark on the tarmac and even served refreshments there, something that is against regulations.\n\nAccording to the two aviation regulators, IndiGo also put the passengers on another flight straight from the tarmac without following the procedure of security screening.\n\nAfter the video surfaced on social media platforms on Monday, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia reportedly convened a meeting with officials, following which notices were issued to the airline and the airport operator on Tuesday.\n\nBased on the replies filed by IndiGo and MIAL, the regulators decided to impose hefty fines.\n\nApart from submissions made by IndiGo and MIAL, the BCAS also examined other evidence related to the incident, including footage from security cameras.\n\nAccording to the penalty order issued against IndiGo, the aviation security regulator found that the airline failed to report the incident to BCAS, did not ensure security screening of passengers and their cabin baggage before making them board another flight, and failed to deploy security staff in required numbers and respond to the situation in a “responsible and efficient manner”, among others.\n\nThe BCAS inferred that both IndiGo and MIAL were not proactive in anticipating the situation and making the appropriate facilitation arrangements for passengers.\n\nThe DGCA said it found MIAL in violation of safety regulations as passengers were on an active apron for a considerable period of time. An airport apron refers to the area of an airport where aircraft are parked, refuelled and serviced. According to safety regulations, passengers are not allowed to walk on an active apron.\n\nThe DGCA also imposed fines of Rs30 lakh each on Air India and SpiceJet for failure to comply with directives on rostering of pilots for flight operations in low visibility conditions.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8708d1c8390c0868d22b48ecda22f7d8b20d774a9c1daf5d1354ce676fbd5d3d?w=825", "alt_text": "Stranded passengers eating on the Mumbai airport tarmac on Jan 14."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nANUSHA SELVAMANI\n\nMost Indians in Singapore celebrate Pongal at their homes.\n\nMrs Lalithamma Nair does it a different way.\n\nThough the 63-year-old lives in an HDB flat in Woodlands, for the past five years she has been celebrating the South Indian harvest festival at a rented farmhouse on the outskirts of Kranji.\n\nAccording to Mrs Lalithamma, The Nature Nook @ Kranji Gallop Farm Resort is her second home. She invited me to join her family’s Pongal celebrations there last Saturday.\n\nIntrigued by the name, I took a cab to the farm, where a one-storey terrace house adorned with traditional flowers and sugarcane stalks greeted me.\n\nBehind the house was a small plantation, a rare sight in concrete-laden Singapore. At the balcony area, an elderly woman – a family friend of Mrs Lalithamma – was making vadai.\n\nA vibrantly-painted claypot was ready on a charcoal pit for pongal, a traditional dish of sweet rice in milk, to be cooked.\n\nIn a corner, buttermilk and koozh (porridge made from millet) were being served to guests.\n\nThe atmosphere reminded me of a village house in Tamil Nadu. To Mrs Lalithamma, the place encapsulates her love and connection with nature.\n\n“I love this place so much, it has my whole heart,” she said. “Celebrating Pongal here is much more authentic than doing it at our house. I want the younger generation to know what it feels like to be a farmer and what the harvest festival is really like.”\n\nHer love for nature was kindled during her childhood when she visited her grandmother’s house in Malaysia’s Negeri Sembilan.\n\nThere, she spent endless hours in the backyard, which was full of plants and herbs. She listened carefully when her grandmother explained the benefits of each herb.\n\nAware of the values of biodiversity, and to pursue her love for gardening and growing crops, Mrs Lalithamma rented an 8,000 sq ft plot at Kranji Gallop Farm Resort five years ago. The garden is now home to more than 80 types of herbs, fruits and vegetables.\n\nShe showed me around her backyard plantation and explained almost every crop that was growing there, from brinjal and lady’s fingers to moringa and sugarcane.\n\nThis went on until the milk in the claypot began to boil. Then she asked her friends and family members to gather around the pot.\n\nAs soon as the milk started to boil over, everyone chanted “Pongalo Pongal!” three times – the customary way of expressing gratitude to the sun god for a bountiful harvest and blessed year ahead.\n\nMrs Lalithamma’s eldest son Sivaprasad Pillai, 40, said Pongal celebrations at Kranji are very much close to his heart. Mrs Lalithamma has four children.\n\n“Not everyone is lucky enough to get this organic experience,” he said. “It’s because of my mom that my siblings and relatives are able to indulge in this experience.\n\n“My 11-month-old-baby girl is also here today. She is blessed to have taken part in this celebration.”\n\nWhat followed soon after was a vegetarian lunch feast, prepared by Mrs Lalithamma’s female friend.\n\nA wide array of dishes was served on banana leaves cut from the backyard – mango pickle, carrot raita, sambar, fried baby carrots and boiled chickpeas, to name a few. Sweet pongal rice was also an item.\n\nMr Gunalan Ganesan, who attended the Pongal celebration with his wife and two children, helped Mrs Lalithamma lay out the dishes. “I appreciate auntie for taking this much effort to create an authentic atmosphere for us to celebrate Pongal,” he said.\n\n“It felt like we were celebrating the festival in a garden. My kids would have learnt about Pongal in school, but only initiatives like this can instil the culture and values of the festival in them.”\n\nMrs Lalithamma said: “It’s heartening to see my close friends coming all the way to the Kranji countryside.\n\n“My initiative to raise awareness on organic farming and nature will continue. Though most of my crops were destroyed by the heavy rains over the past few weeks, I did not change anything in my plantation as I wanted to provide a raw experience to those who visit my farm.\n\n“That also represents the hardships farmers face throughout the year, and the importance of celebrating pongal.”\n\nMrs Lalithamma conducts private\n\ntours for people who wish to visit her\n\nplantation.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe current buzz on social media is all about 12th Fail, a low-budget Hindi film that has captured people’s imagination.\n\nGiven the absence of A-list stars in the cast, it is remarkable that the film boasts an impressive 9.2 rating on International Movie Database (IMDb).\n\nReleased in theatres on Oct 27, 12th Fail made its debut on Disney Plus Hotstar on Dec 29, broadening its reach beyond India.\n\nDirected and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the film is based on the true story of Manoj Kumar Sharma, a young man hailing from a financially strained background determined to become an Indian Police Service officer.\n\nHis roots lie in Chambal, a region marked by corruption, even extending to the education system, where cheating in exams is common.\n\nDespite these challenges, Manoj’s father instils in him a commitment to honesty.\n\nTo support his family, Manoj and his brother take up odd jobs, encountering their own set of challenges. However, a chance meeting with an honest police officer becomes a turning point for Manoj, inspiring him to dream big.\n\nWhile a 12th-grade student, Manoj renounces cheating in exams, leading to his failure to progress to the next class – a pivotal moment reflected in the film’s title, 12th Fail.\n\nUndeterred by this setback, he persists and eventually passes the exam through hard work. He heeds his grandmother’s advice and ventures into the city with aspirations of becoming a police officer.\n\nThrough unwavering determination, Manoj navigates various obstacles along the way. The movie reaches its pinnacle with a dramatic interview board incident that would decide his fate.\n\nWhat resonates most with the audience is the film’s powerful message – that a human can triumph over any obstacle through indomitable willpower.\n\nThe on-screen portrayal of Manoj has become a symbol of the dreams and struggles faced by millions of underprivileged jobseekers in India, evoking a profound emotional response from viewers.\n\nVikrant Massey’s portrayal of Manoj is nothing short of brilliant, breathing life into the narrative with his impeccable acting.\n\nMedha Shankar, in the role of Indian Revenue Service officer Shraddha Joshi, Manoj’s lover, adds depth to the storyline.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Anant V Joshi as Pritam Pandey and Priyanshu Chatterjee as Deputy Superintendent of Police Dushyant Singh, also deliver outstanding performances.\n\nBollywood star Alia Bhatt praised the film on Instagram: “One of the most beautiful films I’ve seen in a while! With such fabulous performances. Just too too beautiful!\n\n“Vikrant Massey, you were so spectacular I am in awe! Medha Shankar, the heart and soul of Manoj’s journey, so special and fresh and all things heartwarming! Anantvijay outstanding! And lastly Vidhu Vinod Chopra sir – this film really hits the spot! To the entire cast and crew! Take a bow.”\n\nEarlier this week, actor Hrithik Roshan wrote on X: “Finally saw 12th Fail. It’s a masterclass in filmmaking. Above everything else, I was inspired by the use of sound and sound effects in enhancing the moments. Brilliant performances. Mr Chopra, what a movie! I am deeply inspired by this one.”\n\nFilmmaker Anurag Kashyap wrote a lenghty note praising Chopra’s craft: “Probably the best mainstream film I’ve seen in 2023. @vidhuvinodchoprafilms at the age of 71 has crafted a masterpiece out of a simple story of an adamant man wanting to be more than what life gives him.”\n\nPreviously, Kamal Haasan, Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and others stars also praised the film on social media.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a3cda966254a10a18dea68f4b228c5683d2798a3f56a9390a087708c3276430e?w=825", "alt_text": "Vikrant Massey as the protagonist Manoj Kumar Sharma."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nAfter a three-year closure forced by the pandemic, the famous South Indian food chain Hotel Saravana Bhavan (HSB) is making a re-appearance in Singapore.\n\nFronted by new franchise owners, it will open to the public at Centrium Square in Little India on Jan 23.\n\nBefore the brand’s closure in Oct 2020, following falling sales, it had six outlets in Singapore.\n\n“It was difficult to operate the outlets because manpower was also a problem during the Covid-19 period and for months after the restrictions were lifted,” said Mr Ashok Chawdhary, one of the new franchise owners. “Most F&B businesses suffered.\n\n“Now is a good time to relaunch the brand because people are always on the lookout for good vegetarian options in Singapore, and the manpower situation has eased considerably.\n\n“Saravana Bhavan is No. 1 when it comes to South Indian food, and people here know the brand well.”\n\nThe new outlet, on Centrium Square’s Level 1, has modern furnishing, with a touch of greenery and a high ceiling. It is a spacious 100-seater with an open kitchen and facilities for takeaways.\n\n“We have 550 items on our menu, including the HSB staples,” said Mr Ashok, a PR who is originally from Kolkata. “We have introduced 150 dishes, including Jain specialities, Indo-Chinese fusion, faloodas and smoothies. Alcoholic drinks will also be available.”\n\nThe restaurant will function from 7am to 11pm, with breakfast, lunch and dinner service. “The aim is to attract locals, tourists and corporate clients,” said Mr Ashok.\n\nFive chefs from Tamil Nadu will do the cooking in the traditional HSB style. In all, the restaurant will have 15 staff, including helpers, waiters and managers.\n\n“We know the Indian food market well because we have also been running the Thalappakatti Restaurant in Singapore for six-and-a-half years,” said Mr Ashok, whose businesses with partners encompass F&B, logistics and supply chain management.\n\n“We had manpower issues too at Thalappakatti and faced high costs. But we kept our business going with our delivery service, and now we are much better placed.”\n\nStarted as Thalappakatti Biriyani Hotel in 1957 in Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, by Mr Nagasamy Naidu, the eatery has over the years earned a reputation for its biryani, which has a special blend of spices and sauces.\n\nThe restaurant at Kitchener Road also serves a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.\n\nIn recent years, HSB has introduced innovative dishes to accommodate changing tastes and preferences.\n\nMr Ashok and his partners plan to hitch on to that bandwagon.\n\n“Manpower and supply chain issues still linger, but with the help of the government we hope to overcome them,” said Mr Ashok. “The vegetarian food business in Little India is also highly competitive with several high-quality restaurants. But we are ready for the challenge.\n\n“We use only the best ingredients and stay away from mixing any colours, preservatives or additives.”\n\nAfter they settle down in Little India, Mr Ashok and his team plan to open branches elsewhere in Singapore. They will also look to expand their HSB franchise to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nFounded in 1981 in Chennai, HSB is the largest South Indian restaurant chain in the world. The entity operates in 33 locations in India (24 in Chennai) and 78 across 22 countries in North America, South-east Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Oceania.\n\nIts reputation fell in 2019 after its founder P. Rajagopal, known as Dosa King, was convicted for a murder that took place in 2001.\n\nThe closure of many branches in many countries thereafter was primarily due to the legal issues faced by Rajagopal, who died of a heart attack in July 2019.\n\nThe chain also faced financial challenges and operational issues. But now it appears to be bouncing back.\n\nThe eatery will open at Centrium Square in Little India.\n\nPHOTOS: TABLA\n\n“Saravana Bhavan is No. 1 when it comes to South Indian food, and people here know the brand well.”\n\nMr Ashok Chawdhary (above), one of the new franchise owners.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/56275bddddf8324dd8000bb220c33d6b69a37ab1f5ec052fdd9208da6f3423f3?w=825", "alt_text": "The eatery will open at Centrium Square in Little India."}]}

Iswaran pleaded “not guilty” in court yesterday, after he was dealt 27 charges, mostly related to bribery and corruption, involving more than $384,300.\n\nIn a statement, Iswaran said he rejected the charges and allegations against him.\n\n“I am innocent and will now focus on clearing my name,” wrote the 61-year-old, adding that he will return the salary and Member of Parliament (MP) allowance he received from the start of investigations last July.\n\nHe added: “My family and I decided to return these monies because we believe it is the right thing to do. We cannot in all good conscience keep the monies when I was unable, on account of the investigations, to discharge my duties as a minister and Member of Parliament in that period.”\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a statement yesterday that Iswaran had resigned from the People’s Action Party (PAP) and would be stepping down as transport minister and West Coast GRC MP.\n\nResponding to Iswaran’s resignation letter, PM Lee said he was disappointed and saddened that Iswaran was leaving politics in these circumstances.\n\n“But it is essential that I deal with such matters rigorously in accordance with the law. It is the right thing to do. We must uphold the integrity of the party and the Government. I am sure you understand the importance of doing so. Singaporeans expect no less,” PM Lee said.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the investigations into Iswaran were initiated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and since then the Government has pursued the matter “decisively and proactively”.\n\nOnce CPIB completed its investigations and the public prosecutor assessed the findings independently, they decided to proceed with charges against Iswaran, said DPM Wong.\n\nHe stressed that there was no whistle-blower or tip-off, and that CPIB pursued this matter on its own accord.\n\nThe bureau, he said, did a thorough investigation and left no stone unturned, before presenting its investigation to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC).\n\nIswaran was charged with 24 offences under Section 165 of the Penal Code, two under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and one for obstruction of justice.\n\nSection 165 makes it an offence for a public servant to accept anything of value – without payment or with inadequate payment – from a person who he is involved with in an official capacity.\n\nIt is not necessary to establish that the item of value was received as an inducement or a reward, for it to be deemed an offence.\n\nIswaran was accused of obtaining valuables worth $218,058.95 from managing director of Hotel Properties Limited Ong Beng Seng, a billionaire who gained a high profile for bringing the Formula 1 Grand Prix to Singapore.\n\nHe allegedly did so while knowing that Mr Ong had a connection with his official function as chairman of the F1 Steering Committee.\n\nMr Ong, who is the chairman of race promoter Singapore Grand Prix (SGP) and owns the rights to the race, was arrested on July 11 as part of the corruption probe.\n\nFor the two counts of corruptly obtaining gratification, Iswaran allegedly received about $166,280 worth of event and flight tickets, among other items, in September and December 2022 from Mr Ong. This amount was allegedly as inducement for advancing Mr Ong’s business interests in relation to contracts between the SGP and the Singapore Tourism Board.\n\nIn May 2023, Iswaran allegedly made repayment of $5,700 for a business class flight ticket paid for by Mr Ong in December 2022. This constitutes the single obstruction of justice charge against him.\n\nIswaran, who is represented by Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, is now out on $800,000 bail. A pre-trial conference has been set for March 1.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b5a3680cbc5365cb23e87b7703ff2e0703137045d3a2216cdb9cd083e98c39de?w=825", "alt_text": "S Iswaran fronted by his lawyer Davinder Singh."}]}

He is survived by his 92-year-old wife Surjit Kaur, five children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nHis eldest son Mel Gill, a psychologist, said his father fractured his hip last February after a fall, but “healed sufficiently in three months”. However, his health deteriorated later on owing to renal failure.\n\n“Up until he fractured his hip, he was playing golf three times a week,” said Mel. “He couldn’t have surgery because he had several allergies, but he was a trooper; he ploughed on, and even from his bed at home he was always more concerned about everyone else. That was just how he was.”\n\nSingapore Hockey Federation president Mathavan Devadas, who knew Ajit for more than 50 years, said he was an iconic figure. “He was someone who, even in his 90s, was very active, still playing golf. He would always be available to come for events, to talk to players and share his experiences – he was an inspiration,” said Mathavan.\n\nBorn in Kuala Lumpur in 1928, Ajit was the oldest of 10 siblings and lived through the Japanese occupation in Malaya during World War II.\n\nAs a young athlete, he excelled in hockey and represented Selangor at 17.\n\nHe moved to Singapore in 1951 to enrol in the Teacher’s Training College. Within five years, he donned Singapore’s colours at the Melbourne Olympics, where he and his teammates finished eighth in Singapore hockey’s first and only appearance at the Games.\n\nIn the 1960s, he showed his all-round sporting ability when he swapped his hockey stick for a cricket bat, once again representing Singapore in various international matches.\n\nHis friend, former national hockey player Harbhajan Singh Loomba, 85, who played both hockey and cricket alongside Ajit for the Indian Association, said that, as a teammate, there was no one better than him.\n\n“He was a humble, very friendly person, and I’m happy to have known him for so many years – since 1956 when we were both part of the teachers’ union,” Loomba said.\n\n“He was outstanding in both sports. You couldn’t have asked for a better teammate. He spoke to everyone and always advised the younger players.”\n\nLocal sports enthusiast A. Thiyaga Raju remembers Ajit fondly, as he was a student at Queenstown Secondary School in 1974 when Ajit taught there. The two also kept in touch over the following decades.\n\nMr Raju wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday: “In 2016, when I hosted a surprise birthday party for Mr Ajit at his Teachers’ Housing Estate residence, he excitedly showed me old newspaper cuttings and scrapbooks containing articles on him, and reminisced about his glory days as an Olympian.\n\n“He proudly shared with me that it was in Melbourne during the Games that he bought a proposal ring for his future wife.”\n\nIn his later years, Ajit kept active through golf and race walking. His penchant for winning carried on as he topped the Asean Senior Amateur Golf Championship in 1990. In 2016, he claimed gold in the 5,000m race walk at the Asia Masters Athletics Championships.\n\nAnd in 2010, he was one of the 2,400 torch-bearers – and the oldest – at the Singapore leg of the Youth Olympic Games torch relay.\n\n“He may have been physically old, but mentally, he was sharp,” explained his son Mel when asked how Ajit kept himself active even in his advanced years.\n\n“He had an awesome mindset. He always felt that you could only improve by doing something over and over again. He was a competitor all the way.”\n\nAjit’s other son Phupinder Gill said that of all his father’s accomplishments, making the Olympic grade meant the most to the old man.\n\n“Growing up during that time, when the ruling class was very different from how it is today, making it to the Olympic team was something special to him,” said Phupinder, who is the CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\n“He did it not because he knew someone or anything like that, but because he worked hard. That made him have this philosophy in life to persevere and not to fear anybody.\n\n“Aside from marrying the woman he wanted to, that was his greatest accomplishment.”\n\nFittingly, in 2021, Ajit’s grandson Luc paid tribute to the man in the form of a 225-page biography, The Heart Of An Olympian.\n\nThe book details the journey of Ajit from his younger years during the war, through his stint at the Olympics, to his later sporting accomplishments.\n\nThe book includes a quote from Ajit that reads: “Any man can fight when it feels good, when they’re prepared and when they’re at their best. But what sets a warrior apart from a man is the simple truth that warriors keep fighting, come what may.”\n\n“He had an awesome mindset. He always felt you could only improve by doing something over and over again. He was a competitor all the way.”\n\nMel Gill, on his father Ajit Singh Gill.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0cce6a98c4004d975047b57a3ea382127317b72c1e16ad3c308859007d23b0f6?w=825", "alt_text": "Singapore’s oldest Olympian Ajit Singh Gill, who competed in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, died on Tuesday aged 95 after battling renal failure."}]}

MOHAN\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nWhen a movie celebrates life and the things people do on a daily basis, it’s likely to appeal to audiences for its relatability.\n\nMalayalam filmmakers have identified their viewers well and are making more relatable films that have been earning acclaim.\n\nThough they do not make big money at the box office, Malayalam films are being hailed for their storytelling by several big players in the Indian film industry, including S.S. Rajamouli and Anurag Kashyap.\n\nMalayalee producer R. Mohan, who has produced more than 40 films in Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi and has launched the careers of several actors over the past 35 years, feels the accolades are richly deserved because filmmakers from Kerala “know the pulse of the people”.\n\n“It’s not a new phenomenon,” the 74-year-old, famously known as Goodnight Mohan after a brand of mosquito coil he used to manufacture, told tabla! during a visit to Singapore last week.\n\n“We have been doing good films for ages. The thing is, we visualise correctly and choose subjects that the common man has experienced and can relate to.”\n\nThriller, love story or comedy, Malayalam filmmakers offer a wide range.\n\n“They are also bold,” said Mohan. “No one else in India would think about making a film about the cause of the Nipah virus or the dilemma of a butcher when the buffalo he was supposed to slaughter escapes.\n\n“Superstar Mammootty recently portrayed a man whose wife belatedly realises that he is a homosexual. Which other film industry in India will tackle such a subject? Certainly not Bollywood fielding a big star.\n\n“It’s the strength of the scripts, fine direction and natural acting from the likes of Mohanlal and Mammooty and the crop of young actors, such as Fahadh Faasil, Nivin Pauly, Prithviraj Sukumaran, Dulquer Salmaan and Tovino Thomas – that is behind the success of Malayalam films.”\n\nHowever, Malayalam producers are hesitant to make big-budget movies.\n\n“This is because the market is small, compared to say Hindi films, which 70 per cent of Indians watch,” explained Mohan. “Very few would dare to make a big-budget Malalayam movie because a small hitch would be the ruin of the producer.”\n\nThe 1995 film The King, with a budget of Rs10 crore ($1.6 million), was the first big-budget Malayalam film.\n\nThe 2005 film Rajamanikyam cost Rs25 crore to make. The 2013 film Drishyam touched Rs50 crore and Malaikottai Vaaliban, which stars Mohanlal and will be released this year, is pegged at the same budget.\n\nIn contrast, the Bollywood film Jawan, which starred Shah Rukh Khan, cost Rs300 crore to make.\n\n“It’s not the big stars or lavish sets that matter for Malayalam movies,” said Mohan. “They revolve around simple stuff like happiness, friendship, love, hope, family values, morale. You are bound to love such content.”\n\nMohan, however, has stopped producing Malayalam movies for the past few years for one reason: The attitude of the actors and technicians.\n\n“Before, it was one big family, all working together to make a film,” he said. “Now, people just do their job and leave the set. I don’t like it.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9732f535fc9989f743c97857560df51acb257410f4809842303d43257711697c?w=825", "alt_text": "Malayalam film producer Goodknight Mohan.\n\n\nCredit: COURTESY OF R.

Ganga stood up first to justify her argument that the conduct of youngsters is a blessing.\n\n“The younger generation are taking part in many activities and are tech-savvy. How can we say their conduct is a worry?” she asked.\n\n“Many of them also devote time to volunteering. During the recent Chennai and Thoothukudi floods, it was mostly youngsters who helped rescue families.”\n\nMr Arjun Narayanan, a member of the LISHA Literary club, said the way teenagers carry themselves these days is worrying.\n\n“Before, when you visited someone’s home, the hosts greeted and welcomed you with open arms,” he said. “Now, kids in the house are glued to their handphone screens, and they don’t even bother to look at the guests. This is so shameful.”\n\nWith supporters cheering him on, Mr Arjun continued: “Youngsters now are hooked to social media, which can be a positive or negative influence, but it seems it’s usually the latter.”\n\nLISHA Literary Club’s president Kannan Seshadri said it’s worrying to see teenagers succumb to peer pressure and lose focus in life. “Sometimes, they even take extreme steps,” he added.\n\nMr Ravikumar Balakrishnan, a speaker from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, argued: “Youngsters’ negative attitude and well-being should be attributed to the parents.”\n\nMr Karuppiah shared his thoughts on the topic before giving his judgement.\n\nWhile he agreed youngsters these days are talented and excel in many fields, he also felt they have a penchant for breaking societal norms.\n\n“Although their talents are a blessing, some of their acts are worrying,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/22913874459494e87cf2827833e57e0cae3a301373e20a019ce2771de266f333?w=825", "alt_text": "The debate show organised by LISHA Literary Club."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSumo Didi is the latest sports biopic from India making waves on the international stage, mirroring the success of Dangal, which was championed by Aamir Khan.\n\nFollowing its premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival last November, this biographical drama, which is dedicated to the remarkable journey of India’s first female sumo wrestler Hetal Dave, will be showcased at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in California this week.\n\nDirected by Jayant Rohatgi and written by Nikhil Sachan, the film, which has Shriyam Bhagnani in the lead role, has garnered widespread attention for its unusual subject and narrative.\n\nWhat distinguishes Sumo Didi is its compelling narrative, shedding light not only on an unconventional sport, but also on a woman.\n\nHetal’s extraordinary tale resonates globally for its story of perseverance, and proves how a woman’s body weight isn’t an impediment in realising her dreams.\n\nHer journey from obscurity to international recognition serves as an inspiration for aspiring athletes.\n\n“What drew me to Hetal’s story was her tenacity in breaking through stereotypes, social prejudices, patriarchal mindsets and lack of opportunities,” said Rohatgi. “She chose a sport that did not even exist in India. Her relentless focus and determination made a seemingly impossible dream come true.”\n\nProducer Akash Chawla said: “We came together to bring Hetal’s story to the world because, unlike other sports films, this is a story of human grit where an overweight girl from an Indian middle-class family stands against the objectification of women and instead makes her mark on the global stage in the male-dominated world of sumo wrestling.”\n\nPresented by Jio Studios and produced by Freshlime Films and MA&TH Entertainment, the film has not just earned critical praise, but also sparked a worldwide interest in sumo wrestling and Hetal.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e4460d466b93b55714bfc9e0f088063f10aaec70142c0e71b66dfb19d7de9014?w=825", "alt_text": "Sumo Didi is the latest sports biopic from India that is making waves on the international stage."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA short video on X, posted by the All India Football Federation shows India captain Sunil Chhetri playing keepy-uppy.\n\nAs the striker uses his feet and thighs to keep the ball off the ground, the camera catches the glaring white of floodlights blending with the mellow orange of the setting sun in Doha. The post on the India national team’s official handle is captioned: “What pure joy looks like.”\n\nChhetri is less than seven months from turning 40, and he will be the oldest outfield player in the 2024 Asian Cup, which kicks off in Qatar tomorrow.\n\nNo Indian has ever played in three Asian Cup finals, and no player in this edition has as many goals, 93. Chhetri is also the tournament’s second-most capped player with 145 caps, his international career having begun in 2005.\n\nHe is also a new dad. “You want to be with the kid and mother all the time,” he told The Hindustan Times.\n\nBut he also “wants to do more” on the football pitch.\n\nIndia start their campaign against former champions Australia tomorrow. The target has been set.\n\n“We want to have the biggest underdogs’ result in the first game. No one, not even your friends, is giving you a chance. Imagine, if you get a result against Australia, that is something you are going to die with,” said Chhetri.\n\nIndia began their last Asian Cup campaign in 2019 with a 4-1 win over Thailand, but finished last in the group after narrow losses to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\n\nCoach Igor Stimac has had less than two weeks to prepare the team.\n\nA four-week camp would have been ideal, said Chhetri.\n\n“And a friendly against Iran, or maybe Iraq. If we had played Iran, we would know the tempo expected from Australia.\n\n“Right now, the boys are used to the tempo of the ISL (Indian Super League). Australia are on a different level.”\n\nCroatian Stimac, a former West Ham United defender who was appointed India’s coach in May 2019, warned against big expectations at the Asian Cup.\n\nUnder his guidance, India, a country of more than 1.4 billion people, briefly broke into the top 100 of Fifa’s world rankings for only the second time in nearly three decades. They are now 102nd, a spot below Kosovo, and rank 18th in Asia.\n\n“A giant is definitely out of its slumber now,” declared Stimac, before cautioning: “But I reckon it will take us another four years to enter the top 10 in Asia.”\n\nUnder Stimac, India qualified for the Asian Cup with three wins from three against Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Cambodia, scoring eight times and conceding once as hosts in the third round.\n\nAfter 25th-ranked Australia, they play Uzbekistan and Syria in the group stages.\n\n“We are far from happy with the draw, but it is what it is,” said the 56-year-old Stimac, a member of the Croatia team who finished third at the 1998 World Cup.\n\n“With a very short time for preparation, it’s difficult to expect great things, but my even greater concern are the injuries to some of our key players.”\n\nThis will be India’s fifth Asian Cup. They were runners-up in 1964 in an event that had only four teams. But, apart from that, they have never advanced from the group phase.\n\nIndia lost 3-0 at home to reigning Asian champions Qatar in World Cup qualifying in November. They also suffered friendly defeats by Malaysia and Iraq, before beating Kuwait 1-0 away in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nStimac said more than 20 youngsters have been brought into the squad during his reign “and our supporters are finally enjoying some exciting football”.\n\nBut it is an indication of the limitations of his squad that the ageing skipper Chhetri remains India’s biggest star.\n\nStimac says the forward can bow out at a time of his choosing.\n\n“We are not putting any pressure on him whatsoever; that’s up to him,” said the coach.\n\n“If he keeps enjoying his game with the same hunger and maintaining such brilliant fitness levels, then we are there for him as long as it takes.”\n\nChhetri believes that India’s last few World Cup qualifiers and international friendlies have kicked out the “fear factor” from within the players.\n\n“With this familiarity (of the top teams), the fear factor goes out,” he said. “But I must admit that they (India’s group stage opponents) are extremely good. They’re a couple of levels above what we play in the ISL, but at least we know what we’re up against.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service, AFP\n\n“Right now, the boys are used to the tempo of the Indian Super League.

Santosh Kumar\n\nLove is a universal concept, and has always been important in the canon of art, across art forms, mediums, time and space.\n\nThis is no different in the Indian classical arts.\n\nHowever, love in bharatanatyam is often traversed through only ancient literature, mythology and folklore.\n\nAbhaya’s debut production Love All Around aims to explore the concept of love with experiences that today’s people encounter and relate to, leveraging the nuances of the traditional art form and its vast storytelling potential.\n\nUsing the language of bharatanatyam, the story pivots on one question: What is love?\n\n“Bharatanatyam has limitless storytelling ability, and we’ve taken our first step in trying to tap on this to tell a story that is relatable to today’s generation,” said co-creator and dancer Krithika Soma. “Our aim is to address and encapsulate ideas and notions we have of love – from stereotypes that we have encountered through pop culture and songs to figuring out if we can truly ever grasp what love is in all its magnitude.”\n\nAccording to co-creator and dancer Madhuri Suresh, bharatanatyam has a wide range of vocabulary that can be repurposed to communicate any message.\n\n“The push to use the traditional arts to examine life, for introspection and subsequently catharsis, has begun in selected fields, and we want to advance this meaningful trajectory in Singapore’s local arts scene”, she said.\n\nWith an original concept, choreography and music, Love All Around is a full-length bharatanatyam production.\n\n“All three of us passionately believe in the role love holds in our lives and thus Love All Around came to fruition,” said co-creator and dancer Varsha Vishwanath. “This production is our humble attempt to journey with emotion and take us into spaces we wouldn’t otherwise traverse.\n\n“It has given us space to explore our art form with a new lens, explore our emotions and build camaraderie, making this process intriguing and daunting at times but wholesome.”\n\nV.K.

Motorists will be able to cover the distance between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai in just 20 minutes. It otherwise takes two hours.\n\nCall to ‘shun Maldives’ increases after row over ministers’ comments\n\nA larger number of Indian citizens have called for a boycott of the Maldives after three Maldivian junior ministers mocked India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi early this week.\n\nThe controversy erupted after Mr Modi posted images on X of himself snorkelling and walking along a beach in Lakshadweep, a southern Indian island chain in the Laccadive Sea, off the coast of Kerala.\n\nHe did not mention India’s picturesque neighbour Maldives in his post, but his effusive praise of the beautiful scenery of the lesser-known archipelago was probably seen as a charm offensive to draw people there for vacation rather than the Maldives.\n\nThree Maldives ministers responded to his post, describing Mr Modi as a “clown,” “terrorist” and a “puppet of Israel,” according to Reuters. The Maldives government have suspended the three officials and distanced itself from their comments.\n\nNew York court asks for proof against Indian man in murder case\n\nA New York Court has ordered the federal government to respond to a motion filed by lawyers of Nikhil Gupta seeking material relating to charges against him in a conspiracy to kill a Khalistani proponent on American soil.\n\nFederal prosecutors have charged that Indian national Gupta was working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds both US and Canada citizenship.\n\nGupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic at the request of the US and is in a jail in Prague.\n\nFour men go missing in Manipur, fresh firing reported\n\nFour men from Manipur’s Kumbi assembly constituency, who had gone out to collect firewood near the hill ranges adjoining Bishnupur and Churachandpur districts, went missing on Wednesday, police said.\n\nSources told NDTV that the possibility of Mr Dara Singh, Mr Ibomcha Singh, Mr Romen Singh and Mr Anand Singh being held captive by militants cannot be ruled out, and help from central forces have been sought.\n\nMilitants also reportedly launched fresh gun and bomb attacks at Haotak village in Bishnupur district forcing more than 100 women, children and elderly to flee to safer areas.\n\nSupreme Court quashes release of men in Muslim woman’s gang-rape\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday quashed the release of 11 Hindu men who had been jailed for life for gang-raping a pregnant Muslim woman and murdering her relatives during Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002.\n\nThe court directed the men to surrender to the prison authorities within two weeks.\n\nThe victim, Ms Bilkis Bano, was three months pregnant when she was gang-raped.\n\nThe men, convicted in early 2008, were freed by the Gujarat government in August 2022 after the prison they were being held in recommended their release considering the time served and their good behaviour.\n\nGovernment to ‘take action’ after completing cough syrup probe\n\nThe Central government will take “appropriate action” after completing an investigation into a complaint that a drug regulator helped switch samples of cough syrup linked to the death of children in Gambia in return for a bribe, two officials told Reuters.\n\nThe World Health Organisation linked the syrups made by Indian company Maiden Pharmaceuticals to the deaths of 70 children in 2022, though the Indian government said subsequent tests at an Indian government laboratory showed the syrups were not toxic.\n\nMaiden, whose factory is based in Haryana, denies wrongdoing.\n\nDelhi’s drainage system ‘pathetic’, observes High Court\n\nThe drainage system in the national capital is “absolutely pathetic” and in a “very bad state of affairs”, the Delhi High Court observed on Wednesday while asking authorities to wake up and act against the problem of waterlogging.\n\nThe High Court also said the agencies connected with water drainage cannot be ordered to set things right, and that the reform has to come from within.\n\nIndia’s purchases of discounted Russian crude reach 11-month low\n\nIndia’s purchase of discounted Russian crude oil has fallen to an 11-month low with the rise in prices, AFP reported, citing figures from global energy trade intelligence platform Kpler.\n\nIndia had continued to purchase Russian oil even after Western sanctions on Russia and had made it clear it would make decisions according to its national interests.\n\nHowever, the oil purchase has fallen after production cuts from OPEC+ and increased demand from China jacked up prices.\n\nKpler reported that refiners in India purchased 1.45 million barrels per day of Russian oil last month. This is the lowest figure since last January.\n\nCourt allows Jet Airways founder to meet ailing wife at Mumbai home\n\nA special court in Mumbai on Wednesday permitted Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal, an accused in the alleged defrauding of Rs538 crore ($86.2 million) from Canara Bank, to meet his ailing wife tomorrow on humanitarian grounds.\n\nHe has also been allowed to consult his private doctors for multiple ailments.\n\nThe order came days after Goyal told the court he had “lost every hope of life”, and it would be “better if he died in jail” than living in such a situation.\n\nHe said he was badly missing his wife, who is in the last stages of cancer.\n\nAccused arrested 13 years after chopping off professor’s palm\n\nThe main accused in a case related to the chopping of a Kerala professor’s palm was arrested by the National Investigation Agency on Monday, 13 years after the crime.\n\nSavad, who was an activist of the banned Popular Front of India, chopped off the right palm of Professor T.J.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nAmmakase is an Indian interpretation of the Japanese omakase concept, where you place your trust in the chef’s skills to create a personalised meal.\n\nSingapore’s first such restaurant, a 50 seater which opened at One Raffles Place last month, features traditional recipes from India’s coastal states and Sri Lanka.\n\nPassed down the ages by ammas (mothers), the dishes are prepared using modern techniques, with influences from Japan, France, Italy, South Korea and other Asian cuisines.\n\nThe menu has been created by noted chef Abhijit Saha, who runs the award-winning restaurants Caperberry and Fava in Bengaluru and was the force behind the Michelin recommended Indian restaurant Saha in Singapore from 2014 to 2017.\n\n“I am a foodie, like shareholder M. Rajaram (from K&L Gates Straits Law),” said Mr J.K. Saravana, a media, advertising and food and beverage entrepreneur who came up with the idea of starting Ammakase with some family members and business partners. “We love fine dining, but found that Indian restaurants in Singapore could not provide what we were craving for. So, we decided to fine-tune the omakase concept and came up with dishes that we like and felt would also be relished by discerning eaters.”\n\nHe calls Ammakase a fine dining experience in a concrete jungle.\n\n“It’s a culinary journey,” he said. “Everyone who comes here gets to taste authentic Indian flavours.\n\n“Indian restaurants don’t use duck, but we do. We don’t serve Wagyu beef or Iberico pork, but we have high-value ingredients such as lobsters, caviar and salmon roe. Most of our meats are grown in a farm in Yio Chu Kang.\n\n“Our team makes sure everything is perfect, including the food coming out at the right temperature.”\n\nAmmakase’s pan-seared garam masala duck is a hit. So too the Sri Lankan curried prawns, mussels and clam soup, grilled Pacific rock lobster, tandoori-spiced seabass and venison briyani.\n\n“The food is excllent,” said lawyer Joan Lim-Casanova, who was at Ammakase for lunch with her colleagues. “I don’t like spicy food, so they toned it down for me. The ingredients used have fine flavours.”\n\nBusinessman Madhu Gopinath loved the presentation. “We don’t know what will be served. There are a few surprise elements which add to the fun,” he said. “The wine and whisky pairing lifts the quality of the dishes.”\n\nAmmakase has a sommelier and mixologist to offer suggestions.\n\n“The menu for each person is customised and curated separately,” said Mr Saravana. “That’s not an experience you find in Indian restaurants in Singapore. We change the menu every month. So, a lot of effort goes into what we create and serve.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1632488b3acc6e299af5de15cb456caa190659bb055745474fd8b310e535dc74?w=825", "alt_text": "Ammakase is an Indian interpretation of the Japanese omakase concept."}]}

She revealed that the wedding was near a hospital.\n\nThe clip featured her and several other people dancing in a “silent baraat” with music playing on their wireless headphones. There was no DJ and no loud drum beats, just people grooving to music playing on headphones.\n\nIt was a nod to the “silent disco” concept, according to her. It is a fairly new, coming-of-age concept in which people dance to music playing on wireless headphones, and where others are not disturbed by the loud music.\n\n“Never thought I’d be attending an Ae Dil Hai Mushkil DJ party. Would you ever wish to be a part of such a party?” she wrote while sharing the video, referencing the silent disco of the “break-up song” used in the film.\n\nSince then, the post has accumulated more than 19 million views and over 736,000 likes.\n\nIn the comments section, while some cheered for the innovative twist, others said they were “not interested” in such kind of baraat.\n\n“This is a nice idea... Other people will also not be disturbed,” wrote one user. “Very good initiative,” said another.\n\nHowever, one user said: “That’s so awkward for the viewers. Are they mad? They’re dancing without music.”\n\n“Someone as wild as me would end up breaking the headphones,” said another.\n\nEarlier, a video of another unique baraat had also made the rounds on the Internet.\n\nA groom in Bengaluru decided to ditch the ceremonial horse and car, and instead opted for an electric scooter. An Instagram page called Traaexplore Weddings shared the video and wrote: “Baraat on Yulu bike. Bangalore.”\n\nThe video amassed more than 42,000 likes and hundreds of comments.\n\nWhile many Instagram users loved the eco-friendly and unique concept, some were not onboard citing traffic issues, among other things.

He was, though, handed visitation rights.\n\nPolice believe this upset Suchana enough to plan the murder.\n\nThe police found empty cough syrup bottles in her hotel room in Goa’s Candolim and believe she gave the child a heavy dose, making him drowsy, and then smothered him with a pillow.\n\nIn an earlier interrogation, Suchana, in police custody till next week, said she had no idea how her son died, insisting he was alive when she went for a nap and dead when she woke up. A senior police officer dismissed the explanation, telling news agency PTI: “We don’t buy her theory.”\n\nThe post-mortem indicated the boy was smothered.\n\nSuchana checked into a service apartment at the Sol Banyan Grande on Friday with her son, and checked out two days later without him but with a large brown bag.

Santosh Kumar\n\nANUSHA SELVAMANI\n\nI vividly remember those days. Whenever I went to Little India, there would be an old man sitting in a corner at Tekka Market next to a small green parrot inside a cage.\n\nFast-forward two decades, and that man can’t be found in Little India or in any other enclave in Singapore. Parrot astrology is very much a thing of the past.\n\nSo, it was heartening to bump into Mr Selvaraju Muniyandi last month, who claims to be Singapore’s last parrot astrologer.\n\n“I don’t think many people would even know parrot astrologers exist in Singapore,” said the 53-year-old in Tamil.\n\nI caught Mr Selvaraju in his act at a booth in Birch Road during the Great Indian Food Festival. As a crowd watched, he told his parrot: “Letchumi, can you pick a card for our customer?”\n\nLetchumi, Mr Selvaraju’s sidekick for the last 20 years, slowly emerged from her cage and picked a fortune card from a deck of 27.\n\n“Each of the cards represent a Hindu deity and the message in it will address the person’s current state, be it positive or negative,” explained Mr Selvaraju.\n\nThe customer Thashayani Priya, a 19-year old student, was happy with what the card read. “It is positive and a good start for me,” she said.\n\n“I used to see parrot astrologers when I was very young. I was surprised to see there was still someone doing this in Singapore. I do believe in it as my family members love to consult astrologers.”\n\nMr Selvaraju, a full-time security officer, conducts the readings in public on an ad-hoc basis. Occasionally, his regular customers visit his house for a reading.\n\n“I am doing this as a side business,” he said. “If I was doing only parrot astrology, it would be difficult for me to support a wife and three children.”\n\nAt events, he does not charge individuals, but organisers have to pay him $250 for an hour and $150 for each subsequent hour.\n\nOriginally from Ipoh in Malaysia, Mr Selvaraju packed his bags for Singapore when he was 18. Here, he worked as a prata maker, before deciding to do something on his own.\n\nHaving learnt the art of teh tarik pulling and making kacang puteh from his uncle, he opened his own kacang puteh stall at Tekka Mall, now Tekka Place. He ran the small business for five years.\n\nDuring that time, he met an elderly parrot astrologer in Little India with whom he struck up a conversation.\n\n“I used to meet him every day,” Mr Selvaraju said. “I can’t even recall his name now, but we became friends. I began to admire his passion for the craft, and developed a liking for his parrot Letchumi, who is with me now.”\n\nMr Selvaraju then began learning about parrot astrology from the old man. “I found parrot astrology peculiar,” he said. “How could a bird predict so accurately?”\n\nHis kacang puteh business came to a halt when Tekka Mall underwent a renovation. “I frantically searched for another place to set up my stall, but I had little money and rents were high. I felt directionless.\n\n“After the old man’s demise, I decided to do parrot astrology full-time as I did not want the craft to vanish. I embraced Letchumi into my life.”\n\nLetchumi is 21 years old now, and Mr Selvaraju is hoping to find another parrot who can deal in astrology.\n\n“I want to bring another parrot either from Malaysia or India, but it’s a challenge,” he said. “I have to make sure that Letchumi stays healthy. I feed her food that does not contain oil or salt.”\n\nAccording to Mr Selvaraju, “parrot astrology does not predict everything that will happen in a person’s life”.\n\n“People can try it out if they feel down and want to get a clear direction,” he said. “Those who are sceptical about it should not try it out as they will not believe the message.”\n\nMr Selvaraju wants younger people in Singapore to learn the craft. He has introduced parrot astrology techniques to his three children, and his eldest son usually accompanies him to events.\n\n“I have to introduce it to my children as I’m afraid that after me, the art will die in Singapore,” he said. “We should not just let it go like that. I make sure that my children are aware about this.”\n\nAs I wrapped up my conversation with Mr Selvaraju, an old lady approached the booth.\n\n“Oh my! It has been very long since I saw a parrot astrologer in Singapore,” she remarked. “I really miss those days when I used to see a parrot astrologer at Tekka. This feels so nostalgic.”\n\nMadam Jeyakodi Naidu, 72, then handed a $10 note to Selvaraju and asked him for a reading.\n\nLetchumi stepped out from her cage and selected a card using her orange beak. It had a photo of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and fortune.\n\n“So happy to receive a positive sign today,” said Madam Jeyakodi. “I know parrot astrology never goes wrong.”\n\n“I have to introduce it to my children as I’m afraid that after me, the art will die in Singapore.”\n\nParrot astrologer \nSelvaraju Muniyandi", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2ac2bf88d94bca645c9ae5bea04caba4b21c8d6513d9c4df9cb7e37865c99d86?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Selvaraju Muniyandi with his parrot Letchumi."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nTeacher-turned-filmmaker Reena Deen has completed filming Singapore’s first low-budget indie horror film starring disabled leads using her own savings.\n\nThe 75-minute supernatural mystery, The Damned Ones, features actresses who are hard of hearing and blind.\n\nA mini-documentary by Reena on how this feature film was made received an award from Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng on Nov 5.\n\nIt also won third place at last month’s Pokka Film Festival, a platform for emerging filmmakers to showcase their work in Singapore.\n\nThe documentary talks about how the cast and crew, who either have disabilities or come from marginalised backgrounds, teamed up to shoot the movie.\n\nHaving grown up with Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) and dyslexia, Reena is no stranger to the challenges faced by people with disabilities.\n\n“I wanted to tell a story with disabled leads which did not revolve around disability,” she said.\n\nThe filmmaker put up a casting and crew notice in the Kino Red Dot WhatsApp group, an amateur film club in Singapore where people come together to make short films as a hobby.\n\n“Jade Ow, an actress who is hard of hearing, approached me saying she was keen to play the lead,” said Reena. “She then brought in her friend Amanda Yip, an actress who is legally blind, to play the second lead.\n\n“The other cast and crew also came mainly through Kino Red Dot, and I chose people who I knew were talented but could not find an opportunity because of disability or marginalisation.”\n\nReena decided to do the film with her own savings, about $7,000, because she felt that, as a new director with only short films under her belt, it would be hard to get funding.\n\n“Most people would baulk at the idea of using their savings for something like this, but for me it was an amazing learning experience and I have no regrets,” she said.\n\nReena, who was a teacher for 15 years, had not planned to become a filmmaker. However, when the pandemic struck in 2020, her income was affected as she was teaching mostly children with learning difficulties and online tuition was not suitable for them.\n\nShe chose to upgrade herself with the SGUnited Skills writing course from Singapore Media Academy (SMA) and initially planned to use it to teach English to adults. However, the course, which included scriptwriting, ignited her passion for filmmaking.\n\n“I was motivated by SMA vice-president Timothy Tan, who talked about filmmaking in our class,” she said. “He made me feel like some day my scripts could be made into films.\n\n“A course member took me to Kino Red Dot meetings where I met the founder, Alexandre Fernandez. He strongly believes the film industry needs more female directors and persuaded me to learn filmmaking.\n\n“I then learnt filmmaking from Kino Red Dot members who taught me different skills, such as cinematography, lighting and sound.”\n\nThough the script for The Damned Ones was written by Reena, Jade and Amanda provided inputs to ensure that the disability representation was as accurate as possible.\n\n“As a deaf actress, I strongly believe that the whole community must come together to facilitate accessibility in the arts,” said Jade. “I am not exempt from the intense training and preparation for a role. This is just the beginning, and I hope to deliver much more in future.”\n\nAmanda said: “I play a character who is legally blind like me, but unlike me she is feisty and strong-willed. As a newbie to the filmmaking space, it really tested my acting skills.”\n\nReena hopes to get some assistance with the post-production work for her film, but she is fully prepared to invest her own time and money if necessary.\n\n“The film underwent a final edit, thanks to an editor who kindly volunteered her time for minimal pay,” she said. “However, to compete in reputable film festivals like the Singapore International Film Festival, the film will need professional audio and colour grading. I am applying for grants to get these done.”\n\nShe plans to send the film to film festivals in Singapore, Busan, Shanghai and Hong Kong this year.\n\n“The only way I can do justice to my cast and crew who have poured in so much time and effort is to take this film to the festivals which will recognise their talent,” said Reena.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a5a6ef360be4496649c108be617428fe0ba2056bdca05fa230bb1f4ac2a454b1?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nANUSHA SELVAMANi\n\nMalaysia is popular for its plethora of food options, and it is normal for Singaporeans to go there to enjoy the tasteful and cheap fare.\n\nEarly last year, a nasi lemak dish made by an Indian woman became all the rage in the country.\n\nPeople queued for hours at Akka Nasi Lemak in Seri Kembangan, a town in Selangor district, and her story went viral on social media.\n\nThe very same nasi lemak, according to Ms Sangeetha Manimalar, the brain behind the venture, has garnered a similar following in Singapore shores.\n\nIn November, the 34-year-old allowed Singaporean entrepreneur Amos Pushpanathan to start a franchise stall here – and it’s been doing well.\n\n“I am grateful for the support my customers have given me, and I am happy that people in Singapore are loving my nasi lemak,” she told tabla!\n\nMr Amos, 34, who is also in the alcohol business, said it took him nearly six months to convince Ms Sangeetha to grant him permission.\n\n“Often, my business partners and I would deliver alcohol to customers in Malaysia late at night, after which we don’t (always) find a good supper place,” he said. “Then I heard about Akka Nasi Lemak, and headed to Selangor to try it.\n\n“I love good food – but I also had business intentions. I ordered all her dishes as I wanted to find out whether Singaporeans would like them or not. And I was impressed.”\n\nMr Amos said he was hooked to the nasi lemak because “the combination of Indian spices and coconut rice made it really tasty”.\n\n“The chicken is tender, and the pairing with crunchy onions and the flavourful sambal made the experience wholesome,” he said.\n\n“My favourite used to be the Chinese nasi lemak sold in Chong Pang (in Sembawang Road). But Sangeetha’s nasi lemak has beaten it comfortably.”\n\nMr Amos’ initial pitch to start an Akka Nasi Lemak franchise in Singapore did not find favour with Ms Sangeetha.\n\n“She turned down my offer, and it took me six months of constant cajoling before she finally said okay.”\n\nMs Sangeetha said she was initially sceptical because she did not know much about the food and beverage scene in Singapore. “Amos convinced me that this expansion will take my brand to greater heights,” she said. “I then finally agreed.”\n\nSince November, people in Singapore have been placing orders for Akka Nasi lemak through local food delivery platforms or picking them up from Smart City Kitchens – a central kitchen facility – in Sembawang.\n\n“The chefs are trained by Sangeetha herself and the dishes are prepared in a central kitchen,” said Mr Amos.\n\n“For customers keen to dine in, there’s good news: We are planning to open a stall by early February, and Sangeetha will be coming to Singapore.”\n\nMs Sangeetha said her nasi lemak is prepared from a secret recipe passed down from her grandfather and mother-in-law’s mother.\n\nIt has the usual white coconut rice or pandan green rice as the base, and a wide range of accompanying dishes such as chicken rendang, chicken sambal, chicken kicap, ikan bilis sambal, sotong sambal, mutton rendang and sambal petai.\n\nThere are vegetarian options too, like mee hoon goreng, mee goreng and thosai.\n\n“My nasi lemak stands out because of the sambal paste. It comes in spicy and non-spicy options,” said Ms Sangeetha. “Some customers have even suggested I sell the sambal paste in bottles.”\n\nHousewife S. Rathinam said her daughter introduced her to Akka Nasi Lemak.\n\n“I love the balance of flavours in the dish,” said the 54-year-old. “I really liked the spicy sambal and sweetness in the chicken kicap.”\n\n“My favourite used to be the Chinese nasi lemak sold in Chong Pang. But Sangeetha’s nasi lemak has beaten it comfortably.”\n\nMr Amos Pushpanathan, who runs the franchise here.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/23b580d132ca5377446203abda09941f640b2923df238bcf6790afb3c6c86a3e?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Sangeetha Manimalar at her stall in Selangor."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe deaths of a wealthy Indian-origin couple and their daughter in the United States’ Massachusetts last week have been ruled a murder-suicide by medical authorities after the autopsies.\n\nMr Rakesh Kamal, 57, his wife Teena, 54, and their daughter Arianna, 18, were found dead in their US$5 million ($6.65 million) mansion in Dover, a suburb of Boston, on Dec 28. A firearm was found near Mr Kamal.\n\nNorfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey said autopsy results confirm that Ms Teena and Miss Arianna were victims of homicide by gunshot.\n\nMr Rakesh died from a “gunshot wound consistent with being self-inflicted”. The final autopsy report is likely to be completed in the coming weeks.\n\nA statement further said that while full forensic and ballistics testing of the gun has not been done, the firearm is consistent with a .40 calibre Glock 22. However, it was not registered in Mr Rakesh’s name and “he was not licensed to possess it”.\n\nLast week, Mr Morrissey said the initial investigation indicated it was a case of domestic violence and did not indicate the involvement of outside parties.\n\nDover Police received an emergency call from a relative who had stopped by to check on the family on Dec 28, after not hearing from them for two days.\n\nThe police found the Kamal family dead when they arrived at the scene. Mr Morrissey said there had been no previous police reports or domestic incidents tied to the home.\n\nThe slain family members were the only ones living in the mansion, the DA said, adding that the area, one of the richest in the state, was a “safe community”.\n\nThe family’s sprawling mansion went into foreclosure a year ago and was sold for US$3 million, according to a report in The New York Post.\n\nThe Kamals purchased the 19,000 sq ft estate, which boasts 11 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, for US$4 million in 2019, according to media reports.\n\n“That foreclosure occurred after the parties had already attempted some sort of modification of their mortgage, which suggests they were having financial difficulty for quite some time,” legal analyst Jennifer Roman told CBS Boston.\n\n“It’s not unusual that they were still in the home, but the property was definitely no longer in their names.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s quite common where a family is having financial distress and one of the family members ends up taking the lives of their family and then themselves.”\n\nThe couple had previously run an education systems company called EduNova, which was launched in 2016 and was dissolved in December 2021.\n\nOnline records show that the family appeared to have faced financial problems in recent years.\n\nMs Teena filed for bankruptcy in September 2022, listing between US$1 million and US$10 million in liabilities.\n\nThe case, however, was dismissed two months later due to insufficient documentation. She was listed as one of the board of directors for the American Red Cross of Massachusetts.\n\nThe couple’s daughter was a student at Middlebury College, a US64,800-a-year private liberal arts school in Vermont, where she was studying neuroscience, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0ddde01ccd3d7a2c7f1b3f44242ca40d53a39c2109df17b6ee7a432b71ae1fa3?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTamil actor Vijay Sethupathi has achieved fame for brilliantly portraying negative roles in movies, and will appear as a mysterious character opposite Katrina Kaif in Merry Christmas, scheduled for release on Jan 12.\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with Pinkvilla, the 45-year-old revealed that he was tired of playing the villain.\n\n“I thought playing a villain gives (actors) so much freedom. You can have fun with the role – because it’s not something you can be in real life,” he said.\n\n“But slowly, I couldn’t handle it. I got a little confused. Many people began approaching me to do villain roles, and it became an emotional block.\n\n“I decided to stop and relax. Later, I will decide if I really want to do it again.”\n\nIn Merry Christmas, directed by Sriram Raghavan, Sethupathi plays the hero. The film, made simultaneously in Hindi and Tamil, also stars Tinnu Anand, Sanjay Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Pratima Kannan, Radhika Apte and Ashwini Kalsekar.\n\nThe trailer reveals that the story unfolds on Christmas Eve. Katrina and Sethupathi decide to spend the evening together, and then the night takes a dark and ominous turn.\n\nRaghavan said he initially considered Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan for the role, but opted for Sethupathi because the Tamil actor was proficient in Hindi. He also wanted a fresh pairing.\n\nSethupathi told The Indian Express he didn’t speak much with Katrina during filming because he was “afraid” of her.\n\n“I am new to (Bollywood). She is well experienced; a big star here,” he said.\n\nBut the pair reportedly had good chemistry on set.\n\nIn another interview with Mashable India, Sethupathi opened up about his initial days in the Tamil film industry.\n\n“My story is very short,” he said. “I needed to support my family and took up a job as an accountant in a cement distribution company in Chennai.\n\n“Then, between 2000 and 2003, I went to Dubai to work. I came back to Chennai, got married to Jessie (with whom he has two children) and started an interior decoration business, which bombed.\n\n“I was very shy and an introvert. I decided to take up acting as a career to kill my shy nature.”\n\nHe found a job as an accountant in a theatre company called Koothu-P-Pattarai, where he started observing the making of plays and the magic of theatre enchanted him.\n\n“I had no real ambitions or direction in life,” Sethupathi said. “All I wanted was to build a home, own a car and have the ability to repay loans faster.\n\n“I didn’t think there was more to life than that.”\n\nSo, when someone told him he could earn up to Rs5,000 ($80) a day acting in teleserials, he decided to give it a shot.\n\nIn retrospect, Sethupathi said that had he known about the struggles in making it big in the film industry, fear would have probably deterred him from trying.\n\n“Sometimes, innocence is a blessing,” he said. “I did not know anything about films or acting. And that became my strength.”\n\nNot much is known about Merry Christmas, as the makers have revealed very little about the film. But going by the trailer, Raghavan appears to have put his signature spin on the traditional structure of romance, as suspense, seduction and surprise await the audience.\n\nSethupathi believes it is a refreshing movie, and bound to impress the audience.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“Many people began approaching me to do villain roles, and it became an emotional block.”\n\nTamil actor \nVijay Sethupathi", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/af4e55b7dcec57e956a5aaa28095aaeefeebbdad671d48f059ed325bba9f653c?w=825", "alt_text": "Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi in Merry Christmas."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMore than 60 people from Gujarat on board the Nicaragua-bound plane that was sent back from France over suspected human trafficking, had agreed to pay about Rs8 million ($130,000) each to immigration agents. The agents had apparently promised to get them into the United States illegally after reaching the Latin American country, officials told NDTV.\n\nThe Legend Airlines aircraft, an Airbus A340 carrying 303 passengers including 260 Indians, had taken off from Fujairah International Airport in the United Arab Emirates on Dec 21.\n\nWhen the plane stopped at Vatry Airport in Paris for refuelling, it was grounded by police based on an anonymous tip-off that it could be carrying human trafficking victims.\n\nAfter a four-day grounding, it landed in Mumbai in the early hours of Dec 26.\n\nAccording to Superintendent of Police (Crime Investigation Department) Sanjay Kharat, among the passengers were 66 Gujarat natives, including some children. They were mostly from Mehsana, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Anand districts.\n\n“We have already questioned 55 of them,” he told NDTV. “Each of them admitted that they had agreed to pay up to Rs80 lakh to local immigration agents to help them cross into the US illegally after reaching Nicaragua via Dubai.”\n\nThe state CID is questioning 15 agents, who allegedly promised to help the 55 enter the US illegally through the Mexico border.\n\n“These agents had asked the 55 persons to pay the money only after reaching the US, and that their men would take them to the US,” said SP Kharat. “The agents had also booked the air tickets and gave up to US$3,000 to each passenger to deal with any emergency situation.”\n\nThe CID is collecting more information about how the agents operated – such as how they acquired Dubai and Nicaragua visas, their bank details and who booked the flight tickets from Dubai.\n\n“The CID wants to take action against the agents who had promised to help the victims enter the US and other countries illegally. We have formed four teams which will get information from the victims regarding the promises made to them by these agents,” SP Kharat said.\n\n“We want to know how these people came into contact with the agents, or whether the agents contacted them. We have identified people who could give us information into the illegal racket, and they are being questioned.”\n\nFlights to Nicaragua or Third World countries where obtaining travel documents is relatively easy, are now known in India as “Dunki” or “Donkey” flights.\n\nIn a sheer coincidence, the grounding of the Legends Airlines aircraft took place on Dec 21, the same day the Bollywood movie Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Taapsee Pannu, was released.\n\nThe film deals with illegal migration, and revolves around a group of friends attempting to reach the United Kingdom through a “donkey route”.\n\nNicaragua has become a popular destination for those seeking asylum in the US. Gujarat CID’s investigations have revealed that two other “Donkey” flights involving people from the state were arranged from Dubai on Dec 6 and Dec 19.\n\nThe same agents, who are being questioned for the flight via France, were involved,” said SP Kharat.\n\nAs many as 96,917 Indians attempted to enter the US illegally in 2023, signalling a 51.61 per cent jump from the previous year, according to data made available by the US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).\n\nAt least 41,770 of those Indians attempted to enter the US via the Mexican land border, CBP data shows.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“We want to know how these people came into contact with the agents, or whether the agents contacted them.”\n\nSuperintendent of Police Sanjay Kharat", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1d3f4a35f739b3cf8bb8883d7c944c9c0aff1e36ca2c636741468a5f0d956df8?w=825", "alt_text": "Passengers from Nicaragua bound Airbus A340 flight that was grounded in France on suspicion of human trafficking, leave the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport after their arrival in Mumbai."}]}

Did she scribble down on some paper: “Break records, strike gold at the Asian Games and basically have the greatest individual year in Singapore track and field history”?\n\nIf she did, she can now put a checkmark next to those entries.\n\nThe sprint queen gave Singapore sports fans much to shout about with her gold rush (five in three competitions), culminating in a stunning finale in Hangzhou, China, where she ended Singapore’s 49-year wait for a track and field gold at the Asian Games by claiming the women’s 200m crown.\n\nStrangely however, aside from Shanti, there wasn’t much to shout about in terms of Indian athletes, at least not on the surface.\n\nHere’s a startling stat: Over the last 28 years, from Atlanta 1996 right down to Tokyo 2020, 141 athletes have represented Singapore on the Olympic stage. Only three of them were Indians – Shanti and fencer Amita Berthier (in 2020) and hurdler Dipna Lim Prasad (2012).\n\nSure, ultimately, we compete under the Singapore flag and not a Singapore-Indian one, but the question – where have all the Indian athletes gone? – is a fair one when you think about our sporting history and the days when this country produced track stars such as sprinter C. Kunalan and long-distance runner K. Jayamani, as well as celebrated footballers S. Rajagopal, V. Sundramoorthy, and national captain Terry Pathmanathan, not to mention Olympic boxer Syed Abdul Kadir.\n\nRight now, beyond Shanti, no one else appears to be a proverbial torchbearer.\n\nThere are, however, a few “wonderkids” down the pipeline; a few youngsters poised to burst onto the scene.\n\nIn athletics, there is Marc Brian Louis – the son of a Tamil father and Filipina mother – who ran 10.27s in the 100m at the recent Asian Games to eclipse U.K. Shyam’s long-standing national record of 10.37s set in 2001.\n\nAfter battling injuries the last couple of years, Marc has been going from strength to strength. He began his track career as a hurdler and offered a glimpse of his talent early on when he won an historic gold for Singapore at the 2019 Asian Youth Championships in the 400m hurdles. Last year, he clinched the 100m silver at the SEA Games and the Asian Athletics Championships.\n\nAs far as records go, Danisha Mathialagan raised a few eyebrows when she became the first Singaporean boxer to qualify for the Asian Games since 1976.\n\nThe feat surprised many, as the 25-year-old painfully missed out on the last two SEA Games – she missed the 2023 edition after her light flyweight category (50kg) was cancelled.\n\nMulling retirement from the sport, Danisha fought on, and in 2022, defeated Madeleine Bowen, Australia’s No. 1 boxer in the 48kg class.\n\nWhile her debut at the Asiad resulted in defeat in the round of 16, Danisha, who is a full-time student at the Singapore Institute of Technology, is aiming to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics. If she makes it, she’ll become the first Singaporean on that stage since Syed Abdul Kadir competed in Munich in 1972.\n\nThere’s also Amita who now sports a tattoo of the Olympic rings on her left forearm, after her maiden Olympics in Tokyo. The 22-year-old is eyeing a more valuable memento in 2024: her first Olympic medal.\n\nAs far as team sports are concerned, netball player Amandeep Kaur Chahal was a lynchpin in the Singapore side that triumphed at last year’s Nations Cup, emerging as one of the Republic’s top scorers in the tournament.\n\nMounisha Devi Manivannan should also be given credit for her performances with the women’s water polo team who surprised many at the recent SEA Games, where they bagged a silver medal.\n\nYes, Indians have finally made a splash in the pool. And, standing at just 1.57m, Mounisha, rather remarkably, plays as the team’s goalkeeper.\n\n“Indian girls in Singapore rarely take up water polo” she once admitted, but the trailblazing Mounisha is a story of sheer dedication and grit. A third-year medical student at NUS, she says she makes up for her lack of height and wingspan with “stronger legs and faster reaction time”, working on those attributes constantly during training.\n\nWhile all that’s well and good, what about football – the country’s national sport?\n\nIn recent times, the national side has been devoid of Indian footballers, save for captain Hariss Harun, now in his twilight years, and midfielder M. Anumanthan.\n\nAnd, while there’s a young prospect in national Under-23 forward Nicky Melvin Singh, the lack of Indian footballers in the pipeline is salient.\n\nBut that might change in a few years.\n\nHalfway across the world, in Madrid, Spain, two young footballers are currently living the dream.\n\nKyen and Tylan Sasikumar, whose father is former Singapore defender R. Sasikumar, have been impressing many at the prestigious Atletico Madrid academy since last October.\n\nThe boys – Kyen is 12, Tylan is 10 – had shown a keen interest in football since young. From kickabouts at an open space in their Jalan Tua Kong condominium, both brothers progressed to organised training with the ActiveSG academy before joining the youth teams of local side Lion City Sailors.\n\nWhen dad Sasi moved to Spain for work, he reached out to various La Liga clubs, and soon, Atletico offered a two-week trial to the brothers.\n\nThe club, it seems, have liked what they’ve seen so far. An Atletico academy spokesman told The Straits Times that Kyen’s best attributes are his speed and scoring ability, while Tylan is a “good dribbler” with a “very powerful shot”.\n\nWhile Sasi is quick to temper expectations all around, he says his sons do share a dream of becoming professional footballers.\n\nCome July, when the Summer Olympics in Paris rolls around, Singaporeans will be reminded that Shanti faces a tall order.\n\nThough she hasn’t explicitly stated her targets in Paris, her aim, many would argue, would be to qualify for the final in her 200m pet event. That goal would require her to better her personal best time of 22.57s by 0.18s – at least. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the slowest qualifying time for the final eight sprinters was 22.40s.\n\nBut would you dare write the Singaporean sprint queen off? Maybe she’ll produce another banner year on the track.\n\nOr maybe Louis will rewrite his own 100m record. Or Danisha will overcome overwhelming odds and step into an Olympic boxing ring. Or Amita will become Singapore’s first fencer to win a medal at the Olympics.\n\nOr maybe, five or six years from now, we’ll see two Singapore-Indian footballers line up alongside Europe’s elite on the football pitch.\n\nSprinter Shanti Pereira, and (top right) footballing brothers Kyen and Tylan Sasikumar.\n\nPHOTOS: THE STRAITS TIMES, COURTESY OF R.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFamous American writer and lecturer Dale Carnegie (1888 – 1955) wrote: “A person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”\n\nThis astute observation appeared in his 1936 bestseller How to Win Friends And Influence People.\n\nSo, getting names right is absolutely critical. However, addressing people correctly in Singapore can sometimes be tricky for foreigners.\n\nWith Chinese names, confusion sets in because the Chinese custom is to put the family name first, which is the opposite of the standard practice in European and many other cultures. In the name Tan Chee Wah, Tan is the family or surname and Chee Wah is the given name.\n\nTo further complicate matters, surnames are completely missing among Malays and Indians who adopt patronymic naming customs.\n\nFor Malay men, the patronym consists of the title “bin” (from the Arabic word meaning “son of”) followed by his father’s given name.\n\nIf Ahmad bin Ismail has a son called Osman, the child would be named Osman bin Ahmad. For a daughter, the patronym is “binti”, such as in Aisyah binti Ahmad.\n\nThese days, it is common for many Malays to drop the patronymic, so Ahmad’s children may be known as Osman Ahmad or Aisyah Ahmad.\n\nSo. always use the first name and never the second.\n\nAnother feature in Malay names, which is now common, is the existence of another personal name. This often entails the use of popular Muslim names, like Muhammad for men and Nur or Siti for women.\n\nSo the end-result could be Muhammad Osman bin Ahmad or Nur Aisyah binti Ahmad.\n\nAnother popular double name for men is Abdul. Abdul means “servant of” in Arabic and must be followed by one of the names of Allah in the Quran; for example, Abdul Haqq means “Servant of the Truth”.\n\nDo note that Muhammad could be written as Muhd, or Mohd, and Abdul as Abd.\n\nThen, traditionally, a Chinese, Malay and Indian married woman does not change her name.\n\nTo play it safe, if you meet a Doreen Tan Su Lin, refer to her as Ms Tan or better still Ms Doreen.\n\nIf he is Abdul Haqq bin Sulaiman, then address him as Mr Abdul Haqq or Mr Haqq.\n\nAnd if he’s Subramanian Balachandran, you are fine calling him Mr Subramanian.\n\nPerhaps later on, you can shorten it to Mr Subra. Do see how it pans out first.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f35d381eacf92add179c7514f6c6050c5d17dc662ef630da2173422b1f9a1e8b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

While he lives on in our hearts, I would sometimes wish his name could have lived on in other ways as well,” said the former early childhood educator.\n\n“When we got these two cockatiels, I wanted their names to be etched not just in our hearts but in something tangible. Naming our business after them is a testament to our love and belief that they will bring us luck,” said Ms Sophia, whose fondness for birds runs in the family. Her father, she explained, is a “bird whisperer” who can make any bird warm up to him.\n\nMs Sophia has not been short of support in her business endeavours.\n\nHer husband Guru Jaya, 33, and sister Sally Rubeni, 30, assist her in making deliveries, leaving her with enough time to bake and market her creations.\n\nThe cockatiels play their part too, she said. “Poi Poi is always whistling, singing and dancing as I bake, making the whole experience more enjoyable.”\n\nMs Sophia introduces new cookie flavours on special occasions. For Christmas, she focused on four flavours – chocolate chip, Moo (chocolate-vanilla), midnight cookies (for dark chocolate lovers) and Reese cookies (for peanut butter lovers).\n\nShe has already introduced a Moo In Red flavour for Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day next month.\n\nShe often hands out “mood stickers” along with the cookies, for customers to soak in the festive spirit. “I am a very DIY person, so I wanted to design my own stickers and brand logo.”\n\nFrom time to time, she also harnesses the power of generative AI to create images of her parrots for her marketing collateral.\n\nFor the new year, she plans to write a children’s book on the theme of her parrots and cookies.\n\nPublishing a book, Ms Sophia said, would be a childhood dream come true.\n\n“When I was studying business and digital marketing at Lithan Academy, I pitched the idea of publishing a book to my mentor, but I did not have strong content for it.,” she said. “So, I turned to blogging instead.”\n\nShe believes that children would relate to her parrots in the book, especially with its attractive AI-generated images.\n\nMs Sophia feels that through her cookie business, she has come into her own.\n\n“After starting my cookie business, I’m doing the things I like to do,” she said.\n\nHer sister said she always had faith that Sophia would be a successful baker.\n\n“I believe we can show the world how a parrot’s love can have a positive impact on someone’s life journey,” Ms Sally added.\n\n“Naming our business after them is a testament to our love and belief that they will bring us luck.”\n\nBaking enthusiast Sophia Rathi on her cockatiels", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/57fb519937630c868ca67278cf855e1ae2ae546b041bf74988a8b342731f60b8?w=825", "alt_text": "Sophia Rathi and her husband Guru Jaya with Noi Noi."}]}

But they are actually perched on a single head.\n\nUntitled and standing at 4.8m, it is composed of vinyl-coated polyester, an inflatable material, Usually, such pieces are made with bronze or black basalt.\n\nThe piece is the creation of India-based contemporary artist Shilpa Gupta, who received an invitation to participate in the sixth iteration of the Ng Teng Fong Roof Garden commission series, which features works by top international artists.\n\nEvery year, a renowned artist is invited by the gallery to present site-specific pieces that pay homage to the rich cultural legacy of South-east Asia.\n\nSpeaking about the work, the 47-year-old artist said: “The dualities that we all encounter on a daily basis within ourselves or from the viewpoint of societal battles and geopolitical conflicts can be applied to the two bodies.\n\n“The entwined bodies show a tapestry of meanings that inspire contemplation on the mental and physical scars that we all bear.”\n\nMs Gupta came to Singapore twice to conceptualise and install the piece. The work was made in Ohio, in the United States, then packed and flown to Singapore. It requires daily inflating.\n\nThe artist, whose works have been exhibited in various countries, said she “broke with convention” by using an inflatable medium, which “created new opportunities”.\n\n“Art in public spaces gives us a great chance to have conversations. Fewer and fewer people are coming to private galleries, so we need to be on the streets to speak with them,” she said.\n\nThe artwork will be on display until March 31 at the Ng Teng Fong Roof Garden Gallery, Level 5, City Hall Wing at National Gallery Singapore.

Santosh Kumar\n\nNoted Indian author Sutapa Basu is always looking for women in Indian history who have challenged traditions and breached male bastions.\n\nHer first historical fictional novel Padmavati: The Queen Tells Her Own Story, published in 2017, tells the story of the famous Rajput princess, saluting her fortitude.\n\nLast October, the 66-year-old came out with Parvatibai: The Forgotten Witness Of The Battle Of Panipat.\n\nIt gives a fresh perspective on the tumultuous events surrounding the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 between the Afghans and Marathas through the eyes of Baisaheb Parvatibai, the wife of Maratha general Sadashivrao Bhau.\n\n“For me, they are the heroic women of India,” Ms Basu said during a visit to Singapore this week. “Parvatibai was a witness and a survivor of the Third Battle of Panipat, which is significant because, had the Muratha army won, the British would never have been able to get a foothold and enslave India for the next two centuries.\n\n“There are many chronicles and analyses about why the Marathas were defeated. But nobody ever asked her opinion. There was probably a reason why her voice was suppressed. There were betrayals on the Martha side, and maybe they did not want her to divulge the details.\n\n“I found this intriguing and learnt that she was one of those who strategised much of that battle. She tried to make the Marathas win. They were defeated, not because of her, but because of the betrayals by the other leaders.”\n\nMs Basu, whose professional life of 47 years includes working as an editor and publisher with Oxford University Press (India) and Encyclopedia Britannica (South Asia), said she researched for about five months.\n\n“When I’m writing a historical narrative, I continuously research because if I want to draw my reader into that historical ambience, I need to know what kind of food they ate, what kind of language they spoke, what kind of clothes they wore and what kind of weapons were used,” she said.\n\n“I have explained the battle in all its totality. It was an eight-hour battle that the Marathas were actually winning. What turned the tide in the Afghans’ favour is also in the book.”\n\nTo Ms Basu, who lives in Delhi and has written 10 books including Dangle, The Legend Of Genghis Khan and The Curse Of Nader Shah, “history is very important and should be told the right way”.\n\n“History is not dead, it lives all around us,” she said. “If we want to understand today, we need to go into the past. My mission is to make people, especially the young, more interested in history. I want them to learn about their roots and feel proud.\n\n“I want to bring out the stories of the unsung heroes, especially of heroic women about whom nothing much has been written about.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5bb877410acab1ce8ccecde7f52be477982a342244cf789317acc836a8403da0?w=825", "alt_text": "Author Sutapa Basu"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTalented young batsmen Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sarfaraz Khan were hailed on Monday as the future of Indian cricket after they led their team to a monumental Test victory over England.\n\nThe left-handed Jaiswal hit an unbeaten 214 and put on a 172-run partnership with debutant Sarfaraz to set up India’s 434-run win in Rajkot on Sunday. India lead the five-match series 2-1.\n\nThere had been fears for India’s inexperienced batting line-up with former captain Virat Kohli out of the series to oversee the birth of his second child and K.L. Rahul injured.\n\nAlready missing wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant, who is still not ready to return after being hurt in a car crash in December 2022, it meant four of India’s top five had just 33 Test caps among them.\n\nBut the new batsmen more than rose to the challenge, with the 22-year-old Jaiswal scoring a double century in Rajkot for the second match in a row and Sarfaraz, aged 26, making 62 and 68 not out on his first Test outing.\n\n“Double hundred. Double fifty. This duo of Yashasvi & Sarfaraz has been double trouble for England,” cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar wrote on X.\n\nJaiswal, once a homeless boy in Mumbai who sold street food to pursue his sporting passion, scored 171 on his debut in the West Indies last year and has never looked back.\n\nHe is averaging 71.75 in seven Tests, leads the series batting chart with 545 runs, and needs 139 in his next innings to become the fourth-quickest batsman in history to 1,000 Test runs, and the fastest in 75 years.\n\nSarfaraz, 26, was presented with his Test cap by spin great Anil Kumble, with his teary-eyed wife and father looking on. He handled the England spinners with panache and was unlucky to be run out in the first innings.\n\n“We need to see him in a few more Test matches,” former chief selector M.S.K. Prasad told Kolkata’s The Telegraph. “Jaiswal definitely has the ingredients to be the next superstar. He’s proving to be an all-format player.”\n\n“The opportunities came knocking at their door just ahead of the transition period for Indian cricket, and it was good to see these players grabbing the chance with both hands.”\n\nIndia have introduced a string of new players in the series, including Rajat Patidar, 30, who made his debut in the second Test.\n\nDhruv Jurel, the 23-year-old wicketkeeper who won his first Test cap in Rajkot, was dubbed “an instant hit on debut” by the Indian Express.\n\nAFP", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e4afdcaa2d12a9aa8a17ed158302751bf4bc5fbaf0df94bc984c767fcf19b5e2?w=825", "alt_text": "Yashasvi Jaiswal celebrating after scoring a double century during the fourth day of the third Test with England at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot on Feb 18."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAfter three people died in attacks by elephants in Kerala over the last three weeks, the local authorities hope hundreds of new cameras and intense patrolling will help combat the problem, which has sparked protests.\n\nIn the most recent incident, 52-year-old tourist guide Paul Vellachalil, an employee of the Kuruva Dweep eco-tourism centre of the forest department, was fatally attacked by a herd of elephants on Feb 16 in the town of Pulpally in the forested Wayanad region, local media reported.\n\nHis family members said he could have been saved had he received timely medical attention, another issue confronting the hilly district. He succumbed to his injuries at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital, after travelling 100km on the busy hill road.\n\nThousands of people blocked roads in the town on Feb 17 and vandalised a vehicle belonging to the forest department to protest against the incident, with police resorting to baton charging to disperse the crowd, reports said.\n\nEnvironmental activists, however, blame deforestation as the root cause of the problem, saying elephants are being driven off their natural habitat into more built-up areas.\n\nAt a meeting convened by state Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, it was decided that 250 “advanced cameras” will be installed along forest borders and wildlife corridors to monitor the movement of animals.\n\nNearly 55 per cent of Kerala, a state of 35 million people, is covered by forest, according to a report from the Forest Survey of India.\n\n“The chief minister has also ordered round-the-clock patrolling of forests,” Mr Vijayan’s office said in a statement.\n\nAt least 67 people died in wild elephant attacks in Kerala between 2020 and 2022, India’s Deputy Forest Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said in Parliament last December.\n\nEnvironmental activist N. Badusha said “massive degradation of forests” in the region is affecting the elephant population. “Habitats of wild animals have shrunk, forcing them to enter human settlements for food and water,” he added.\n\nKerala’s forest minister said last year that Wayanad’s elephant population had dropped to just 1,920 from 3,322 in 2017, local media reported.\n\nIn Kerala as a whole, the number of elephants more than halved between 2017 and 2023 to just 2,386, according to a census conducted by the state’s forest department, reports said.\n\nIn other measures announced by the chief minister on Feb 17, “neighbourhood-level WhatsApp groups” and public address systems will be used in Kerala to warn people about the movement of wild animals and alert them to any danger.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d78ead299aa3f31f198f89d00b0b797454745b0a903ad310b4575852b71570be?w=825", "alt_text": "People blocking a forest department vehicle during a protest in Pulpally on Feb 17."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFormer child prodigy Lydian Nadhaswaram will make his debut as a film score composer for the Malayalam film Barroz, superstar Mohanlal’s maiden directorial venture.\n\nThe 18-year-old on Feb 1 said in a video post on X that he had recorded the “first symphonic work for Barroz in Macedonia”.\n\nThe fantasy film will open in theatres next month.\n\nLydian wrote on X recently: “With love and respect to all music composers and great musicians worldwide, my first orchestral recording for my debut movie #barroz directed by Shri @mohanlal sir!”\n\nThe teenager made headlines in 2019 when he won the US$1 million prize on American reality show The World’s Best, after he performed Beethoven and Chopin’s pieces on two pianos simultaneously.\n\nBut, even before he was crowned champion, Lydian was already an Internet sensation as he vowed netizens with his virtuosity over the piano in various YouTube videos, playing at amazing speeds and sometimes even blindfolded.\n\nLydian is also proficient on the drums, tabla, mridangam, guitar, melodica (a handheld free-reed instrument) and the harmonica.\n\nIt appears that he was destined for great things as a musician because he was named after the nadhaswaram, a wind instrument well-known in South India.\n\n“The word Lydian is Greek,” he told tabla! during an interview over Zoom.\n\n“It is a raga, one among the seven musical modes. My father used to say that it’s called the kalyani raga in Tamil. And as the majority of Indians know, the nadhaswaram is a wind instrument. I’ve always been pleased that my name has a relationship to music.”\n\nHis natural talent for music became apparent when he was just two. Lydian used two xylophone sticks and his hands to create a rhythm on the ground as the family was celebrating the birthday of his older sister Amrithavarshini.\n\nHis father, Tamil music director Varshan Satish, gave him a drum set the following day, and Lydian has been unstoppable since.\n\n“My father told me that I should always strive to be the ‘world’s best’ at anything I undertook,” said Lydian. “He said: ‘Even if you clean a bathroom, you should be the best at it’.”\n\nAfter the second grade, Lydian stopped his studies to pursue music full-time.\n\nAt age 10, Lydian completed the grade 8 piano course at the Trinity College of Music in London, the youngest in his class to do so.\n\nHe also holds the distinction of being famous Tamil music composer Ilayaraaja’s first and only pupil. “His recording studio felt like a temple,” Lydian remarked.\n\nThese days, Lydian has channeled his focus on the Thirukkural – a classic Tamil language text consisting of 1,330 short couplets, or kurals, of seven words each. The text is divided into three books with aphoristic teachings on virtue, wealth and love.\n\nHe believes that it contains all the moral lessons required for the well-being of humans, and that it should be taught to the next generation in an easy-to-understand manner.\n\n“To live a decent life in this world without pursuing further education, I have read the Thirukkural in its entirety,” he said.\n\n“My sister and I are attempting to use music to spread awareness (of the Thirukkural) worldwide. We are taking this opportunity to showcase the beauty of the Tamil language.”\n\nThe teen then explained that he and his sister are turning the Thirukkural’s 1,330 kurals into songs which will be sung by 1,000 artistes from around the globe. Each song will last less than a minute, and the work will be released in June this year.\n\nIn the meantime, Lydian will also continue composing music for films. His big ambition is to start an Indian band that “produces excellent, globally accessible, healthy music”.\n\n“My father told me I should strive to be the ‘world’s best’ at anything I undertook. He said: ‘Even if you clean a bathroom, you should be the best at it’.”\n\nMusician Lydian Nadhaswaram (left) with music director Ilaiyaraaja", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d3038846de69efdcf23090afd3426d3982b539cea0e51603f288ff636a6eb505?w=825", "alt_text": "Lydian Nadhaswaram with famous Tamil music composer Ilayaraaja."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA dental procedure to enhance his smile days ahead of his wedding allegedly led to the death of a 28-year-old man in Hyderabad.\n\nMr Laxmi Narayan Vinjan (right) died at a hospital in Jubilee Hills on Feb 16 after he was brought in unconscious following a cosmetic dental procedure at a private clinic in the city, NDTV reported.\n\nIt added that the man had got engaged a week earlier and was getting married next month.\n\nThe Jubilee Hills police registered a report under “culpable homicide not amounting to murder” based on a complaint from his father Vinjan Ramulu, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\nThe 63-year-old accused the hospital, FMS International Dental Centre, of fatal negligence. According to Mr Ramulu’s report, his son was administered anaesthesia during the “smile designing” dental procedure and fell unconscious.\n\nMr Ramulu also said his son had no known health complications. “The doctors are responsible for his death,” the father said.\n\nNDTV said Mr Laxmi Narayan left for the clinic at about 2pm, and the father learnt about the mishap at about 9pm upon calling his son on the phone.\n\nThe clinic staff informed him that Mr Laxmi Narayan was taken to Apollo Hospital and the doctors declared him dead after examination.\n\nThe father alleged in the report that it was due to the negligence of the dentist and excessive dosage of anaesthesia that his son died.\n\nStation House Officer of Jubilee Hills police station K. Venkateshwar Reddy said an investigation is in progress. The police are in the process of examining medical records and CCTV footage from the clinic.\n\nFMS International has denied medical negligence on its part.\n\nDr B.V. Rama Krishna Reddy, chief maxillofacial surgeon at FMS International, told indianexpress.com that protocols were followed during the “bridge removal and crown lengthening” procedure and captured on CCTV cameras.\n\nCosmetic dentistry focuses on enhancing smile aesthetics. Typical treatments include teeth whitening and dental bonding.\n\nAccording to Dr Reddy, Mr Laxmi Narayan and his mother first visited the clinic on Jan 30 regarding changing his existing dental bridge on the lower front teeth.\n\nOn Feb 16, he reached the clinic an hour before the appointment and wanted to get the procedure done the same day.\n\nCosting about Rs60,000 ($970), it is a commonly performed procedure with a very simple dosage of anaesthesia. According to Dr Reddy, in all its 14 clinics across Hyderabad, FMS International performs around a hundred such procedures in a month.\n\nIn Mr Laxmi Narayan’s case, all was well during the three hours of bridge removal and crown lengthening until he felt post-operative pain while waiting to fix temporary teeth, said Dr Reddy.\n\n“Usually, such pain is common, and we give painkillers about 40 minutes after the procedure,” Dr Reddy told The Indian Express. “In his case, since he said he felt pain, we gave him a painkiller mixed with water immediately. After the first gulp, he wanted to puke.

It was during my time as a teacher that I discovered my passion for working with young children and nurturing their curiosity through art and language.”\n\nTeaming up with her partner Naveen David, Nusha embarked on the ambitious task of turning her passion project into a thriving business.\n\nWhile her creative talents flowed effortlessly into the writing and illustrating process, she acknowledges the challenges of navigating the business side of things.\n\n“Managing the business aspects can be daunting,” she said. “But I’m grateful for Naveen’s support and expertise. Together, we’ve learnt and grown, laying the foundation for Nush Nooks to flourish.”\n\nAs the creative force behind Nush Nooks, Nusha is driven by a desire to inspire and instil moral values in children through her storytelling.\n\nCentral to this mission is the innovative Vocab-Pro feature, designed to expand young readers’ vocabulary and comprehension skills.\n\n“Exposure to a rich vocabulary while growing up enriched my own imagination,” Nusha explained. “I wanted to offer the same experience to children, providing definitions for advanced words within the pages of our books.”\n\nNusha envisions Nush Nooks as more than just a publishing house. She wants it to be a platform for creativity, learning and community.\n\n“Children are naturally curious,” she said, “and I believe in nurturing that curiosity through engaging and informative storytelling.”\n\n“Beyond the books, our Instagram page (@nush.nook) serves as a hub for interaction and engagement.\n\n“In the long run, we aim to expand our offerings to include art and writing workshops, providing children and parents with opportunities to explore their creative potential together.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b89f425f4b4fadd85a339c0a07be418175f7f14387b12a5aa7ff15c9f5a67743?w=825", "alt_text": "Nusha Dakshyni, co-founder and author of Nush Nooks."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBulging muscles struggling to break from the grasps of the skin.\n\nIt was enough to peel the eyes of tourists and Singaporeans alike away from the Singapore River façade to marvel at the 1.93m tall, 140kg human wonder in front of them – the 2009 Mr India, Varinder Singh Ghuman.\n\nThe 40-year-old was in Singapore for the first time from Jan 31 to Feb 6 for a social media shoot.\n\n“Singapore is a beautiful and culturally rich country, and people love to see beautiful locations on social media, so we came here,” said Ghuman.\n\nHe explored several tourist spots, including Sentosa, Orchard Road, Arab Street and Marina Bay Sands, posing for photos with astounded members of the public along the way.\n\nGhuman is a rare breed among bodybuilders as he is a lacto-vegetarian, who has not even touched an egg in his life for religious reasons.\n\nAs a youth growing up in Gurdaspur, Punjab, Ghuman got his protein from buffalo’s milk that was available on his father’s farm. These days he takes supplements for that purpose.\n\nMedia outlets like The Times of India have reported that Ghuman is the world’s first vegetarian bodybuilder and that he was the first Indian bodybuilder to secure a pro card from the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) when he won gold at the Australian Grand Prix in 2011.\n\nHe captained the Indian amateur bodybuilding team at the World Championships and the Asian Bodybuilding Championships in 2010 and 2011. He has won four national gold medals, and finished second in the Mr Asia contest in 2009.\n\nGhuman said his good genes were evident from his college days when he started getting results faster than others from the strength training he did as a discus and shot put thrower.\n\nHowever, he had to work harder to make a mark on the world stage.\n\nThe turning point came in 2004, when he went to a bodybuilding event, where then Mr India Manjit Singh was the chief guest.\n\nSeeing Manjit flex his muscles, Ghuman decided to become a bodybuilder, and duly hit the gym.\n\nGhuman’s resolve to become a champion was further strengthened when he shared the stage with American high-profile bodybuilder, actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Arnold Classics in the United States in 2010.\n\nHis ripped muscles drew the attention of Schwarzenegger, who appointed him as brand ambassador for his health supplements and gyms in Asia. Shortly after, Schwarzenegger described Ghuman as “an amazing talent” in a Facebook post.\n\nGhuman’s bodybuilding efforts also paved the way for an acting career. After starring in a music video for a Punjabi song in the late 2000s, he got to play the lead in the 2012 Punjabi film Kabaddi Once Again.\n\nHe also acted in the 2014 film Roar: Tigers Of The Sundarbans and the 2019 Hindi venture Marjaavaan.\n\nHis action sequences caught the eye of Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, who helped him get cast for Tiger 3 last year.\n\n“Salman Khan set a bodybuilding era in Bollywood,” said Ghuman. “I am his big fan.”\n\nThis year, Ghuman looks forward to the release of He Man, a superhero film in which he plays the lead role. In November, he plans to compete in the Romanian Muscle Fest Pro in Bucharest.\n\nHis lifetime dream, though, is to qualify for Mr Olympia, the ultimate professional men’s bodybuilding contest.\n\n“Some coaches have suggested that I eat non-vegetarian food, but my inner soul will never allow me to eat meat,” said Ghuman. “If you have good knowledge, you can get as much protein from a vegetarian diet.\n\n“I don’t want to be a vegan too. We are Punjabi – we love milk-based products like cottage cheese and curd. It will be difficult to go without those foods.”\n\nBodybuilder and actor Varinder Singh Ghuman striking a pose against the backdrop of the Merlion and Esplanade.\n\nPHOTO: Tamil Pasanga Photography\n\nBodybuilder and actor Varinder Singh Ghuman striking a pose against the backdrop of the Merlion and Esplanade.\n\nPHOTO: Tamil Pasanga Photography\n\n“Some coaches have suggested that I eat non-vegetarian food, but my inner soul will never allow me to eat meat.”\n\nBodybuilder and actor Varinder Singh Ghuman", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/27db5ddcfdb2cdb05f105e7e2d1a229e6671fa6bd3d2c9db4e417e9eaa5172e8?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The AH-64D will do the 180 deg wingover, Lasso, Alpine and Viking.\n\nThe aerial display will culminate with the Golden Salute to mark the RSAF’s appreciation to all Singaporeans. The AH-64D will perform a “bow” and the F-15SG a vertical spiral climb, releasing flares.\n\nThe chairman of the RSAF Flying Display Committee, Lieutenant Colonel Ng Han Lin, said: “The aircraft fly at vastly different speeds and a lot of behind-the-scene coordination is required.

It will highlight the prodigious skills of the IAF pilots, as well as the agility and manoeuvrability of the Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH Dhruv) manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).\n\nFour ALH Dhruvs took to the skies on Feb 20 in a close formation aerobatics display performing manoeuvres including the Dolphin’s Leap, Cross Over Break, Double Arrow Cross, Mesh, Level Cross, Sarang Heart and Sarang Split.\n\nThe Sarang Heart was one of the manoeuvres that stole the viewers’ hearts as the smoke trails made a heart shape.\n\nThe helicopters flew in the Sarang formations of the Inverted Wineglass, India and Diamond.\n\nThe Sarang team, led by Group Captain S.K. Mishra, did similar manoeuvres at the Dubai Airshow last year and has performed in Chile, Germany, the United Kingdom and Russia.\n\nThe team also performs regularly all over India.\n\nThe Sarang team’s first international display was in Singapore at the Asian Aerospace Airshow in 2004.\n\nThe 2022 Singapore Airshow also saw a performance by India’s indigenously manufactured Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas.\n\nWing Commander Ashish Moghe, a former Sarang pilot and the team’s spokesperson, said: “Singapore and India enjoy deep defence ties and cooperation.

I’m adamant it should be spelt and pronounced “biryani”.\n\nThe name changes as it travels, my friend Selvam argues. “In India, it’s mostly known as biryani, but in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, it is biriyani – because of how the word is read in Tamil.”\n\nAs valid as his observations are, I nonetheless reject them as irrelevant.\n\n“If one has to be true to the origin of the dish, then it is biryani, as it comes from Persia. Or, if we consider that its origin is from the Indian languages, primarily Urdu, again biryani is the accurate spelling,” I replied defiantly, fleetingly recollecting a linguistics course in semantics I took 20 years ago in college for extra credit.\n\nIn 2004, Indian archaeologists discovered some 170 varieties of biryani recorded by the Maharaja of Patiala, and biryani experts gauge there could be 20 to 30 varieties of biryani that traverse the Indian subcontinent.\n\nBiryani comes from the word “birian”, which means “fried before cooking” in Persian. The Mughals credit themselves for introducing the dish to India, where the two more well-known versions of the dish are the Lucknow, or Awadhi, and Hyderabadi.\n\nBoth use similar cooking styles – meat, fish or vegetables cooked with spices, combined with rice and finished in a pot. This style is called dum briyani in Singapore, largely to separate it from the local version where the rice and meat are cooked separately.\n\nThe Middle East countries have their own versions, of course – Nasi Mandi anyone? – while in Bangladesh, puffed rice is used in their biryanis. And in Sri Lanka, where it is called buryani, I’m told there is a version made with idiyappam. Slightly sacrilegious, but fine.\n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, the local version is largely made by Indian-Muslim restaurants. And it is at one such eatery that tabla! is kick-starting its Biryani Is Life column, which will regularly give you the lowdown on various low-key biryani joints across Singapore, regardless of style, spice level or rice colour.\n\nAt Imam Banana Leaf, though the establishment serves primarily south Indian dishes with white rice, the biryani is its biggest draw – most notably, the lamb shank biryani ($17).\n\nA sizeable lamb shank slathered with gravy is placed alongside fragrant basmati rice studded with broken down cashews and accompanied by raita and a crumpled piece of popadum. I swapped the regular-sized hard-boiled egg accompaniment for quail eggs.\n\nIt’s vital to note that this is not your traditional “dum” style where the meat is cooked with the rice, allowing the grains to absorb the juices and fat from the meat.\n\nThe light-brown coloured rice has no pretence of added saffron or the like. It does, however, have a good amount of heat, much thanks to the south Indian spices.\n\nThis ain’t Hyderabadi; it is unapologetically Singaporean. And though not as revered as the authentic “dum” version, Imam’s rendition passes the test.\n\nThe meat is so tender that it falls right off the bone without even a mere prod of the fork and, crucially, before I had time to snap a meaningful photo.\n\nThe shank is pricey, but you get what you paid for. Just make sure you use your hands to get every morsel of meat off the bone. A fork and spoon gets you only so far before your shirt gets masala-splattered.\n\nImam’s chicken biryani also has a unique quality, with its lightly fried thigh pieces coated in thick red gravy. While resembling something out of a tandoor, it tastes akin to a Malay-style ayam masak merah (chicken in spicy tomato sauce).\n\nSome traditionalists might not take too well to Imam’s flight from authenticity here, but there’s also merit in being different from the rest.\n\nBy the time we’re scooping up the last grains of rice from our banana leaves, Selvam and I are finally in agreement. It doesn’t matter how you spell or pronounce biryani. If a dozen variations mean there are a dozen different versions of the timeless dish, then biryani is better for it.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c0e3182f7c780e9255b2f5cc8445a517d0edaed85b29ace08f4d825ead8674b0?w=825", "alt_text": "Lamb shank biryani at Imam Banana Leaf Restaurant."}]}

It is the Office of Police Accountability that bears the responsibility of disciplinary investigation and proceedings relating to Officer Auderer’s comment, not the Prosecuting Attorney’s Office,” news agency PTI quoted from the statement.\n\nAccording to local media reports, speed was the cause of the collision. Officer Dave did not have his siren activated continuously.\n\nInstead, he “chirped” his siren at the intersection and did have his emergency lights on.\n\nMs Kandula was a graduate student at Northeastern University’s Seattle campus.

I hate vada pav from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nShe explained the reason: “There’s no way you think boiled potato and bread makes sense.”\n\nThe host of the show mentioned that potatoes are first boiled and then fried and served on a pav. Eventually, a chutney is added.

He facilitated a workshop at SAVH where students were trained to make scented candles which Ameya then promoted and sold during the festive season.\n\n“As I undertook this journey, I realised I needed to broaden my product range and customer reach,” said Ameya, now 15, and a student at United World College.\n\n“I started engaging with Singapore-based outlets and was lucky to collaborate with Scoop Wholefoods to exhibit and sell products crafted by visually impaired individuals at their flagship store at Great World City.”\n\nThe pop-up exhibit runs until this Sunday, and features 23 different types of products ranging from various types of bags and placemats to scented candles and cushion covers.\n\nThe venture has raised some $5,000, said Ameya, who has pledged 100 per cent of the proceeds to various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in India, namely the Blind Relief Association, the National Association for the Blind and the Disha Foundation.\n\n“The reception has been encouraging and will contribute to my target of achieving $10,000 by this calendar year.

She didn’t notice my actions initially, but slowly began to warm up to me.”\n\nMrs Viji finally reciprocated Mr Ramesh’s affections when she was 20 and working as a customer service officer at a training company. Mr Ramesh, then 23, was a mechanical engineer at maritime transportation company Sembawang Bethlehem.\n\n“I began to see him as more than just the neighbourhood boy,” said Mrs Viji, now 54 and a baker. “I saw his qualities and admired his caring nature, and realised he loved me deeply.”\n\nAfter a few years of courting, the couple got hitched in 1994.\n\n“She was the angel of my life and I decided that, if I am to marry, it would be only to her,” said Mr Ramesh.\n\nOn the topic of technology playing the role of cupid these days, Mrs Viji and Mr Ramesh agreed that dating apps do have the benefit of introducing a person to more people outside their daily circle.\n\n“We were blessed that we found each other right next door, but sometimes this is not possible, and it’s okay to search online.”\n\nShe pointed out that, despite the evolving landscape of human connection in the digital age, the essence of love remains unchanged.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bc4283af085a8b67c1df76a7f8c5583c09057fcc6a20a13e2b0226c19891b917?w=825", "alt_text": "Mrs Durga Devi and her husband Vadiveilan Gunsekaran wih their three children."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRAVI SINGARAM\n\nFeb 15, 1942, marked the beginning of a dark chapter in Singapore’s history.\n\nThe resistance of the British Army ended and the Japanese embarked on a reign of terror throughout the land, once considered an “impregnable fortress”. Several died in fierce defence.\n\nSingapore is now a first world country, but even as citizens thrive in peace, the sacrifices of their forefathers cannot be ignored.\n\nIn line with that notion, the National Heritage Board (NHB) has come up with a series of exhibitions and theatrical experiences that will allow Singaporeans to relive the battles fought.\n\nTitled Battle for Singapore, the series will run from Saturday to March 3.\n\nMr Letchmenon Mariappan, 83, was two years old when Singapore fell to the Japanese. His father, who had been serving in the British Police since 1923, was among the first to be rounded up for interrogation.\n\n“My father knew they would look for him, so before that, he sent my mother and my sister to our hometown in Malacca,” recalled Mr Letchmenon. “Luckily, they let him go and, in fact, employed him in the police.”\n\nAs a result, Mr Letchmenon’s family was moved to different police barracks – from Hill Street to Beach Road to Thomson, according to their father’s postings.\n\n“We were very lucky. While many others were tortured by the Japanese and suffered from malnutrition, we were given food. The Japanese were very kind to us and many other Indians,” said Mr Letchmenon.\n\nHowever, his uncle was not as fortunate. An engineer, he was sent to work on the Burma Railway (also known as the Death Railway) and never made it back home.\n\nThe fall of Singapore is not just significant to wartime survivors like Mr Letchmenon and his 85-year-old elder sister, but is a lesson to be noted by the younger generations too.\n\nMr Goh Chour Thong, NHB’s director of International and Museum Relations, said: “Stories of human resilience, hope and perseverance through the toughest of times never grow old.\n\n“We are always excited to help Singaporeans rediscover physical vestiges of Singapore’s World War II history, which still remain amid our changing urban landscape.”\n\nA Cycling Buona Vista tour, led by heritage experts, will take participants down the Buona Vista defence line, which was key during the final battles for Singapore. It will start from Buona Vista and continue through Pasir Panjang, Gillman Barracks and other military sites before culminating at Haw Par Villa.\n\nThere will also be guided tours to Cashin House at Lim Chu Kang Nature Park, which witnessed some of the first landings of the Japanese troops, and historical sites such as Bukit Brown, Mount Pleasant and the Civilian War Memorial.\n\nA 110-minute immersive theatrical experience titled No Question Of Surrender: Three Days Before The Fall premiered yesterday at the official opening of The Battlebox – an underground command centre in Fort Canning Park.\n\nAt the National Museum, a Makan With Seniors segment will feature second-generation war stories over meals, while Peacetime Kitchen cooking demonstrations will allow participants to learn wartime recipes.\n\nThe Singapore Art Museum will also present a conversation with the artists behind Hotel Aporia, an installation that reveals different perspectives of Singapore’s wartime past.\n\nIn total, there will be more than 25 programmes and over 70 tours.

Santosh Kumar\n\nANUSHA SELVAMANI\n\nWhen customers visit the Indian Barber Shop, which has 10 outlets islandwide, they are greeted by a rather unusual sign: Free Haircut Services.\n\nThe franchise is helmed by Mr Veerappan Muthukumaran, an Indian immigrant who believes it is his duty to give back to society after overcoming difficulties in starting a business in Singapore. The free haircuts apply to wheelchair-bound elderly people.\n\n“I am doing this as a volunteer service rather than a business that gives me income,” the 46-year-old told tabla!\n\nA migrant from Chennai, where he used to work in the banking sector, Mr Muthukumaran accompanied his wife, Dr Seduraman Abirami, to Singapore in 2010 as she hoped to seek better job opportunities.\n\nWhile she found a position at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), he struggled to find a job that matched his qualifications.\n\nFor some time, all he did was take care of their children, aged 11 and 9, before finding work as a temporary business consultant.\n\nThen, in 2014, a friend told him about the owners of a barber shop near a workers’ dormitory in Jalan Kayu who were looking to sell their business.\n\nHe soon bought over the business and renamed it Indian Barber Shop.\n\n“My family members were not happy about me running a barber shop, but I was undeterred,” said Mr Muthukumaran, who employed experienced barbers from Singapore, India and Malaysia.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, he expanded his business to 24 outlets across the island. During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, he had to shut 14 of those outlets due to the rising rents.\n\nWhile running the shop at Jalan Kayu, Mr Muthukumaran received suggestions that he should provide free haircuts to elderly residents in the area who come from low-income families, some of whom are bedridden.\n\n“I then told my employees to go down to the senior residents’ homes and give them free haircuts,” he said.\n\nApart from elderly Jalan Kayu residents, seniors from AWWA nursing home and Bethany Nursing Home also began receiving free haircuts.\n\n“It became a monthly affair for my team,” said Mr Muthukumaran. “When other organisations approached us, I told my boys to go and serve those beneficiaries as well.”\n\nTo date, the Indian Barber Shop – across its 10 outlets, including in Pasir Ris and Bukit Panjang – has provided free haircuts to more than 11,000 people.\n\n“Even though rent keeps rising, I make sure my customers view my shop as affordable,” said Mr Muthukumaran, who gets about 40 customers a day. “I want them to patronise my shop. It should give them a comfortable neighbourhood vibe.”\n\nThe haircut and shaving services at the shop are priced from $5 to $25.\n\n“People ask if I find this business profitable as my rent ranges from $1,800 to $7,000, and I do not charge the elderly,” said Mr Muthukumaran. “I am still able to thrive, which shows that a big profit is not my motive. No matter what, customers always come first for me.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f1739f631603dba953dc7b0c72c637f9f69851bd742641aef0cb8697908f6962?w=825", "alt_text": "An elderly man getting a free haircut from employees of Indian Barber Shop, helmed by Mr Veerappan Muthukumaran ."}]}

After three laps around the old Farrer Park field and 15 minutes of skipping exercises, I was already drenched in perspiration.\n\nFor the first time, I realised just how heavy a boxing glove actually was. “How am I even gonna swing this at someone’s face?” I said to one of my teammates as he tied the laces of a black glove, which weighed half a kilogram, to my wrist.\n\n“That’s the point,” answered an older voice from behind me. “If you want to box, you have to build strength and endurance.”\n\nMy boxing coach, Syed Abdul Kadir, had heard it all before from clueless 16-year-olds like me. We wanted to throw punches and inflict pain. But we had no clue about the work we had to put in to earn that privilege.\n\n“You wanna float like a butterfly, learn how to skip rope first,” Kadir, a Commonwealth Games bronze-medallist, would tell us.\n\nSince 1934, St Andrew’s Secondary School has been the only school in Singapore to offer teenage boys a chance to take up boxing as an extracurricular activity. It was started by Canon Adams, the principal of the school at the time. He hoped that when faced with hardship, Saints would “learn to cope, be able to take life’s hard knocks, and learn to counter-attack”.\n\nAt the school, it has also been a long-standing tradition – since the 1970s – to hold bouts involving students as part of its National Day celebrations.\n\nThe bouts, during my school days in the 90s, were held in an ad hoc boxing ring set up in the middle of the school’s quadrangle, and officiated by professional referees.\n\nWe would train once a week at the Singapore Amateur Boxing Association headquarters in Farrer Park. Closer to Aug 9, we would train an extra day on the school grounds as well.\n\nStudent boxers then were made up mostly of the school’s rugby players – rugby being the institution’s most revered sport – but, in my one and only year with the school boxing team, I recall there was also a librarian and a chess club member.\n\nFor 16-year-olds, boxing was the epitome of cool, inspired no less by fictional icons such as Rocky and, of course, boxing legends Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson.\n\nFor me, personally, it was perhaps also innate. After all, I was told by my late father, a devout boxing fan, that I was named after his favourite boxer.\n\nLocally, boxing has suffered a decline since Kadir, a St Andrew’s old boy who picked up the sport in school, represented Singapore in the 60s and 70s.\n\n“During those days, people would run from work and school to watch the fights. People were more keen on rough and tough games. But lifestyles change,” he once said.\n\nThe boxing tradition in St Andrew’s, though, was something he was proud of continuing. He coached the Saints from 1990 to 2016.\n\n“It is one sport that really helps the boys learn self-respect and discipline.”\n\nKadir was just nine years old when he started out. By 20, in 1968, he had won his first national championship. He made his South-east Asian Peninsular Games debut in 1969, winning a bronze medal before going on to win gold in 1971 and two silvers in 1973 and 1975.\n\nHis greatest achievement was a bronze at the 1974 Commonwealth Games, but he considers the 1972 Olympics one of his proudest moments, when he fought a Cuban.\n\nThe stocky Kadir was dominating his opponent until a cut above his brow ended his hopes. Officials deemed the cut serious enough to stop the fight, and they awarded the bout to the Cuban.\n\nKadir retired in 1976 at age 28, but was national coach and secretary of the Singapore Amateur Boxing Association until 2003.\n\nIn 1999, he was named among ‘Singapore’s 50 Greatest Athletes of the Century’. On Feb 6, in a ceremony attended by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore’s only Olympic boxer was inducted into the Singapore Sport Hall of Fame.\n\nIn tribute to the athletes honoured, Mr Tharman wrote on his Instagram: “Syed Kadir was shorter than most boxers in the light-flyweight category, but was soon renowned for his superfast left hook.”\n\nThese days, Kadir, who is of Arab descent,  moves around in a wheelchair. Aside from suffering a mild stroke a few years ago, the 75-year-old also suffers from dementia.\n\nDespite his condition, he still recalls his time at St Andrew’s, both as a student and a coach.\n\n“As a student, I remember watching the seniors compete against one another. Watching them gave me motivation to train and compete, and that is how my boxing career began,” he told tabla!.\n\nWhen asked about his best memories coaching students, he said: “Apart from the students competing, we had national boxers and boxers from overseas fighting in exhibition matches to inspire the students, and many of them showed keen interest in the sport.\n\n“My son (Syed Fahmy), who was also from Saint Andrew’s, picked up the sport and began his boxing journey from there.”\n\nLike his father, Syed Fahmy, 49, won the Singapore National Championships back in 1995 at the age of 19. He went on to represent Singapore in numerous international competitions until 2000.\n\nCurrently, he and other former students of his father are running Kadir’s Boxing School in Guillemard Road.\n\n“As a coach, my dad used to emphasise that one must make huge sacrifices to become a boxer – train regularly, no late nights, be humble and have a positive mindset,” he said.\n\nBoxing at St Andrew’s, meanwhile, still continues.\n\nNo longer do students battle inside a makeshift ring in the middle of the quadrangle; these days, National Day bouts are held indoors – still under the supervision of professional coaches and referees.\n\nBack in 1996, despite my namesake-inspired calling, I was ultimately left out of the National Day fight card. Training, you see, had been too much to keep up with. Tedious drills and regular rope-skipping became too much for restless, ill-disciplined me. And because I didn’t clock enough training sessions, I couldn’t box on the big day.\n\nI doubt Kadir remembers me as a student, and it saddened me to hear of his deteriorating health. But I certainly won’t forget him as a coach, or that aptly phrased slogan on his gym wall.\n\n“Boxing is one sport that really helps the boys learn self-respect and discipline.”\n\nSyed Abdul Kadir on coaching students at his alma mater, St Andrew’s Secondary School.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cf8669e877ab4a8f3d7a283a37ffe01f7f7259c380842a749c0545ac7922d4f2?w=825", "alt_text": "Syed Abdul Kadir (seventh from left) with St Andrew’s Secondary students during the school’s National Day boxing event in 2016."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a5c26900edbdb22f124934705bce57da492db0812ed86094ce0c5f23bd9158bb?w=825", "alt_text": "Syed Abdul Kadir (seventh from left) with St Andrew’s Secondary students during the school’s National Day boxing event in 2016."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cf8669e877ab4a8f3d7a283a37ffe01f7f7259c380842a749c0545ac7922d4f2?w=825", "alt_text": "Syed Abdul Kadir (seventh from left) with St Andrew’s Secondary students during the school’s National Day boxing event in 2016."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a5c26900edbdb22f124934705bce57da492db0812ed86094ce0c5f23bd9158bb?w=825", "alt_text": "Syed Abdul Kadir (seventh from left) with St Andrew’s Secondary students during the school’s National Day boxing event in 2016."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cf8669e877ab4a8f3d7a283a37ffe01f7f7259c380842a749c0545ac7922d4f2?w=825", "alt_text": "Syed Abdul Kadir (seventh from left) with St Andrew’s Secondary students during the school’s National Day boxing event in 2016."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMs Shayara Bano heaved a sigh of relief on Feb 7 at the enactment of a law banning polygamy in her state Uttarakhand, the culmination of a years-long effort, including her own case before the nation’s Supreme Court.\n\n“I can now say that my battle against age-old Islamic rules on marriage and divorce has been won,” said Ms Bano, a Muslim woman whose husband chose to have two wives and divorced her by uttering “talaq” three times.\n\n“Islam’s allowance for men to have two or more wives at the same time had to end.”\n\nBut Ms Sadaf Jafar did not cheer the new law, which abolishes polygamy and instant divorce, even though she has been waging her own court fight against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent.\n\n“Polygamy is permissible in Islam under strict rules and regulations, but it is misused,” said Ms Jafar, who is seeking alimony to support their two children. She says she did not consult Islamic scholars as she hoped Indian courts would provide justice.\n\nThe adoption of the Uniform Civil Code in Uttarakhand has opened a chasm between women in India’s largest religious minority.\n\nSome, like activist Bano, 49, celebrate the new provisions as the overdue assertion of secular law over parallel syariah rulings on marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption and succession.\n\nFor others like Ms Jafar, Muslim politicians and Islamic scholars, it is an unwelcome stunt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nAdoption of the code in Uttarakhand is expected to pave the way for other states ruled by the BJP to follow suit, over angry opposition from some leaders of the 200 million Muslims who make India the world’s third-biggest Muslim country.\n\nBJP leaders said the new code is a major reform, rooted in India’s 1950 Constitution, that aims to modernise the country’s Muslim personal laws and guarantee complete equality for women.\n\nA 2013 survey found that 91.7 per cent of Muslim women nationwide say a Muslim man should not be allowed to have another wife while married to the first.\n\nStill, many Muslims accuse the BJP of pursuing a Hindu agenda that discriminates against them and imposes laws interfering with Islam. Syariah law permits Muslim men to have up to four wives, and it has no stringent rules to prohibit the marriage of minors.\n\nMs Jafar, who has run for office with the main opposition Congress party, calls the passage of the code a tactic of Mr Modi’s government to divert attention from pressing issues like improving the livelihood of Muslims.\n\nIn addition to the polygamy ban, the new code sets a minimum marriageable age for both genders and guarantees equal shares in ancestral property to adopted children, those born out of wedlock, and those conceived through surrogate births.\n\nMs Jafar, who lives with her two children in Uttar Pradesh, said: “Islam has enough provisions to provide a life of dignity.

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhen a father in India received a call from an unknown overseas number last month, he did not expect to be the latest to fall for an elaborate fraud scheme involving Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nThe scammer, who claimed he was a police officer, told Mr Himanshu Shekhar Singh that his 18-year-old son had been caught with a gang of rapists and needed Rs30,000 ($486) so he could clear his name, Indian media reported on Monday.\n\nMr Singh told The Indian Express of the Jan 8 incident: “The next minute, I heard a voice saying, ‘Papa please pay him, they are real policemen, please save me’.\n\n“I could not doubt for a second that he was not my boy. The style of speaking, crying – everything was the same.”\n\nWhile Mr Singh was suspicious, he feared the caller was a kidnapper, so he made an initial payment of Rs10,000.\n\nHe then decided to look for his son on his own. The teenager was later found taking a test at an education centre unharmed.\n\nThis was one of three prominent cases to rock New Delhi and its National Capital Region in recent weeks as scammers tap into AI to develop convincing fake voice recordings of children to trick their parents into transferring money.\n\nAudio deepfakes can be created with a real clip of the target’s voice.\n\nIn another case, Mr Rajesh Kumar Garg, an engineer who lives in Pitampura, received a call on Jan 9 from a person threatening to implicate his son, who is pursuing his MBA in Hyderabad, in a rape case.\n\n“They said my son was caught with a gang involved in heinous crimes… but as he seemed to be from a good family, they intended to release him – provided I pay them,” Mr Garg told The Indian Express.\n\n“I heard my son crying over the phone, it sounded exactly like his voice. First, they demanded Rs50,000. When I said I didn’t have that kind of money, they asked me to pay Rs30,000, and I did as they asked.”\n\nA friend then suggested that Mr Garg call his son.\n\n“My son said he was in college and was fine. It was a +92 code with a police officer’s photo,” said Mr Garg.\n\nIn a similar case, a journalist living in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, received a scam call where the scammers used technology to mimic her son’s voice.\n\nFortunately, her son was studying in front of her when the scammers called.\n\nThe journalist said: “It is a huge concern that cyber criminals are targeting children now. Where are they getting details of kids and their parents? This must be thoroughly investigated with utmost priority.”\n\nDelhi police officer Manish Kumar Mishra said: “Such cases are not very frequent, but recently there has been an uptick in cases of ‘cloning’. We are trying to understand how exactly cyber criminals are creating cloned voices to dupe people.”\n\nWith rapidly improving AI, voice cloning has become more convincing. “It takes as little as three seconds for your voice to be duplicated,” said chief data officer of Transaction Network Services Greg Bohl.\n\n“When you start saying, ‘Here’s my address,’ or ‘I didn’t make that appointment’, when you start getting sentences going, they have you.”\n\nHe said voice-cloning capabilities are rapidly improving, including the ability to type in real-time text strings for a cloned voice to repeat (enabling live-spoofing during calls) and simulating noisy environments.\n\n“They can bring in the sound of a subway station, an airport,” he said. “You’re at the airport; you’re the executive travelling. You’ve been in a car accident, and you’ve got that street noise going on behind you. It sounds exactly like what’s taking place.”\n\nAnother concerning twist? “The scammers have the ability to add accents and age ranges,” he said.\n\nMcAfee’s recent report called The Artificial Imposter highlighted that a majority of Indians (69 per cent) cannot distinguish between an AI voice and a real voice.\n\nNearly half of Indian adults have either experienced or know someone who has experienced some sort of AI voice scam, which is almost twice the global average of 25 per cent.\n\nSome 83 per cent of Indian victims reported a monetary loss, with 48 per cent losing more than Rs50,000.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“It takes as little as three seconds for your voice to be duplicated.

The figure was below the 1.2 per cent official estimate made in January.\n\nGrowth in the final quarter of 2023 came in at 2.2 per cent year on year, down from the 2.8 per cent initially estimated. It missed analysts’ average forecast of 2.5 per cent growth, as polled by Bloomberg.\n\nMTI said Singapore’s external demand outlook for 2024 has remained largely unchanged since its last review in November.\n\n“Growth in the advanced economies is expected to moderate in the first half of the year, mainly due to continued tight financial conditions, before recovering gradually in line with an expected easing of monetary policy as inflationary pressures recede,” said Dr Beh Swan Gin, MTI’s permanent secretary of development, at a media briefing following the release of the Economic Survey of Singapore 2023.\n\nRegional economies are expected to see a pickup in growth in the year ahead, supported in part by the turnaround in global electronics demand, he added.\n\nHowever, the global economy still faces serious downside risks. These include the Israel-Hamas conflict, the lagged effects of monetary tightening stressing regional economies with external funding needs and idiosyncratic cost shocks which could weaken the economic recovery momentum.\n\nMTI expects Singapore’s manufacturing and trade-related sectors to see a gradual pickup in growth in tandem with the turnaround in global electronics demand. The electronics and precision engineering industries in particular are projected to rebound, given the stronger-than-expected recovery in semiconductor sales.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/singapore-keeps-2024-growth-forecast-at-1-3?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBollywood actor Ranveer Singh dropped one of the biggest surprises of the year on Monday when he featured in an ad with adult star Johnny Sins to promote his sexual wellness brand.\n\nIt was done in a very Indian, cheesy way – a parody of the melodramatic “saas-bahu” (mother-in-law and daughter-in-law) relationship commonly seen in television serials.\n\nSins plays a man who faces sexual health issues, and as one character says: “His Johnny can’t sin!”\n\nThe ad starts with Ranveer asking his younger brother Johnny’s wife why she’s leaving their house. After that, much drama takes place among the family members.\n\nLater, with the help of a capsule (that enhances men’s sexual health), Johnny’s wife decides to stay.\n\nThe entire cast, including Ranveer and Sins, are dressed in traditional Indian wear.\n\nNeedless to say, the ad drew a lot of attention, with several netizens pointing out that they had never imagined such an ad would be made.

Not only does it use Ranveer Singh (and Johnny Sins - Google him!) in a totally unexpected (and hilarious) way using the much-derided Indian TV series trope, but it also makes the product category far more accessible to a wider set of people beyond it being used in hushed tones!”\n\nStand-up comedian Tanmay Bhatt said on Ranveer’s Instagram handle: “So good to see one of my all-time favourite sexual icons….and also Johnny Sins.”\n\nThe commercial also left many people wondering who was paid more, Ranveer or Sins.\n\nRanveer, who in December announced that he is a co-founder of sexual health and wellness brand Bold Care, said: “I’m here with sincere intent to use my influence for raising awareness and making a positive impact.\n\n“The Bold Care campaign is more than talk; it’s a mission I am deeply connected to, and I am here to bring a change in how we address men’s sexual health, aiming for tangible solutions and millions of lives impacted all across the country.”\n\nBold Care claims it provides products that offer solutions for intimate health issues, including premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/563ef5c4e0d3f6ce56dc9056500fe49170e0ab2594bfa3e28bd0cb91c69ae9f8?w=825", "alt_text": "Johnny Sins and Ranveer Singh (right) in the ad."}]}

There are flashbacks to Monkey Man’s past and his vigorous training to become the vigilante, as well as Patel fighting numerous assailants.\n\nPatel, 33, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 2017 for Lion, plays the lead, is the director and has written the film.\n\nPaul Angunawela and John Collee helped him pen the screenplay.\n\nThis is not the first time Patel has starred in a movie that challenges social politics in India, as he first gained major recognition for his part in Slumdog Millionaire, a tale of how a street kid from the slums came to win a game show.\n\nMonkey Man has the added advantage of having Peele, the Oscar-winning filmmaker best known for his horror movies with deep social commentary including Get Out, Us and Nope, as the producer.\n\nThe film features an international cast including Sharlto Copley, Sobhita Dhulipala, Pitobash, Vipin Sharma, Ashwini Kalsekar, Adithi Kalkunte and Sikandar Kher.\n\nSobhita, who makes her Hollywood debut with Monkey Man, called the film a “roller coaster”.

The move was to promote racial harmony during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPHOTO: ANDY LIM\n\nAli Kasim\n\nALI KASIM\n\nAs soon as Mr Andy Lim sits down for our interview, he inquires if I speak Tamil.\n\nI tell him the few basic phrases that I know, and he repeats them – only, with much better pronunciation.\n\n“Ours is like broken English and Tamil, substituting the vocabulary here and there,” he says.\n\nBy “our” he means himself and the people he works with in India. “Tamilish”, he further explains, is the Tamil-English patois he uses to communicate with people in Chennai, where the 42-year-old has been working for the past 17 years.\n\n“I needed to learn the language as soon as I got there,” Mr Lim says. “Most of the engineers speak English, but the drivers and others, speaking to them in English is not going to work.”\n\nHe goes on to list the cities and states in India he has worked in or visited, from Mumbai to Mizoram, dropping a footnote for the places he found fascinating, and it soon becomes clear Mr Lim is no ordinary Singaporean Chinese.\n\nWhen he graduated with a diploma in electronics, computer and communication engineering from Singapore Polytechnic in 2006, Mr Lim, then 25, made the rather unusual decision to begin his career in India.\n\nHis company at the time, Pro-Pack Materials, which manufactured clean room and electrostatic products, needed a Singaporean to oversee first-hand its sales portfolio in the Indian market.\n\nYoung and yearning for experience, Mr Lim knew India would offer opportunities that he would not have here.\n\n“With my educational background, I would have been at the bottom of the organisational ladder somewhere. In India, I got a chance to prove myself,” he explains.\n\nNaturally, the change in time zone, climate and culture required some acclimatising to in the beginning.\n\n“When I went (to India), I didn’t really know what to expect, so I simply had no expectations.,” he said. “The biggest problem I had initially was with diarrhoea. I had it almost every day, and couldn’t figure out why – was it the water, the food or the air.\n\n“It took three to four months for me to get used to it. And when I came back to Singapore, I had diarrhoea again, because my stomach had to switch back.\n\n“A lot of people think food in India is dirty, but that’s not true. It’s just that we have different bacteria in our body. A lot of Indians when they come here, they get diarrhoea on the first day too.”\n\nAfter spending one year in a comfortable serviced apartment in Bengaluru, Mr Lim realised he needed to step out of his comfort zone if he wanted to maximise his output. So he moved to very basic living quarters next to the company’s office in Ambattur – an industrial zone an hour’s drive from the heart of Chennai.\n\nThere, he had to get water from a hand pump, travel 50km by rickshaw to meet customers at times, and put up with a litany of privations, especially in regard to obtaining registrations for work.\n\nHis first “welcome to India” moment, though, came when he boarded a train.\n\n“I was carrying a lot of equipment with me, and had to use the toilet in the train. I remember getting shocked when I saw that the toilet bowl was just a hole, there was no flush or anything,” he said.\n\n“And then you have people clinging onto the side of the train and on top of it – I had never seen such a thing before, so it was quite a culture shock.”\n\nThe first step towards assimilation, he thought, was to learn the local lingo, and he duly picked up conversational Tamil and a smattering of Hindi.\n\n“Language always helps to break the ice. People always appreciate the effort I made to learn their language and eat their food,” Mr Lim says.\n\nMr Manjokumar Sivam, 33, who has been working with Mr Lim since 2016, said he was impressed with Mr Lim’s ability to converse in Tamil right from the moment they met.\n\n“It really helps because as our boss we can always go directly to him when we have an issue,” said Mr Manojkumar, who is based in India.\n\nHe rates Mr Lim’s proficiency in Tamil as eight out of 10.\n\n“I speak with him in Tamil all the time. The others too,” said Mr Manojkumar. “But it’s not just the language, he also understands our culture, how we live and work, and that’s something (foreigners) don’t always do.”\n\nThe lack of food options was a concern for Mr Lim in the beginning. Outside the traditional banana leaf fare – “I love it but I can’t eat it every day,” Mr Lim rationalises – restaurant variety was slim pickings in Ambattur.\n\n“In Ambattur, there was this roadside fried rice, from a very dirty and dusty stall,” he said. “But they charged 25 rupees ($0.40) for chicken fried rice, and so in the beginning I would eat it very often. I loved it; you can’t find it anywhere else. Then in 2009, KFC opened in Chennai, so that became my go-to eatery.”\n\nIn the end, his decision turned out to be a wise one. In his first four years, he expanded Pro-Pack Materials’ client base from a handful to more than 100. Today, as director of Statfree, a company he formed in 2022 dealing in the same services as Pro-Pack, he oversees several offices and manages a workforce of more than 70 people.\n\n“With my educational background, I would have been at the bottom of the organisational ladder somewhere.

This is something that we have been talking about, but nothing has happened.”\n\nKhushbu is also impressed by the way people respect the laws in Singapore. “Locals, as well as visitors, take India for granted,” she said. “They litter everywhere. They spit wherever they want. They don’t follow the traffic lights.\n\n“But, whenever they go overseas, they follow all the rules.

Santosh Kumar\n\nEngland came prepared for the usual trial by spin that greets touring cricket sides in India, but a “magical” seam-bowling masterclass by Jasprit Bumrah in Visakhapatnam saw their hopes of victory in the second Test vanish into thin air.\n\nTo deal with the expected conditions, England picked spin-heavy attacks complemented by a lone fast bowler both in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. The frequency with which their batters – who are known to play aggressively (bazball) – played the sweep shots also indicated their resolve to conquer the spin challenge.\n\nAnd, after their spinners accounted for 18 of India’s 20 wickets en route to winning the first Test, the tourists would have been anticipating another spin-fest in Visakhapatnam.\n\nWhat they probably did not expect is that Bumrah would emerge as their main threat despite having hardly any assistance from the pitches in the series.\n\nArmed with an unorthodox sling-shot action and a reversing ball, Bumrah went wide off the crease to create angles and operated with pinpoint accuracy to torment the batters.\n\nHis 9-91 on a spin-friendly track saw him named Player of the Match, despite Yashasvi Jaiswal’s maiden double hundred.\n\nBumrah’s domination of England’s top batters particularly stood out in India’s series-levelling victory.\n\nJoe Root has become Bumrah’s “bunny”, the England batter falling to the Indian for the eighth time in Test cricket and prompting former England captain Alastair Cook to say he feared it had become a “mental game”.\n\nBut Bumrah saved his best for England vice-captain Ollie Pope, whose match-winning 196 in Hyderabad is considered the best knock by a visiting batter in India.\n\nThe jaw-dropping yorker which splattered Pope’s stumps in Visakhapatnam will be talked about for a long time.\n\nThe seamer also castled Ben Stokes with another delivery that prompted the England captain to drop his bat and shake his head in disbelief.\n\n“Sometimes you can be critical of your own team. But sometimes you also have to just doff your cap to the opposition and say they were touched by genius,” former England captain Nasser Hussain told Sky Sports.\n\n“That spell from Bumrah in England’s first innings was genius,” he said, referring to Bumrah’s 6-45.\n\n“I think, really, it was just the magic of Jasprit Bumrah that was the difference.”\n\nTalking about his staggering statistics in India, Bumrah told commentator Harsha Bhogle that he doesn’t care much about the numbers.\n\n“As I said before, I don’t look at numbers,” the fast bowler said. “As a youngster, I did that, and it made me excited. But now it’s an added baggage.”\n\nWhen Harsha informed Bumrah that the entire cricketing world, including Pakistani fast bowling legend Waqar Younis was talking about his yorker to Pope, Bumrah replied: “As a youngster, that is the first delivery I learnt (yorker). Had seen the legends of the game. Waqar, Wasim (Akram) and even (India’s) Zaheer Khan.”\n\nWhen asked about the competition with England pace bowler James Anderson, who is a legend of the game, Bumrah said he doesn’t get into competition.\n\n“Before a cricketer, I’m a fast bowling fan. If somebody’s doing well, kudos to them. I look at the situation, at the wicket and think what are my options. I should not be a one-trick pony.”\n\nFormer captain Sourav Ganguly said India did not need turning tracks to win Tests at home when they have pacers of the calibre of Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, who missed the first two Tests with an ankle injury.\n\nEngland, who are off to Abu Dhabi for a short break, are likely to wonder what Bumrah has up his sleeve for the third Test in Rajkot, which begins on Feb 15.\n\nReuters\n\n“Sometimes you have to just doff your cap to the opposition and say they were touched by genius.”\n\nFormer England captain Nasser Hussain on India’s Jasprit Bumrah’s bowling", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/87f257ca3b6540508a9a208d57ee119ab2fed6eb3228934782ca4b2625284489?w=825", "alt_text": "England’s Ollie Pope is yorked by Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah in the second Test."}]}

Authorities have ruled out foul play or a possibility of a hate crime in the case.\n\nOn Jan 15, the bodies of two Indian-origin students at Sacred Hearts University were discovered in their Hartford, Connecticut, residence, authorities said.\n\nDinesh Gattu, 22, and Sai Rakoti, 21, both suffered accidental overdoses involving fentanyl, according to the Connecticut chief medical examiner.\n\nThe most horrific death was that of Vivek Saini. A resident of Haryana, he died after he was brutally beaten in Georgia’s Lithonia on Jan 16.\n\nThe 25-year-old was pursuing an MBA and worked part-time at a convenience store that sheltered a homeless man, Julian Faulkner. Saini had reportedly given the man chips, water and even a jacket. On Jan 16, the student refused to give Faulkner free food, which led to the attack.\n\nThe 53-year-old assailant has been arrested.\n\n“It doesn’t take a lot for these gruesome things to happen,” said Mr Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American studies at Amherst College in Massachusetts. “People will be like, ‘Oh, my gosh, this could have happened to my child, this could have happened to me. Is this really the place I want to go to for my higher education?’”\n\nFour days after Saini’s death, the body of Indian-American freshman Akul Dhawan, 18, was found in sub-zero temperatures on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus.\n\nHe was reported missing by a friend after leaving their dorm at around 1.30am, and though campus police said they did an extensive search, his body was found 10 hours later by a passer-by, just 200 metres away from where he was last seen.\n\nThe autopsy suggested that he died from hypothermia, reported The Mint. However, his parents have filed a police report, accusing the university’s police department of negligence and inaction after Akul was reported missing.\n\n“This is bizarre, that a kid was not found though he was less than a block away, sitting there, frozen to death,” his father Ish Dhawan reportedly said.\n\nStatistics reveal that as many as 403 Indian students studying abroad have died since 2018. Of these 36, were reported in the US, The reasons include natural causes, accidents and medical conditions.\n\nWhile studying in the US opens a window of new opportunities, safety is a growing concern. Prof Dhingra said that, while the campus might be a safe and happy place for minority students, a surrounding small town might not be.\n\n“If you’re in rural Connecticut, or rural Indiana, that creates its own kind of concern,” he said. “‘Where do I feel safe?’”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“It felt like a pattern, like, why was it another Indian kid? It just felt traumatic.”\n\nVirag Shah, 21, a junior at Purdue University in Indiana, where two of the seven deaths occurred", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c32fbf12688a620487d7ad29d8d598c3ec62f529f1fe176faee4ca0472c23d9e?w=825", "alt_text": "Akul Dhawan, Sameer Kamath, Shreyas Reddy Benigeri and Neel Acharya.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAfter impressing everyone in Jailer, Rajinikanth returns to the silver screen in his daughter Aishwarya’s Tamil sports drama Lal Salaam, which releases today.\n\nThe filmmakers released an intriguing trailer on Monday, which gave a glimpse of how actor Vishnu Vishal, who plays the protagonist and a Muslim, redeems himself from a troubled past after a Hindu priest predicts that he will bring a good name to his village through cricket.\n\nRajinikanth, 73, appears in an extended cameo as Moideen Bhai, a father who aims to promote communal harmony. The trailer also showed a glimpse of legendary cricketer Kapil Dev.\n\nThe film demonstrates how politics plays a role in the life of two individuals and their families in a rural Tamil Nadu town after they decide to focus on their sports careers.\n\nNetizens shared their excitement after watching the trailer.\n\nOne said: “Ranjini sir and Vishnu Vishal, superb combo. Waiting for the film.”\n\nAnother wrote: “Expecting a message-oriented movie instead of a commercial one, but Thalaivar entry with A.R. Rahman is pure goosebumps moment.”\n\nRahman, who has composed the music for the film, revealed that he initially felt the film would be “boring”, reported The Indian Express.\n\nHe said: “When Aishwarya told me the film’s story, I thought it would be preachy. But once I saw the film, my views changed.\n\n“The scenes I thought would be cringy were handled completely differently. I asked her who wrote the dialogues for the film, and she said – I wrote and appa (father) changed them a bit.\n\n“I realised it was Rajinikanth’s wisdom. He respects everything and researched well for the film.”\n\nRahman, however, received criticism for using artificial intelligence (AI) to recreate the voices of late singers Bamba Bakya and Shahul Hameed’s for the song Thimiri Yezhuda. Some fans dubbed the move as “disrespectful” and “morally unethical”.\n\nBut Rahman told the BBC that the deceased singers’ families had agreed to it, stating, “We pay them (their families). In a way, I felt my conscience is clear. They were surprised. I think there’s a legit way to do that; any technology should benefit humanity, you know, not take away livelihoods.”\n\nLal Salaam marks Aishwarya’s comeback to feature film direction after an eight-year hiatus since Vai Raja Vai.\n\nThe film’s launch took place at a private college in Chennai on Jan 26, when Aishwarya revealed that it was initially difficult to undertake the project as there weren’t many producers who wanted to bankroll it.\n\nShe also said she did not consider asking her father to be a part of the project at first.\n\n“When my father read the script, he asked me if he could do Moideen Bhai’s role,” she said. “I never thought about him for the role until he suggested it.”\n\nThe film’s other actors include Vikranth, Senthil, Jeevitha, Thambi Ramaiah, Ananthika Sanilkumar, Vivek Prasanna and Thangadurai.\n\nLal Salaam will be released in theatres in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam and Kannada.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“When my father read the script, he asked me if he could do Moideen Bhai’s role.

But suddenly we all are talking about cervical cancer, aren’t we? I am proud of what my death news has been able to achieve.”\n\nHowever, the stunt didn’t land well with several people, including celebrities Pooja Bhatt, Sara Ali Khan, Aly Goni and Rahul Vaidya, who furiously slammed Pandey for faking her death and demeaning an important cause, reported Al-Jazeera.\n\nBhatt, who had offered condolences on Pandey’s “death”, said on X: “I never delete tweets but did so in this case where I expressed my shock at the news of Poonam Pandey’s demise. Turns out the news was engineered by a digital/PR team. Absolute disgrace & disservice to those battling the same – her included.”\n\nTV actor Goni wrote: “Cheap publicity stunt; it was nothing else... u guys think it’s funny? U and ur PR team should be boycotted... shame on u all.”\n\nThe hashtag “PoonamPandey” attracted more than 60,000 posts on X with the majority being critical of the actress.\n\n“Worst publicity stunt ever,” said one user. “This was the most ridiculous way to promote something,” posted another.\n\nOne person called Pandey “the biggest fraud”.\n\nThe All Indian Cine Workers Association demanded police action against Pandey.\n\n“Strict action against them is necessary so that such types of fake news will not be circulated by anyone,” it said.\n\nThe association also commented that using cervical cancer for self-promotion is unacceptable, while adding that no one in the film industry stoops this low for publicity.\n\nMaharashtra legislator Satyajeet Tambe also demanded that Mumbai police take action against Pandey for putting out fake news.\n\nDigital agency Schbang later admitted to orchestrating the “fake death” and apologised for its actions.\n\n“Our actions were driven by a singular mission – to elevate awareness about Cervical Cancer. In 2022, India registered 123,907 cervical cancer cases and 77,348 deaths, it said.\n\n“After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second-most frequent malignancy affecting middle-aged women in India.”\n\nPandey began her modelling career in 2010 and garnered a reputation for outlandish stunts and her risque behaviour.\n\nShe pledged to strip for the Indian cricket team if they won the 2011 cricket World Cup at home, later posting a video online of her shedding her clothes at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai where the tournament’s final was held.\n\nBorn in Uttar Pradesh, Pandey has acted in a handful of Bollywood films, including the 2013 erotic thriller Nasha, in which she played a teacher who has a sexual relationship with two high school students.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1a8d2bfd750abe2bf89133f79691607d9bec2f09bdc9d1c0df0b27efb7757bd0?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTwice a month, for up to four hours, Ms P. Santhia takes care of terminally ill children.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been volunteering with HCA Hospice, Singapore’s largest home hospice care provider which was set up in 1989, for the last three years.\n\nShe provides parents and other caregivers respite, allowing them to look after the other children in the family, run errands or simply take a breather.\n\n“I love children a lot. They really make my day, and so I find this volunteer opportunity rewarding,” said Ms Santhia, who works full-time at her family’s childcare business.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 circuit breaker in 2020, Ms Santhia could not meet her friends and relatives. That set her thinking about how lonely seniors in nursing homes would feel every day. She then began looking for volunteer opportunities.\n\n“I studied various volunteer programmes and settled on Medi Minders, HCA Hospice’s respite care service,” she said. “It helps children and young adults who have life-threatening or life-limiting conditions.”\n\nMs Santhia was attached to a mentor for a few months before taking on assignments on her own. The children she cares for are mostly bedridden.\n\nWhen she visits a house, she talks to the parents first and assures them that their child is in safe hands.\n\n“Some children will not be able to respond to my gestures,” she said. “They will just stare at me when I am reading books or playing music for them.\n\n“They melt my heart. I always try to control my emotions when I’m with them.”\n\nOften, Ms Santhia also has to tube-feed the children under her care.\n\n“The kids are attached to their feeding tubes and are non-communicative. It’s a sight that saddens me,” she said. “Imagine having to go through pain when other children are freely moving around.”\n\nUntil recently, she was a caregiver to a bedridden boy with spinal cord problems for over a year.\n\n“We spent a lot of time together watching his favourite anime shows. I miss him so much,” she said.\n\nMs Santhia also volunteers at other organisations and charities, such as SPD (Serving People With Disabilities) as a befriender – people who provide support and companionship to lonely or emotionally distressed individuals.\n\nDuring the circuit breaker in 2020, Ms Santhia was one of the first tele-befrienders that SPD engaged and trained.\n\nWith home visits suspended at the time, she made regular phone calls to check on her assigned senior, Mdm Angie, 74.\n\nAccording to SPD, it was challenging initially for Ms Santhia to engage the senior (over the phone) as they had yet to form a bond, making interaction difficult.\n\n“With her perseverance and the support from SPD’s social work and volunteer management team, Ms Santhia managed to get the senior to open up to her gradually,” said the charity.\n\n“As time passed, the pair developed a beautiful friendship where they could even talk on the phone for hours now.”\n\nBut looking after children as a Medi Minder is her first love.\n\n“Taking care of terminally ill children really takes a toll on the parents amid their busy schedules; they deserve some rest and respite,” she said.\n\n“They express their gratitude by giving me food, well-wishing cards and health books. It’s these small gestures that move and motivate me.”\n\n“They melt my heart. I always try to control my emotions when I’m with them.”\n\nMs P.

Iswaran must also provide his itinerary and his address overseas to the investigation officer (IO) and remain contactable by the IO.\n\nHe must also surrender his travel documents within 24 hours of his return to Singapore.\n\nIswaran’s case will also be transferred to the High Court, with the prosecution citing strong public interest in the case.\n\nDefence lawyer Navin Shanmugaraj Thevar requested an early trial for his client so the “evidence can be fully aired and the matter decided as soon as possible”.\n\nAll 27 charges Iswaran faces were re-read to him on Thursday, as required when a case is transferred to the High Court.\n\nIswaran is accused of 24 counts of obtaining, as a minister, items with a total value of more than $200,000 from property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Mr Ong is the man who brought Formula One to Singapore in 2008.\n\nThese items include tickets to the Singapore Grand Prix, football matches in Britain and musicals.\n\nSeveral of the charges were related to alleged incidents that happened between 2015 and 2021, and involved him allegedly obtaining tickets to a football match between West Ham United and Everton and to shows such as Harry Potter And The Cursed Child.\n\nHe also faces a charge of obstructing the course of justice on or about May 25, 2023.\n\nAccording to court documents, he had allegedly made repayment of $5,700 – the cost of his business class flight ticket from Doha to Singapore that he had taken on Dec 11, 2022, at Mr Ong’s expense – through Singapore GP.\n\nIswaran was arrested in July 2023 by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) following its investigation into a separate matter.

But, in the last eight months, the road has turned into a dirty drain, making it difficult for residents to commute.\n\nPeople from more than 30 colonies use this road. But, due to the filthy conditions, they have to take a detour of 2km.\n\nA few days earlier, posters saying ‘No development, no vote’ were pasted outside a dozen colonies in the area, but to no avail, reported India Today.\n\nThe residents complained that public representatives have not taken any action despite multiple demands.\n\nIn frustration, Mr Sharma decided to stage the unique protest alongside his wife.\n\nThe anniversary celebration was attended by fellow residents accompanied by a musical band.\n\nMr Sharma said the couple’s initial plan was to celebrate their wedding anniversary in Lakshadweep or the Maldives. However, the bad sewer and waste disposal facilities in their area made them change their minds.\n\nOn Sunday, the couple garlanded each other as priests chanted mantras and then the guests had a “feast” standing on the muddy road.\n\n“Since the last 15 years, we have been making continued efforts,” said Mr Sharma. “We have gone to all the public representatives and concerned authorities. Since there was no action, we were forced to protest in such a manner.”\n\nMs Devi said the protest was to highlight the issue on a larger scale.\n\n“The Yogi (Adityanath) government is doing a good job.

You know when you watch Tamil movies and the plot is about a guy or girl who runs away because their marriage has been arranged, and they can’t marry the person they love – I’ve seen that happen in reality a few times.\n\n“When it comes to wealth, they don’t have the subsidies we have here in buying a flat, for example.\n\n“People don’t realise that when Indians from the rural areas go to the city to find work, many of them actually return to their villages because it isn’t easy for them. So the way they think about income is different from us – in terms of priority.”\n\nFor budding entrepreneurs here looking to pave a career path in India, Mr Lim’s main advice is to “stay on your toes” to the ever-changing rules and regulations.\n\n“From visa regulations to tax customs, the government rulings keep changing every one to two years. You can’t control it, so you just have to prepare for change,” he said.\n\n“From a tourist perspective, I guess that’s why people love India – you don’t really know what to expect. You could read TripAdvisor and all that, but in the end, it may not be relevant. Every place in India is so different from another. That’s the best thing about it.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/188a12f948b8292018d024f544cc383007e7b3f1f2aa6935e41110c4bc2bacb4?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nCapitaLand India Trust (Clint) is buying three industrial facilities in OneHub Chennai in India on a forward purchase basis from Casa Grande Group, its trustee-manager said on Monday.\n\nThe total transaction cost of Rs2.7 billion ($43.7 million) includes the partial funding for the lease of the project land, as well as full funding for the project’s development.\n\nHighlighting OneHub Chennai as an “established industrial township with plug-and-play infrastructure”, Mr Sanjeev Dasgupta, chief executive of the trustee-manager, said the acquisition would also enable Clint to offer its tenants “high-quality facilities” at the project.\n\n“With our forward purchase agreements, we have a pipeline of industrial assets at strategic locations, allowing us to capitalise on the growing demand from global companies looking to set up industrial facilities in India.”\n\nFrom this month, Clint will provide funding for the project of up to Rs1.9 billion across three phases.\n\nIt will acquire the facilities upon completion of the construction of each phase, which is subject to a six-month stabilisation period for leasing.\n\nEach phase of the project will be developed by separate special purpose vehicles established by Casa Grande.\n\nThese special purpose vehicles will be acquired by Clint at purchase prices that also account for pre-agreed capitalisation rates, rentals and leasing levels.\n\nSpanning 7.95ha of leasehold land with a renewable lease tenure of 99 years in total, the project is slated for completion in three phases over four years.\n\nOver the land’s total net leasable area of 790,000 sq ft, phase one of the project covers 480,000 sq ft, while phase two is made up of 160,000 sq ft. Another 150,000 sq ft of land comprises phase three of the project.\n\nClint’s trustee-manager said the development of phase one will commence this month, with completion slated for the first half of 2025.\n\nThe trustee-manager expects the forward purchase of these facilities to increase Clint’s floor area of industrial, logistics and data centre asset classes to 14 per cent of the trust’s committed pipeline, from 12 per cent currently.\n\nIn the trustee-manager’s view, its forward purchase of the three facilities in OneHub Chennai is priced attractively, considering current market capitalisation rates.\n\nIt expects the acquisition to improve Clint’s earnings and distributions for unit holders, while offering the trust further diversification into the industrial asset class.\n\nAssuming that the transaction was 45 per cent funded by debt and 55 per cent using equity, and also factoring in income generated from the project on a stabilised basis, Clint’s trustee-manager estimates a financial year 2023 pro forma attributable net profit of $2.1 million from the acquisition.\n\nThis would have lifted Clint’s financial year 2023 pro forma distribution per unit to 6.48 cents from 6.45 cents, with no effect on net asset value per unit, which would remain at 1.16 cents.\n\nThe Business Times\n\n“We have a pipeline of assets at strategic locations, allowing us to capitalise on the growing demand from companies looking to set up industrial facilities in India.”\n\nMr Sanjeev Dasgupta, chief executive of the trustee-manager", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2f550e80c8eed59a1bae9c755f17bfd5e832ae2528f0189028081cbb83244f41?w=825", "alt_text": "CapitaLand India Trust’s acquisition of three industrial facilities in OneHub Chennai (above) is expected to diversify the trust’s portfolio and grow its industrial presence in India."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nKHUSH RANDHAWA\n\nListen to an Indian businessman negotiating with a Korean counterpart, and you will likely hear a strange strain of English.\n\nJust simple words and stock phrases with weird grammar and syntax.\n\nThey are speaking Globish.\n\nPronounced Globe-ish, it is the brainchild of Frenchman Jean-Paul Nerriere.\n\nWhen he was an IBM executive in France, he was astonished that despite his heavily accented and lower standard of English, he could communicate more effectively with international clients than his American boss.\n\nThis was probably because his boss, like most native English speakers, would talk too quickly and use unfamiliar words and expressions, which hindered communication.\n\nSo Mr Nerriere came up with Globish, which only has 1,500 commonly-used English words for non-native speakers to transact business.\n\nWords such as “nephew” and “niece” become “the son and daughter of my brother”. A big word like “collaboration” is replaced with “working together”.\n\nGlobish speakers also avoid all figurative expressions. So, there is no need to understand Anglophone literature and culture to grasp the meaning of what was said.\n\nThe result: Globish is much easier to learn compared to the King’s English and its 615,000 words.\n\nIn fact, the globish.com website promises: “Starting from scratch, anyone in the world should be able to learn Globish in about one week.”\n\nIt also recommends listening to popular English songs to aid pronunciation, and gesticulating when unable to find the right words.\n\nMr Nerriere maintains that Globish is not a language. He explains: “A language is the vehicle of a culture. Globish doesn’t want to be that. It is a means of communication.”\n\nMany scholars predict that people won’t be bothered to learn English if they can get by with Globish.\n\nNow, there is the rise of written Globish, thanks to the widespread use of e-mail and WhatsApp.\n\nWith spellcheck and translation software, anyone can communicate in written Globish.\n\nWhile some still consider Globish to be gibberish, an estimated 1.5 billion people are already using it as a second language.\n\nMy fear is that if it does become the worldwide dialect of the third millennium, I may have to devote a full week to learn it.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/37f6e35b8fd2fb26ece2dfaf8233bd699ec53ad67358c5c4b395558367b69c92?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The van driver, a 23-year-old man, was arrested for careless driving causing death, said the police.\n\n“That day, I was the teacher in charge of the class, and I had no inkling it would be my last encounter with her,” said Ms Geetha Santosh, 50, the school’s academic director. “Her last words of ‘bye Ms Geetha’ still echo in my head.\n\nMs Geetha said Shambhavi left the school around 3.45pm that day.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nSingapore’s mandatory death penalty for convicted drug traffickers has many critics, including Amnesty International, human rights organisation Reprieve, and British billionaire Richard Branson.\n\nThey believe the harsh policy adversely punishes low-level traffickers and couriers who are typically recruited from marginalised groups – and it has done little to stop major drug traffickers and organised syndicates.\n\nBut the law has a supporter in Dr Kiran Bedi, the first woman to become an Indian Police Service Officer and who is famous for initiating reforms at the tough Tihar Jail during her tenure as Delhi’s Inspector-General of Prisons from 1993 to 1995.\n\n“Traffickers ruin millions of lives, and the drugs they distribute affect not just one person, but families and society,” the 74-year-old told tabla! on Tuesday, during a four-day visit to Singapore when she attended a business conclave. “So, I think, they deserve it.\n\n“Of course, the executions have to be decided case by case. But you should remember that the drug trafficker spares nobody. He’s inducing millions of people to become addicted. And it takes a heavy toll on families.\n\n“I did my PhD in drug abuse and domestic violence. And I’ve seen women and children become the prime victims of drug traffickers.”\n\nDr Bedi said governments have to take strong steps to end this menace.\n\n“Having run a prison and being a police officer, I know that you have to look at every crime per se and not generically,” she said.\n\n“I believe the sufferings of the victims too have to be evaluated. There are many accused who are reformable. But certain crimes require no sympathy or mercy.”\n\nDr Bedi highlighted that executions must be carried out only after a proper psychology study has been done of the convict. “If he is unrepentant, incorrigible and cannot be changed, then I think execution is the right way.\n\n“While you are looking at the rights of the accused, you should also remember the rights and feelings of the victims. You have to balance the two. I believe all such executions are evidence-based and have gone through the process of law.”\n\nLaw and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam has often said that critics of Singapore’s mandatory death penalty for convicted drug traffickers miss the point that it saves lives and protects Singaporeans.\n\nHe told the BBC’s HARDtalk programme on June 29, 2022, that capital punishment is imposed here because there is clear evidence that it is a serious deterrent for would-be drug traffickers.\n\n“The trafficker wants to make money. He, you know, is damaging the lives of drug users, their families – damaged, often seriously destroyed,” he said.\n\nA 2021 report by the World Health Organisation showed there were 500,000 deaths linked to drug abuse in just one year.\n\nIn the United States, there are more than 100,000 deaths due to drug overdose in a year, and life expectancy declined in 2015, for the first time since World War I, due in large part to the opioid crisis.\n\n“Every culture, every country has the right to decide what is the best message to be given to drug traffickers,” said Dr Bedi. “It has to be a powerful message. Every punishment has prevention, deterrence and reform. So, you have to make a choice between the three.”\n\nMr Shanmugam has said in the 1990s, Singapore was arresting about 6,000 people a year for drugs, but this has now dropped to about 3,000 people a year.\n\nCompared with 30 years ago, there are more drugs in the region, and Singapore would be completely swamped without tough penalties, he added.\n\nSingapore’s deterrent penalties have “saved thousands of lives”, he said.\n\nIn India, “the drugs situation is under control”, Dr Bedi said. “But then again, traffickers will find ways to challenge the rules. That is where punishment is very important.\n\n“In India, if you are caught with drugs beyond a certain quantity, it is 10 years straight in prison and non-bailable. If you repeat the offence, the death penalty is an option. But executions are rarest of the rare.”\n\nHangings in India in recent years have mostly been carried out for murder, rape and terrorism.\n\nFor Dr Bedi, executions actually reduce the suffering of the accused. “Lifelong imprisonment is worse,” she said. “It means that the accused suffers over a long time and dies in prison eventually.\n\n“I believe Singapore is going about it the right way.”\n\n“Of course, the executions have to be decided case by case. But you should remember that the drug trafficker spares nobody.”\n\nDr Kiran Bedi", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/79d0a3f9c94ac3b3a5896472c52b7839f56d341e34cd29782d35a9bebed81847?w=825", "alt_text": "Dr Kiran Bedi addressing members of the Indian Women’s Association in Singapore."}]}

I have been told, and also myself noticed, how women in chess are often just taken for granted by spectators,” said the player from Nagpur, who won the Asian women’s chess championship last year.\n\n“Most recent example of this on a personal level would be in this tournament. I played a few games which I felt were quite good, and I was proud of them.\n\n“But I got told by people how the audience was not even bothered with the game, and instead focused on every (other) thing in the world: my clothes, hair, accent and every other irrelevant thing,” she wrote in her post.\n\nAt the Tata Steel Masters chess tournament, Divya finished 12th in the challengers section with a score of 4.5.\n\nThe teenager said while male players were getting their share of the spotlight purely for their game, the women were judged for aspects which had nothing to do with their ability on the chess board.\n\n“I think it is the sad truth that when women play chess, people often overlook how good they actually are, the games they play and their strength,” she said.\n\n“If I go to any guy’s interview, there would be way less judgement on a personal level and actual compliments about the game and the player.”\n\nThe Tata Steel Chess organisers issued a statement in support of Divya on Tuesday, alluding to the sexist comments she’s faced. “As a leading tournament, we remain committed to promoting women in chess and ensuring a safe and equal sporting environment,” it read.\n\nDivya clarified that the “audience” she was referring to in her Instagram post weren’t the spectators at the Wijk Aan Zee tournament.\n\n“The tipping point for me was the YouTube comments,” Divya told Hindustan Times. “If you look at it from a distance it can seem like nothing. But it’s been years of this. It has been happening repeatedly to me for the past five years. I don’t like to pay attention to such things, but sometimes it’s just too much and crosses all limits of tolerance.”\n\nWhile many of the disparaging YouTube comments appear to have been taken down by the Wijk Aan Zee organisers, they ranged from remarks over her height, physical build, dental braces, and accent to those that were sexually suggestive.\n\nGrandmaster and former women’s world champion Susan Polgar responded to Divya’s post saying she “consciously chose to look ugly, plain and unattractive” as a young player herself to avoid drawing male attention.\n\nIt’s a thought that crossed Divya’s mind several times too. “But then I thought why should I change how I dress because of some disgusting comments or not-so-nice people? I don’t think I should give them that power or control over me.”\n\nWomen remain a minority in chess, comprising roughly 11 per cent of overall classical-rated players and just 2 per cent of Grandmasters.\n\n“So many guys have thrown tantrums when they’ve lost to me, just because I’m a girl,” Divya said. “I feel boys tend to underestimate girls and can’t stand losing or even drawing against them. Of course, not all boys, but a majority of those I’ve seen.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7ced1414823cd61ca45b660d55b71a310e27eb3fcea1774da8689c3fba6f0794?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Yet, it seems a tad more special in Penang’s Georgetown.\n\nOn the eve of the Hindu festival, which was held on Jan 25 in Malaysia like in Singapore, hundreds of booths serving free food and drinks, including heaps of coconuts, line the sides of the road.\n\nOn the day itself, cries of “huat ah” (prosperity) rend the air as coconuts are smashed to the ground while gold and silver chariots bearing the statue of Lord Murugan approach the Arulmigu Sri Bala Thandayuthapani Waterfall Hilltop Temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga.\n\nThe chariots had begun their journey the night before from the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in Queen Street and the Kovil Veedu (Temple House) in Penang Street, some 18km and 8km away, respectively, from their destination.\n\n“I love taking part in Thaipusam each year. I find that my good luck increases,” said lorry driver Bryan Chua.\n\nRetired power station employee Raghunathan Rengasamy, 74, who has observed Thaipusam processions in Penang for 15 years, believes it is a spectacle like no other in the city.\n\n“Locals proudly proclaim that Penang Thaipusam is the best. I agree,” he said. “The atmosphere is celebratory, carefree and yet also safe.”\n\nAfter two years of restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some 1.5 million people from all over Malaysia attended the three-day Thaipusam celebration in Penang last year. The population of Penang is approximately 1.75 million.\n\nAt this year’s one-day event, attendance was not as stellar, but you could hardly tell given the thousands that carried kavadis and milkpots up to the hilltop temple.\n\nDevotees have to climb 511 steps to reach the temple, almost twice the number required to reach the Batu Caves in Selangor.\n\nAirport officer Kanchana, 48, who made a milk-pot offering, said the journey to the temple each year gives her immense peace and satisfaction.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nFormer Liverpool left-back John Arne Riise wants to be part of Indian football’s growth story, despite the national team failing to make a mark at the ongoing Asian Cup in Qatar.\n\nIndia lost to Australia 2-0, Uzbekistan 3-0 and Syria 1-0 and failed to progress beyond the group stages. Yet, the Norwegian, who had two stints in the Indian Super League (ISL) following his time in England, believes he has a role to play in lifting the fortunes of the national side.\n\n“They have a lot of potential, and I want to go back and help out wherever possible,” said Riise, who played for the Delhi Dynamos in 2015 and Chennaiyin FC in 2016.\n\n“Since my playing time there, Indian football has grown,” added the 43-year-old, who was in Singapore on Monday to launch the April 20-21 StarHub Football Festival.\n\n“The fan base is huge and people are beginning to accept that football too can be a big draw and a money-spinner just like cricket.”\n\nRiise does not know what exactly went wrong with India at the Asian Cup, especially after the team achieved some impressive results last year, including wins over Kuwait and Lebanon.\n\n“I follow Indian football closely,” he said. “There are a good bunch of youngsters coming up, but they have to be 100 per cent professional.\n\nIf you don’t live, think and behave like a professional, you cannot perform at the highest level. They have to be like European footballers, who only train, eat, sleep and prepare well for matches. They certainly need top European coaches who can show them the way.\n\n“It’s disappointing that India did not qualify for the second round at the Asian Cup. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to do.”\n\nRiise, who made more than 250 appearances for Liverpool from 2001 to 2008, said he enjoyed playing alongside Indian players “who are big fans of football and want to improve all the time”.\n\n“I saw some real talent there,” he said. “The young ones are always smiling and they always want to train, which is a good thing.\n\n“They don’t get paid big money, which can be a hindrance. But they must be trained to think like a professional, and that will be a big boost for Indian football.”\n\nFormer Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who is now FIFA’s chief of Global Football Development, recently observed that there is a “gold mine” of football talent in India that needs to be tapped so that the country can play a more significant role on the world stage.\n\nRiise agreed with that sentiment.\n\n“I see young players, eager players, who can do wonders. All that is needed is to show them the proper way to excel at the highest level.”\n\nRiise, who won the 2005 Champions League and 2006 FA Cup with Liverpool, and was until last year in charge of top-tier Norwegian women’s side Avaldsnes IL, believes that is where he can step in and shape up the Indian football team.\n\n“I can make them understand what they need to take their game to the next level,” he said.\n\nNoted football commentator John Dykes, who was involved with the ISL in its formative years a decade ago, also believes “there is a lot of potential” in Indian football.\n\n“But the expectations are too high,” he said. “What the Indian media broadcasts and how the team performs, like at the Asian cup, can be vastly different.\n\n“What India really needs to focus on is having a very competitive league, and the effects will trickle down to the grassroots level, where boys will want to shine and be stars.”\n\n“The fan base is huge and people are beginning to accept that football too can be a big draw just like cricket.”\n\nFormer Liverpool left-back John Arne Riise", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9a122ff6a677c12071721d88968225edfa22858147c8aa6ca993fb4a800c5ca3?w=825", "alt_text": "John Arne Riise (right) with sports presenter John Dykes (left) and ex-Singapore international Aleksandar Duric."}]}

He died on July 27, 2015, aged 83.\n\nThe Singapore-based Abdul Kalam Vision Society, dedicated to implementing the visionary ideals of Dr Kalam, also held a special lecture on the former president that morning.\n\n“We have 120 members and are service-oriented to the community,” said Mr Raj, who is a member of the society.\n\n“Our regular activities include tree planting, picking litter from the streets of Little India, cleaning beaches and providing free health screening to migrant workers.

Santosh Kumar\n\nButter chicken, one of India’s best-known dishes globally, is delicious and apparently also contentious, with two Indian restaurant chains doing battle in court over claims to its origins.\n\nThe lawsuit, which has become a hot topic in India, was brought by the family behind Moti Mahal, a famous Delhi restaurant brand that has counted late United States president Richard Nixon and India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru among its guests.\n\nIt claims founder Kundan Lal Gujral created the curry in the 1930s when the restaurant first opened in Peshawar before it moved to Delhi.\n\nIn a 2,752-page court filing, it has sued rival chain Daryaganj, accusing it of falsely claiming to have invented the dish as well as dal makhani, a lentil dish also laden with butter and cream.\n\nThe Gujral family is seeking US$240,000 ($320,000) in damages, also alleging that Daryaganj had copied the layout of Moti Mahal’s website and “the look and feel” of its restaurants.\n\n“You cannot take away somebody’s legacy. The dish was invented when our grandfather was in Pakistan,” said Mr Monish Gujral, managing director at Moti Mahal.\n\nDaryaganj, established in 2019, counters that its late family member Kundan Lal Jaggi had partnered with Mr Gujral to open the Delhi restaurant in 1947, and the dish was invented there. That gives it the right to also lay claim to the creation of the dish, it argues.\n\nDaryaganj shared with Reuters a faded, handwritten partnership document registered in 1949 to back its argument.\n\nThe dispute has captured the nation’s attention with Indian TV broadcasters running segments on the history of the dish.\n\n“It’s an offbeat, unique case. You really don’t know who created the first dish of butter chicken. The court will be hard-pressed and will need to rely on circumstantial evidence,” said Mr Ameet Datta, an intellectual property lawyer at India’s Saikrishna & Associates.\n\nTestimonies of people who can link the brand to the dish they consumed decades ago could be critical proof, Mr Datta added.\n\nMade with tandoor-cooked chicken pieces mixed in a tomato gravy with dollops of cream and butter, the dish was ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas, as rated by nearly 400,000 users.\n\nIt was the second-ranked Indian food after butter garlic naan.

She also had financial disputes with Sheena, whose father is Indrani’s former lover Siddhartha Das.\n\nThe 24-year-old was allegedly strangled to death in a car by Indrani, with help from her driver Shyamvar Rai and former husband Sanjeev Khanna. The body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.\n\nThe case involved shocking revelations and complexities, leading to the arrests of Indrani and her husband, British business tycoon Peter Mukerjea, in 2015.\n\nIn a first look at the documentary, Netflix released a compelling poster featuring the half-covered face of Indrani, creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue.\n\nThe documentary features Indrani, her children Vidhie and Mikhail, veteran journalists and lawyers spotlighting dysfunctional family dynamics and complex motivations.\n\nHelmed by directors Shaana Levy and Uraaz Bahl, the Netflix series will also reveal, for the first time, unsettling phone call recordings between Indrani, Peter, and his son Rahul Mukerjea, the prime witness in the case.\n\n“The documentary explores sensational family secrets, complicated relationships, buried connections and the possibility of millions of dollars at stake,” said Netflix, which promised an exclusive and candid narrative directly from the central figure, Indrani.\n\nAfter her arrest, Indrani was sent to judicial custody at a women’s prison in Mumbai.\n\nThe CBI took over the case and filed charges against her, including murder, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe docuseries comes months after Indrani’s 2023 memoir Unbroken: The Untold Story.\n\nIn the book, the media-maven-turned-murder-accused recounts her life, as well as her six years in prison. She is currently out on bail.\n\nThe autobiography laid bare the details of her life journey, recounting her formative years in Guwahati, experiences in 1980s Kolkata, rise to prominence in Mumbai’s media landscape and the 2,460 days spent as prisoner 1468 in Byculla jail.\n\nThe book also highlighted the pivotal moment on Aug 25, 2015, when her life took an unexpected turn with accusations of her daughter’s murder.\n\nDespite spending six years in jail, Indrani continues to face trials for her daughter’s murder. The Supreme Court’s decision to grant her bail in 2022 acknowledged the prolonged nature of the case, signalling that its resolution is likely to be protracted.\n\nThe Indrani Mukerjea Story: Buried Truth comes months after Netflix’s Curry and Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case made news.\n\nThe 2023 docuseries presents the story of Jolly Joseph, a woman from a small Kerala village, Koodathai, who allegedly killed six members of her family over 14 years.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/dd08a06d62206ecac75853ec903f8ab6253a9be50187d0e0e4adedebf85e5630?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nOne Bollywood star is in a skin-tight lycra, another is in a revealing bikini, while a young actress is engaged in an obscene act with a man.\n\nBut none of it is real.\n\nAll three images, however, were credible enough to unleash lust, vitriol and unsavoury comments, underlining the sophistication of generative artificial intelligence and the threats it poses to actresses across India.\n\nThe photos and video were deepfake, and went viral in a vibrant social mediascape that is struggling to come to grips with technology that can create convincing copies and upend real lives.\n\n“We need to address this as a community and with urgency before more of us are affected by such identity theft,” South Indian actress Rashmika Mandanna said in a post on X that garnered more than 6.2 million views.\n\nShe is not the only Bollywood star to be cloned and attacked on social media, with stars such as Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif, Alia Bhatt, Deepika Padukone and Sunny Leone also targeted.\n\nWhile digitally manipulated images and videos of women were once easy to spot, usually lurking in the dark corners of the Internet, the explosion in generative AI tools such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E has made it easy and cheap to create and circulate convincing deepfakes.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of deepfake videos online are pornographic, according to tech experts, and most are of women, especially actresses.\n\n“The tools have become so much more sophisticated over the past six months to a year, which explains why we are seeing more of this content in India,” AI expert Aarti Samani told the BBC. “Many tools are available now, which allow you to create realistic synthetic images at little or no cost.”\n\nRecently, Mandanna, 27, had her face morphed onto an Instagram video featuring another woman in a black bodysuit. It went viral on social media, but a journalist at fact-checking platform Alt News reported that the video was a deepfake.\n\nThe lycra video, said Mandanna, was “extremely scary not only for me, but also for each one of us who today is vulnerable to so much harm because of how technology is being misused”.\n\nA video of megastar Priyanka also went viral recently. In this case, instead of changing her face, it was her voice that was substituted in a clip which promoted a brand, while also giving investment ideas.\n\nIt is not just actresses who are affected. Indian industrialist Ratan Tata recently had a deepfake video made of him giving investment advice.\n\nBut the trend does seem to be affecting women in particular.\n\nGoogle’s YouTube and Meta Platforms – which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – have updated their policies, requiring creators and advertisers to label all AI-generated content.\n\nBut the onus is largely on victims to take action, said Ms Rumman Chowdhury, an AI expert at Harvard University. “Generative AI will regrettably supercharge online harassment and malicious content, and women are the canaries in the coal mine. They are the ones impacted first, the ones on whom the technologies are tested,” she said.\n\n“It is an indication to the rest of the world to pay attention, because it’s coming for everyone.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“Many tools are available now, which allow you to create realistic synthetic images at little or no cost.”\n\nAI expert Aarti Samani", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6707a16ef05fb7c4cd3e76f712415dedd544d8cc58dd64c6131c3a3b9fcff529?w=825", "alt_text": "A video of British influencer Zara Patel with deepfake of actress Rashmika Mandanna has gone viral online."}]}

I ask him. To which his mother, Ms Manonmani Vasu, 48, chimes in: “Yes, waking up in the morning.”\n\nI find that hard to believe, of course, especially after learning about his numerous accolades and achievements in and out of the classroom.\n\nSanjay, a Singapore PR and student at the Global Indian International School-SMART campus, was certified last year as one of the “brightest students in the world by the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY)”.\n\nHe was honoured by the prestigious American institution for exceptional performance on the SAT, ACT, School and College Ability Test. CTY uses above-grade-level testing to identify advanced and academically-gifted students from around the world.\n\nCurrently in grade nine (Secondary 4 equivalent), Sanjay explains that he is supposed to be in grade seven this year, but was given a “jump” by his school.\n\n“It’s not really much of a difference. Age doesn’t really matter (in the classroom) as long as I act normal. I’m actually taller than half the boys in my class,” says Sanjay, who is 1.74m-tall and will turn 14 in July.\n\nThen there’s his prowess on the chessboard.\n\nOn March 17, he finished top in the under-14 category of the National School Individual chess tournament conducted by the Singapore Chess Federation.\n\nIt’s one of many feathers in Sanjay’s cap; over the past three years, he has travelled to countries like Georgia, Hungary and Spain for various chess tournaments. In placing consistently among the top players in those competitions, he has built his chess rating up to 1800.\n\n“The goal is to get to 2200 by next year,” he says.\n\nHis father, Mr Vasu Duraisamy, interjects: “(To be a) grandmaster is his ultimate goal; that might take another three years.”\n\nSanjay’s parents, who hail from Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, recall various moments where it struck them that their middle child might be a genius.\n\nPerhaps it was when he would complete higher-level maths assignments (past exam papers) put in front of him by his mother.\n\nOr when he proved “too quick” for his parents at chess soon after he began playing the game at age seven.\n\nOr perhaps it was a lot earlier, when Sanjay was still in kindergarten, and was handed an abacus. “Very quickly he could do additions and multiplications on it,” said Mr Vasu, 56, who works for a multinational corporation here.\n\nSanjay, with a shy grin, explains his predilection for mathematics: “It comes easily to me. I don’t like memorising things, I prefer learning through conceptual understanding. With maths, memorising formulas isn’t enough, you need to know how to work through the problems.”\n\nDespite his young age, Sanjay currently does maths at university level (Calculus BC), and is preparing for the Singapore Maths Olympiad in May, where he will compete in the senior category (up to A levels).\n\nHe is hoping to do well enough to qualify for the International Maths Olympiad next year.\n\nWhen asked what a typical week for him is like, Sanjay details his ultra-packed schedule, which includes chess training, piano classes, homework and even creating YouTube videos of maths and science tutorials (@MathandSciencewithSV).\n\nSanjay then points out that creating such videos are why he’s always up at night – hence, his waking up late.\n\n“Do you ever watch TV?” I ask him.\n\n“Not really, but if video games count, then yes,” he replies. “For relaxation, my go-to outlet is playing the piano. I also like playing basketball.”\n\nShort-term chess aspirations aside, Sanjay is coy when asked about his future plans. He explains he doesn’t yet have a specific career path in mind, other than to hopefully attend Harvard or MIT.\n\n“All we want for him is to be a good human being,” says Ms Vasu. “He should be friendly to everyone and humble. That’s the ultimate goal; other things can come after.”\n\nHe might have already achieved that, I tell her. Yet another feather in his cap.\n\n“(Maths) comes easily to me. I don’t like memorising things, I prefer learning through conceptual understanding.\n\nSanjay Vasu (above), who is in grade nine (Sec 4) at school though he is just 13.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/883f6c022dfad58b5b61acfe0ce300b0b94c76e6be7c57bd4d863c771c2af620?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndia’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, an unusual combination of diplomat, politician and public intellectual, is a globetrotter these days.\n\nOne of the Narendra Modi government’s most influential ministers, he is a key architect of the country’s foreign policy, regularly zipping across continents to meet national leaders for discussions on global issues.\n\nHis visits to Singapore have been few and far between since his tenure as India’s High Commissioner to the Republic from 2007 to 2009. Yet, he has fond memories of his time on the island.\n\n“I keep refreshing my acquaintance with Singapore and in many ways I marvel at how this country keeps pace with different aspects of development in the world,” he said during an interaction with about 600 members of the Indian community at One World International School in Punggol on March 24.\n\nDuring his term here, Singapore’s late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was serving as minister mentor, and Dr Jaishankar said Mr Lee was “very much still a presence at the time”.\n\n“I had quite a few opportunities to sit down and talk to him,” said the 69-year-old. “I still have notes from some of (those meetings). Those were, for me, very valuable learning experiences, because I have been in diplomacy for 41 years.\n\n“What I liked about him was that it would be very back and forth. If he found value, he was willing to also make it very interactive.”\n\nDr Jaishankar felt that what Mr Lee said and wrote over the years “continue to be of relevance”.\n\n“In a way, when our prime minister came here for his funeral (on March 29, 2015), it was an expression of what a lot of Indians actually thought about Mr Lee. It reflected a collective view of his contribution not just to Singapore, but I would say to Asia and perhaps even beyond.”\n\nKnown for his skilful diplomacy and strategic vision, Dr Jaishankar is Mr Modi’s “golden child”. In a government where the number of “experts” are limited, he has a firm grasp on his subject.\n\nA career diplomat, he climbed the ranks of the Ministry of External Affairs and reached the supreme post of foreign secretary (equivalent to permanent secretary in Singapore) – after having been ambassador in countries such as China and the United States.\n\nIn his second act, he emerged as a politician in his own right, close to Mr Modi in ideology.\n\nInterestingly, just two days before he was due to retire in 2015, Dr Jaishankar was appointed India’s foreign secretary. The phone call to the foreign secretary at the time, Ms Sujatha Singh, that her services were no longer required was reportedly made by India’s then External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. Four years later, Dr Jaishankar succeeded Mrs Swaraj in her ministerial post.\n\n“The transition from officer to minister wasn’t a transition, it was a quantum jump,” said Dr Jaishankar, adding that the way he had to function was very different.\n\n“The canvas of responsibility is much broader. It’s one thing to sit in the Parliament gallery and give information to your ministers or prepare your ministers in answering questions. Another is to actually participate in the politics in the House.\n\n“As the secretary, you were far more departmental. The moment you become a minister, the world opens up. There are many other issues, many other considerations... and your public contacts are much more.\n\n“(Being a minister) has also given me a somewhat different outlook. I’m sensitive to many more things than I would have been five years ago because of this responsibility.”\n\nDr Jaishankar is not the first Indian career diplomat to become foreign minister – Mr Natwar Singh had that honour – but he was the first former foreign secretary to be given political control of the External Affairs Ministry, and probably the first bureaucrat to become a cabinet minister so soon after retirement.\n\nConsidered one of the world’s best diplomats, Dr Jaishankar has built a reputation as a tough negotiator, yet exceptionally fair and who knows how to get a deal done.\n\nHe was India’s longest-serving ambassador to China, from June 2009 to December 2013.\n\nTop India expert Ashley Tellis from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace believes Dr Jaishankar is the best man to be India’s foreign minister.\n\n“He thinks strategically about India’s interests in a way that few do,” said Mr Tellis. “He can manage both the Ministry of External Affairs and other government of India bureaucracies better than most because he has come up from within their ranks.\n\n“Most importantly, the PM trusts him in ways that will allow him to implement Indian foreign policy without having to constantly look over his shoulder. And he has deep familiarity with the ‘great powers’ that India attempts to balance – the US, China, Russia and Japan.”\n\nDr Jaishankar said his work is not always simple or straightforward. “I’m supposed to go out, make friends, influence people and get people to agree with me mostly,” he said.\n\n“Occasionally you have disagreements and you manage them the best that you can. The world’s not always a courteous place. So you end up in situations where people put you under pressure.\n\n“Not everybody is as nice as you are, so you may have very difficult conversations. But that’s where, to some degree, experience and instincts come in.\n\n“If I can use a cricketing metaphor, if you see a yorker coming, you step out of the crease, and take it on the full. Then you know what to do with it.\n\n“So don’t let people come at you. Don’t let people put you on the defensive. Frankly, if you’re standing up for a country of 1.4 billion people, there is a certain responsibility that comes with it. There are times when you need to push back strongly.\n\n“There are times when you are more patient, and you say, ‘Don’t worry, sit down with me. Let me tell you that you haven’t fully understood what I’m trying to get to’. There is a way of doing that as well.\n\n“But in a more intensive social media-driven existence, I think at times you do need to behave like you’re in the IPL (cricket’s big-stage Indian Premier League).”\n\nDr Jaishankar is the 30th foreign minister of India since independence in 1947. Some leaders served as prime minister and foreign minister at the same time, but none of the former foreign ministers had a doctorate degree in international affairs to their credit.\n\nThis shows in how he tackles different viewpoints. “Diplomacy is about finding a way of reconciling different viewpoints and coming to some kind of agreement,” he explained.\n\n“So there will be issues where you have different viewpoints. There will be issues when they are used as a cover, as an excuse, as a justification. We should be able to spot the difference and figure out a way of dealing with it.\n\n“A lot of diplomacy is being able to have different relationships with different powers of people. You have to manage the different relationships. If two (people) have a problem getting along, you have to figure out a way of when to step in and when not to step in.\n\n“That’s really what a country like India does in terms of managing the world.”\n\nIndia’s External Affairs Minister S.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe city may have been the setting and backdrop for the 2008 Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire, but don’t let Mumbai fool you.\n\nIndia’s financial capital has emerged as home to the most number of billionaires in Asia, surpassing Beijing, a report said on March 26.\n\nAccording to the Hurun Global Rich List, Mumbai is home to 92 billionaires, compared with Beijing’s 91.\n\nThe Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute (HRI) also said Mumbai is third on the overall list, after New York (119) and London (97).\n\nThere are now more billionaires in Mumbai’s 603 sq km than in Beijing’s 16,000 sq km.\n\nMumbai has overtaken China’s political and cultural capital because of the 26 new billionaires it added during the past year. Beijing, in the same time, has seen 18 billionaires drop out of the list on a net basis.\n\nThe Indian city’s total billionaire wealth stands at US$445 billion ($600 billion), with a 47 per cent increase from the previous year, while Beijing’s total billionaire wealth amounts to US$265 billion, a 28 per cent decrease.\n\nMumbai’s wealth sectors include energy and pharmaceuticals, with billionaires like Mukesh Ambani making significant gains. Real estate player Mangal Prabhat Lodha and family was Mumbai’s biggest wealth gainer in percentage terms – 116 per cent.\n\nAmbani has US$115 billion in assets, followed by Gautam Adani with US$86 billion, reported The Times of India.\n\nIndia last year added 94 people to its list of 271 billionaires, the report stated. The country now has the highest number of billionaires outside the US.\n\nAccording to media reports, Mr Rupert Hoogewerf, the chairman and chief researcher of HRI, said that the increase is evidence of the rising confidence in the Indian economy.\n\nThe aggregate wealth of billionaires in India is an astounding US$1 trillion, which represents 7 per cent of the world’s billionaire wealth and highlights the country’s significant economic sway.\n\nChina tops the overall list with 814 billionaires, but its number has shrunk by 155 from 2022 as the country’s real estate and renewable energy sectors struggled to grow, and its stock markets remained weak.\n\nThe US added 109 to take second place with a total of 800 billionaires.\n\nForeign businesses’ direct investment into China last year increased by the lowest amount since the early 1990s, highlighting Beijing’s challenges to spur its economy. It also has to contend with a steadily accelerating outflow of manufacturing as Apple and other American brands begin to position new capacity in countries from India to South-east Asia to mitigate risks from US-China tensions.\n\nMumbai’s population stands at around 21 million. With a median income of about Rs20,000 a month ($323) or around Rs240,000 a year, these astronomical number of billions clearly underscores the salient income gap between the richest and the poorest in the country.\n\nThe backdrop for the Slumdog Millionaire movie, about a teenager from the slums whose memories of childhood aid him with the questions on a million-dollar game show, Mumbai also depicts a parallel universe.\n\nThe city has the highest number of high net worth individuals (those with assets over US$1 million) in the country. It is the financial centre of India and home to the Bombay Stock Exchange, the 10th largest stock exchange in the world.\n\nMumbai’s wealthy neighbourhoods are unique compared to the rest of the world in that there are sections of extreme poverty located within and around it. More than 60 per cent of the population live in slums.\n\nAmbani’s 400,000 sq ft, 27-storey house, for instance, is the world’s second-most expensive home after Buckingham Palace. It is situated right next to the Golibar slum in central Mumbai.\n\nOn the global rich list, Indian billionaires have seen a slight drop in world ranking.

I had no interest in sports – I just wanted to come back home after school and play the yo-yo,” Karthik, now 23, told tabla!\n\n“The art of yo-yo does not just involve manipulating strings; it requires choreography, music, momentum and sync.”\n\nHe got so skilled with the string device that he competed in the Asia-Pacific Yo-Yo Championships just four months after he picked up the hobby.\n\nWhile he did not clinch top spot at the tournament, the experience heightened his passion.\n\n“I was more excited about being up on stage than winning. It was a great opportunity to meet and mingle with the champions from Japan, Korea and other Asian countries,” he said.\n\nDetermined to perfect his craft, Karthik immersed himself in practice and competition, setting his sights on becoming the yo-yo champion of Singapore.\n\nHis dedication paid off when he won the junior bracket at the Singapore Yo-Yo Championships in 2015, earning recognition within the local scene.\n\n“At these tournaments, competitors are judged across eight categories, including string control, trick diversity, execution and choreography,” Karthik explained. “You’re given a performance time of three minutes each.”\n\nKarthik’s ambitions didn’t stop there. He dreamt of competing on the international stage, and over the next two years, honed his skills – practising up to four hours a day – and placed consistently in the top three in various competitions, including the 2018 Asia-Pacific Yo-Yo Championships, where he was the sole Singaporean to make the final round.\n\nToday, Karthik shares his love for the yo-yo with the younger generation, volunteering at workshops organised by the Yo-Yo Association of Singapore.\n\n“I do think yo-yo should be considered an official sport (in Singapore). Competitors spend days constructing routines just to represent and put the country on the big stage,” Karthik said.\n\n“The construction of a routine is not so simple, and it really challenges you to come out of your comfort zone.\n\n“If everyone can watch and see how beautiful a yo-yo routine can be and appreciate the art, I think it will some day be considered an official sport.”\n\n“It is definitely a mental game,” Karthik added. “Believe in your passion, even if it’s a niche, and keep going.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5a28ce3575f5208469eed5f18453fe021eff89d0a4ad668b1dc90c6e7743a068?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The Telangana-born player has now bagged a goal in each of his 25th, 50th, 75th, 100th, 125th and 150th match representing the country.\n\nHis latest strike takes his tally to within 12 of the 106 international goals scored by third-placed Argentinian great Lionel Messi.

I’m very fortunate, extremely thankful and highly privileged to be in this state.

Santosh Kumar\n\nEven before the Malayalam film Aadujeevitham (The Goat Life) released in theatres on March 28, reports about it being “superbly done” surfaced online, after the makers organised a special screening for noted artistes from the Telugu film industry in Hyderabad.\n\n“Watched a gem of a film. A visual spectacle,” said journalist Suresh PRO on X, among other effusive blurbs.\n\nThe film, directed by Blessy and starring Prithviraj Sukumaran in the lead role, tells the real-life story of Najeeb, a Malayali immigrant who was forced into slavery as a goat heard on a secluded farm in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA labourer from Aarattupuzha village in Haripad, Kerala, Najeeb had set off to the Gulf in 1993 for better prospects, leaving behind his pregnant wife and son.\n\nHe was promised a job at a supermarket in Saudi Arabia, but ended up herding goats for more than two years in the barren outskirts of a Saudi village.\n\nThe owners exploited him, refusing to even pay him for his labour. He was not allowed to bathe and was fed only stale pita bread and goat’s milk.\n\nIsolated and under constant surveillance, Najeeb’s existence became a haunting tale of exploitation and captivity in the unforgiving desert.\n\nHis story came to light thanks to Malayalam author Benyamin, whose 2008 book Aadujeevitham became a best-seller in India and won numerous literary awards.\n\nPrithviraj said that, when director Blessy approached him with the role back in 2008, the story had just hit the mainstream and several filmmakers across the country had their eyes on the book to make a film out of it.\n\n“Blessy managed to procure the rights and for some reason he thought I should play Najeeb,” Prithviraj told Pinkvilla.\n\n“It was a big commitment and a big responsibility because it’s about a life that someone lived. This is a true story and the person you see in this film is still among us. I knew I’d be putting myself through drastic physical and mental torture to be able to pull this off.”\n\nPrithviraj told indianexpress.com about how he “evolved” in the 16 years since he signed on to do the film.\n\n“I said yes to the film in 2008- 2009, which means it’s now been about 16 years,” he said. “When I said yes to this film. I wasn’t married. Obviously, I wasn’t a father. I had not turned director. I had not turned producer. My life has evolved through all these phases, and throughout, one constant has been that this film is there.\n\n“So, on March 28, it’s a culmination of a lot of things; it is a life experience for me.”\n\nWhile Blessy and Prithviraj, along with the film’s crew, began shooting Aadujeevitham in 2018, they had to take a break due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPrithviraj himself went through a massive physical transformation. He admitted that achieving Najeeb’s look took a toll on his body as he had to sometimes fast for 72 hours at a stretch.\n\nHe told the Hindustan Times: “The idea was that I looked like somebody who was starving most of the time. The only way I could do that was to actually adopt that process. I would drink water and black coffee, but nothing else.”\n\nNajeeb told Manorama online that he cried during many scenes and felt that Prithviraj truly captured the essence of his hardship.\n\n“The kind of torture I faced is exactly how it is shown in Aadujeevitham,” he said.\n\nHe recounted a particular scene when he cries out for his wife in his sleep, reflecting on the goosebumps he experienced when watching Prithviraj portray that moment. Najeeb said hearing Prithviraj’s screams in the film brought tears to his eyes.\n\nAadujeevitham also stars Amala Paul, with A.R.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMany healthy individuals suffer from heavy eyelids, which is usually due to fatigue or spending too much time in front of a computer screen.\n\nAllergies, infections and certain medical conditions can also cause heavy, droopy eyelids.\n\nAfter a long day at work, we generally feel our eyelids getting heavier, as if something is pulling them down. But what causes the eyes to get heavy?\n\n“To understand this, it is important to understand the basic anatomy of the eye,” said Mumbai-based ophthalmologist and aesthetic surgeon Sneha Shah.\n\n“The eyelids are comprised of thin layers of skin and muscles which play a crucial role in protecting its delicate structures from external elements like dust, debris and bright light. They also greatly contribute to the overall appearance and expressiveness of the face.\n\n“The muscles around the eyes also experience fatigue after a long day of consistent use. This is particularly true for ocular and brow muscles since they are the most active during our waking hours. In general, the heaviness of the eyelids in otherwise healthy individuals is due to fatigue that these muscles experience during the hours we are awake.”\n\nWhat causes sleepy eyes\n\nMuscle fatigue: A prolonged period of staying awake can lead to a loss of tone and firmness in the eyelids, causing them to droop or sag.\n\nReduced blood flow and inactivity: These cause the eyes to feel heavy, bags to appear under the eyes and dark circles to form.\n\nStress and tension: Intense visual focus can strain the muscles around the eyes.\n\nFacial expressions: When we feel tired, our facial muscles tend to slacken, leading to our expressions becoming less animated and lively.\n\nAll these can also occur as a result of ageing around the eyes. It may be accelerated by chronic exposure to the sun and the harmful light from our gadgets.\n\nTreatment for sleepy eyes\n\nMassage around the eyes: It can help release strain and make you feel better. This can be done by using your fingertips or gua sha (the practice of using a tool to apply pressure and scrape the skin to relieve pain and tension).\n\nGet adequate sleep: Get at least eight hours of sleep a day to allow your body and eyes to rest and rejuvenate completely.\n\nStay hydrated: Drink lots of water throughout the day to keep yourself hydrated, as dehydration can exacerbate the feelings of fatigue and heaviness in the eyes.\n\nTake breaks from the screen: Take regular breaks from the screen to reduce eye strain. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet (6m) away for at least 20 seconds to give your eyes a break.\n\nApply cold compresses: Apply a cold compress or chilled cucumber slices to the eyes for a few minutes to reduce puffiness and soothe tired eyes. The cold temperature helps to constrict blood vessels and reduce inflammation.\n\nImpact of sleepy eyes on overall health\n\nSleepy eyes can result in difficulty in staying alert, decreased productivity and even safety hazards like impaired driving. Prolonged periods of inadequate sleep can also contribute to mood disturbances, such as irritability, anxiety and depression.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/eaf6a912470ddb1d482083446ff7b0d5c547569f2a955942ac2d8b39ce43b0cc?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Sometimes called kaya jam, it replaced the Western fruit jam in the sandwich.\n\nEaten on its own or as a set with two soft-boiled eggs and local coffee or tea with sweet condensed milk, kaya toast started off as a breakfast item.\n\nIt is said to have been first served at Singapore’s oldest Hainanese coffee shop that opened along Killiney Road in 1919.\n\nToday, kaya toast can be found at practically every coffee shop, foodcourt and hawker centre, and is well-loved by all races.\n\nIts popularity is surprising when you consider that eating sliced bread is a novelty for some locals.\n\nThe Indians would normally start their day with thosai and idli, the Malays with their nasi lemak and mee siam and the Chinese with their noodles and porridge.\n\nWhile the North Indians might have bread in the morning, this would be naan or chapati, and not sliced white bread layered with kaya and butter.\n\nFrom being a breakfast staple, kaya toast is now enjoyed throughout the day. So much so, it was promoted by the Singapore Tourism Board as a uniquely Singaporean tradition.\n\nIn June 2021, South Korean convenience store chain CU sold kaya toast at all of its stores as part of its “Singapore Gourmet Trip” series.\n\nThen in October 2021, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued commemorative coins that featured kaya toast, along with other local dishes, to celebrate the inscription of Singapore’s hawker culture into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nLet’s hope Singapore’s soul food sandwich becomes as globally prevalent as French toast, and then it will be on everyone’s lips.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/524f89d737082bf3714d077a223e216ee97f257fff6a11e3bc6b0fd6f4badee3?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Former Singapore international football player.\n\nAli Kasim\n\nWhen Singapore’s football team took to the field against China in a World Cup qualifier at the National Stadium last night, the game must have surely brought back memories for Ramasamy Krishnan.\n\nOne of the 72-year-old’s proudest moments was at the old National Stadium in 1974 when he donned his country’s colours in a match against China. A speedy left winger back in the day, Krishnan – or Roy as he’s affectionately known – netted Singapore’s shock equaliser in the 1-1 draw.\n\nThough the memories of his playing days are a little hazy, he still recalls the moment vividly.\n\n“It was in the second half, my teammate (Quah) Kim Song was waiting for the ball, but if I played it to him and ran, I’d be offside. So I went through (the defence), faked the goalkeeper to one side and scored,” he tells tabla!.\n\n“Everyone was surprised. Nobody knew who this China team was because it was their first time playing outside their country. They were a really good team.”\n\nLike many celebrated local footballers back in the day, Krishnan was talent-spotted at the famous Farrer Park field in the early 70s, during the heyday of Singapore football.\n\nKnown for his blistering pace on the wing, he played a prominent role in numerous Malaysia Cup campaigns and thrilled fans with his scintillating dribbles, elastic body feints and sudden acceleration; his pinpoint crosses from the left often a threat to opposing defenders.\n\nSadly, it was a career that lasted just under six years, until injuries – to both knees – forced Krishnan into retirement in 1977.\n\n“I made a comeback in 1978, but was not the same. I was slow already,” he says. “So, I played on for another one, two years and I called it quits.”\n\nWhen memories of his playing days fail him, Krishnan turns to his weighty tome of newspaper clippings, stashed conveniently under a coffee table in his Shunfu Road flat, just metres away from a glass cabinet stock-filled with trophies and medals from his glory years.\n\nFlipping through the pages of clippings, he points at one and tells me about his national team debut against Burma in 1971 at Malaysia’s Merdeka Stadium, where the Lions won 1-0.\n\nThen there was the time he bagged the top scorer award during a Vietnam National Day quadrangular tournament. “Four or five goals I scored in that one,” he says.\n\nI ask him about the match where he twisted his right knee – and ultimately, his footballing fate. He does not recall the opposition or the venue, but assures me he was playing for Singapore at the time. “I was on the ball, an opponent came so I turned and twisted my knee. I tore my cartilage.”\n\nKrishnan later also injured his left knee in similar fashion at Jalan Besar Stadium.\n\n“I went for surgery on both knees, so the cartilage on both have been removed. When I tried playing again after that, it was difficult. I had to build back the muscle. One part of the leg was strong, but the other part (above the knee) was lembik (weak) like tahu.”\n\nAfter retiring, Krishnan – who had his first name shortened to Roy by a British journalist during a training tour in England – went into coaching, first at local club Pioneer Arsenal and later Jurong FC, as an assistant coach to ex-international V. Sundramoorthy.\n\nAt Jurong, Krishnan also doubled up as the team’s kit man, making sure jerseys were ready for matches and that refreshments were at hand all around the training ground.\n\nIn 2003, when Jurong pulled out from the league, Krishnan found himself jobless. Thankfully, a referral from Sundram landed him a job at S. League side Albirex Niigata (S), a satellite Japanese team who entered the league that same year.\n\nKrishnan remains with Albirex as their logistics manager. The club recently presented him with a long service award of 21 years along with a bonus cheque.\n\n“I wanted to retire earlier, but the club told me to wait until I hit 21 years, so they can give me the award,” he says half-jest. “Now I’m still with them, but (on a) part-time (basis).”\n\nAlbirex chairman Daisuke Korenaga said the club is “truly grateful” Krishnan has been with them for so long.\n\n“He has been with us since the days of Jurong FC, who used our home stadium, Jurong East Stadium, before Albirex Niigata Singapore was established,” Korenaga said.\n\n“He knows the club well and also the history of Singapore football, so his presence has always been an asset to us.”\n\nThese days, Krishnan, now conspicuously bow-legged, has to use a walking stick whenever he’s outdoors. His knees don’t hurt, he says, but he does have to watch his diet – a requirement his wife ensures he adheres to.\n\n“But I don’t regret anything, even (having to) walk around with a stick,” he says, as he flips through his album of news clippings.\n\n“Ahh, here – the goal I scored against China,” he says, sitting up excitedly while pointing to a polaroid photo in black and white.\n\nPhotos: Sundara Nataraaj\n\n“Everyone was surprised. Nobody knew who this China team was because it was their first time playing outside their country.

Santosh Kumar\n\nSnake venom addiction, a lesser-known yet potent form of substance dependency, is making headlines in India after popular YouTuber Elvish Yadav was arrested for allegedly organising rave parties and providing the drug.\n\nHe was remanded to 14-day judicial custody on March 17.\n\nThe winner of reality show Bigg Boss OTT faces a case under the Wildlife Act in Noida, a city in Uttar Pradesh near New Delhi, after he admitted to the charges, police said.\n\nA snake smuggling racket was busted in November last year after police raided a banquet hall in Noida. Five people, including four snake charmers, were arrested for allegedly supplying snake venom. Nine snakes including cobras were also seized.\n\nThe raid followed a complaint by a non-governmental organization (NGO) after a member laid a trap and contacted Yadav for snake venom. The NGO member was given a phone number which led him to the five accused, said police.\n\nA forensic investigation revealed the use of venom, from a cobra or krait species, in drugs supplied at the party. The arrested people named Yadav as their “supplier”.\n\nThe 26-year-old, who had earlier denied involvement, admitted that he had met the accused at different rave parties and was in contact with them, NDTV reported.\n\nNoida Police on March 20 also arrested two associates of Yadav after their names surfaced during investigations.\n\n“Those arrested have been identified as Ishwar, 50, and Vinay Yadav, 25,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Shakti Mohan Avasthy told PTI. “Ishwar runs a banquet hall in Gurugram while Vinay is a social media influencer and close friend of Elvish Yadav.\n\n“Both have been booked under the same charges as Elvish Yadav, which include the consumption of drugs, organising such parties and trafficking of wildlife species.”\n\nYadav is also accused of using snakes in his video shoots for YouTube. He had earlier told police that snakes seen in his video were arranged by Bollywood singer Fazilpuria, sources told NDTV.\n\nPolice are concerned that young ravers in India are turning to cobra venom to get high at parties.\n\nNDTV reported that youths are increasingly using snake venom as a substitute for traditional drugs, after discovering that highs can last for several days.\n\nSuicides due to drug and alcohol addiction in India have tripled since 2011. Nausea, vomiting and dizziness often plague addicts, as their bodies struggle to cope with the toxic effects of snake venom.\n\nRepeated injections of venom can lead to severe tissue necrosis and scarring, resulting in long-term health complications. Addicts may also suffer from neurological symptoms such as seizures, paralysis and cognitive impairment.\n\nWildlife activists also point out that the process of getting hold of snake venom is incredibly challenging. Snake charmers are called in to coax it out of cobras.\n\nThe snakes, which are often injected with chemicals to make them produce more venom, are made to either it spit out or bite a person on the foot.\n\nThe process of venom extraction can be incredibly harmful for the snakes themselves.\n\nAshar, a legal adviser with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in India, told The Times: “They are often starved and have their teeth yanked out to make it safer for the handler.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/466234206b5a4e999e62aa9e3df7698d045f1c7792a08786591315d70bbaa5b0?w=825", "alt_text": "Several videos have surfaced showing YouTuber Elvish Yadav holding snakes."}]}

Is it like a pastry?” asks a middle-aged Malay woman decked in traditional baju kurung and a headscarf.\n\nStall owner Krishan Prakash Nambiar patiently explains his creations while sprinkling shredded cheddar on a jacket potato, which he also sells at his stall.\n\nThe 27-year-old is helming a food stand for the first time at the annual Ramadan bazaar, and admits he does get overwhelmed at times by the crowd.\n\n“We usually have stalls at the Deepavali bazaars, and it’s crowded there too – but it’s definitely much more packed here,” he tells tabla!\n\n“We didn’t expect this at all so we’re really busy every day, and we’re bringing in stocks continuously.”\n\nCelebrated for its lively atmosphere and diverse range of goods, the Geylang Serai Bazaar is back in full swing, running daily from 10am to midnight until April 9, the eve of Hari Raya Puasa.\n\nThe bazaar’s stalls – fully sheltered and with a main dining area – are smack-middle of the Wisma Geylang Serai hub. There are about 500 stalls and around 150 of them offer food and drink, while the rest sell clothes, decorations and Hari Raya goodies.\n\nMuch like in previous years, the popular stalls draw lengthy queues that usually begin snaking from 6pm, when the bulk of the crowd purchase food for their breaking of fast.\n\nStalls selling popular Indian street food are making some headway into that elite group. Aside from the pani puri, patrons are flocking to stalls selling traditional Indian foods like vadai and biryani, as well as less conventional ones (Fooditude) selling prata waffles.\n\n“The pani puri is very convenient to eat on the go as we walk around the place,” said Miss Qisha Anthony, 31, referring to a set of six crispy golden-brown spheres filled with mint water that she’s holding in a takeaway box.\n\n“And I love the taco puri (from the Mr Pani Puri stall). It’s minced beef and potato filling, drizzled with mayonnaisel; so good,” she adds.\n\nOther Indian-influenced highlights include the Ministry of Rojak, various kebab stalls – there are about five of them – and of course, biryani.\n\nAt the bazaar, you can opt for the dish in two ways – in a copper pot (Sheikh Allauddin Copper Pot Biryani) or inside a bamboo (Bamboo Biryani).\n\nAfter 15 minutes, I finally get to the front of the Chai O’Clock queue, and order the dahi-puri ($7 for five pieces).\n\n“Our pani puri is special,” says Mr Krishan. “We actually have a special recipe that I shouldn’t reveal, but it’s okay, I’ll share it with you. We actually add pomegranate at the end, which makes it a little unique.\n\n“It definitely won’t taste like the normal pani puri that you get in India because it has a Singaporean touch to it.”\n\n“Next year I want to try selling more Indian items, like pav bhaji.”\n\nThat’s awesome, I think to myself. But he might also need a sign explaining what that is – so the line can move faster.\n\n“We usually have stalls at the Deepavali bazaars, and it’s crowded there too – but it’s definitely much more packed here.”\n\nChai O’ Clock stall owner Krishan Prakash Nambiar.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a1ca3d49b7e41e2baed6c20579ea54dffb01ee66fbc390f32f213b011da32a1e?w=825", "alt_text": "The Chai O’ Clock and Bamboo Biryani stalls get busy during peak hours at the Geylang Serai Bazaar."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRare and precious recipes belonging to the Peranakan Indian community, also known as the Chitty Melaka, have been recorded for posterity in a colourful, 200-page book.\n\nHeritage Food Of The Peranakan Indians In A Chitty Melaka Kitchen contains about 100 recipes, contributed by 10 matriarchs from the community.\n\nIt is one of more than 550 projects supported by the National Heritage Board’s (NHB) Heritage Grants Scheme since its launch in 2013.\n\nThe scheme comprises minor (up to 50 per cent of total project costs, or a maximum of $50,000) and major (up to 50 per cent of total project costs or a maximum of $150,000) project grants.\n\nSeveral community-led projects that have benefited from the scheme, which has awarded more than $15 million, include publications, exhibitions and podcasts that promote local heritage.\n\nThe Chitty Melakans, or Chettis, are descendants of South Indian merchants who first settled in Melaka around the 15th century and married a spouse of Malay or Chinese descent. The Indian Heritage Centre estimates the number of Chettis in Singapore at 5,000.\n\nAs the community’s traditions began to wane and its numbers dwindled, so too did the safe-keeping of traditional Peranakan recipes. Eventually, there were only a handful who knew the recipes. Most of them are now in their seventies and eighties.\n\nMerlin Pillay, 71, who contributed six recipes, described the NHB support as a “blessing”.\n\nShe told tabla! that the idea for a cookbook was mooted to the members of the Peranakan Indian (Chitty Melaka) Association Singapore (PIA) by a news editor from Malaysia four years ago, during a Peranakan convention in Melaka.\n\nDespite the initial excitement, Ms Pillay said it was only in 2022 that the PIA decided to apply for an NHB grant. In October that year, after a new committee was formed, work on the book began.\n\n“In 2024, we went full throttle. Every week, we tried out the recipes. These were from our grandmother’s generation and before, and were not often cooked,” said Ms Merlin. “Each dish has a meaning and a story behind it. We have included everything in the book.”\n\nAccording to Ms Merlin, more than 1,700 copies of the book have been sold. The association is planning a reprint.\n\nSome of the recipes are enhanced with interactive media by Lasalle College of the Arts students, and can be accessed by scanning the QR codes.\n\nMs Kavitah Jayanandan, 47, finds the book useful in educating people about her community. Having studied Malay instead of Tamil in school, she had found it difficult to introduce her heritage to her peers.\n\n“Many people hear Chitty Melakans and ask ‘oh what’s that?’ They are not as familiar with Chitty Melakans, also known as Peranakan Indians, as they are with Peranakan Chinese or the Nyonya,” the media business owner said.\n\n“Now I have something tangible to show what a Chitty Melakan is.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/33229920016896926395a00d98b9805cbc25727e9c203dc212a8f8db77b9733f?w=825", "alt_text": "The cookbook contains about 100 Peranakan-Indian recipes."}]}

It left his fans drooling and wanting more.”\n\nOn the red carpet, KP polled celebrities on their expectations of the awards, what they were most looking forward to and their upcoming projects. It was all part of Zee’s coverage for its international viewers.\n\n“It was truly one of those experiences where you feel you were born to do it,” said KP. “It didn’t feel alien, it felt so organic.\n\n“It was truly a matter of pride that a Singaporean got to do such a big Bollywood event.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndia’s top food delivery app on March 20 shelved plans to start a dedicated vegetarian fleet on fears it could jeopardise the safety of its drivers and put customers at risk of eviction.\n\nFood consumption is deeply political in India, where many practising Hindus maintain that a vegetarian diet is necessary to maintain “purity”.\n\nSome residential associations (RWA) in India will lease only to people who say they are vegetarian, and Hindu activist groups have in the past forcefully demanded the closure of restaurants serving meat during religious festivals.\n\nMany Hindus at the top of the faith’s rigid caste hierarchy also avoid eating at restaurants that serve meat, even if vegetarian alternatives are offered.\n\nZomato, the most successful platform for home food deliveries, announced plans on March 19 to cater to that market by rolling out a separate, strictly meat-free service.\n\nThe fleet was to be easily identifiable, with its motorbike riders wearing green uniforms instead of Zomato’s usual red corporate livery.\n\nBut that, in turn, rendered customers who eat meat identifiable through the red fleet that delivered food to their homes.\n\nThe company revised their plans a day later after online backlash, with founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal admitting the company had failed to think through the safety implications.\n\nMr Goyal said having a separate, colour-coded fleet risked drivers getting into altercations in residential areas that maintained a de facto vegetarian policy.\n\n“Our riders’ physical safety is of paramount importance to us,” he wrote in a post on social media platform X.\n\n“We now realise that even some of our customers could get into trouble with their landlords, and that would not be a nice thing if that happened because of us.\n\n“While we are going to continue to have a fleet for vegetarians, we have decided to remove the on-ground segregation of this fleet (and) using the colour green.”\n\nMr Goyal’s announcement of the new fleet was roundly criticised on social media, with many warning it risked entrenching food-based discrimination.\n\n“It wasn’t enough that our food is considered a sin to eat, us filthy for eating it and to be discriminated for cooking or ordering it at home. Now we watch as RWAs with their history of great decisions allow only ‘pure veg fleet’ to reach houses,” a user wrote.\n\n“If Zomato uses different coloured boxes to deliver veg food, bigoted landlords can harass tenants if they see non-green colours. Whatever assurance of veg fleet if needed must be kept inside the app only,” another user cautioned.\n\nQuestions were raised about the potential extension of the veg-only policy to delivery personnel. “So how long before they decide the driver of veg food must also be a vegetarian?” asked one user.\n\nOne user warned the new colour-coded system risked outing Zomato customers as covert meat-eaters, potentially upsetting their landlords.\n\n“Many tenants in societies and standalone houses don’t disclose to landlords that they eat meat,” the user wrote in reply to the scheme’s announcement.\n\nNearly 40 per cent of Indians abstain from eating meat according to a Pew survey – by far the highest rate out of any country.\n\nAFP, Indo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/38663b7f3dc25b31ac1e1d2f74700ca34821de66a66325048058a135303301b4?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBombay Brasserie was founded in 1982 in Kensington, London, by the Indian Hotels Company (IHCL), South Asia’s largest hospitality brand, with the aim of redefining Indian fine dining and showcasing the authentic flavours of Bombay and Indian cuisine.\n\nAfter opening branches in Dubai and Cape Town, it has ventured into Singapore, setting up a Paris-style chic outlet at South Beach.\n\n“Unlike our other locations which emphasise Indian fine dining, Bombay Brasserie in Singapore offers a selection of Indian and Continental cuisines within the sophisticated setting of a Parisian brasserie,” said Mr Taljinder Singh, senior vice-president and brand Custodian, IHCL.\n\n“Located in the heart of the city, it harmonises classic and contemporary culinary elements, drawing inspiration from Parsi cafes, seafood eateries, renowned chaat vendors and the subtle nuances of European gastronomy.”\n\nBombay Brasserie’s concept in Singapore pays homage to Bombay’s eclectic dining scene while infusing it with the elegance of a European brasserie.\n\nHelmed by chef Nilesh Ambedkar, the restaurant features signature dishes like chatka crab legs and butter chicken, each meticulously crafted with authentic ingredients and cooking methods.\n\nA menu highlight is the specially curated chaat selection, featuring the popular Indian street food reinvented for a refined dining experience.\n\nThe tandoor menu presents a unison of flavours cooked using century-old techniques.\n\n“This unique combination of tradition and innovation sets Bombay Brasserie apart as a destination for culinary enthusiasts seeking an extraordinary dining experience,” said Mr Singh.\n\n“With a legacy spanning four decades, our extensive menu ensures our offerings resonate with the diverse tastes of our patrons.”\n\nWhile preserving classic Indian favourites such as Kashmiri rogan josh, patrani macchi and rajma chawal, the Singapore outlet has introduced an array of European dishes, such as lobster thermidor and steak au poivre.\n\nThe tandoor items include prawns, crab and cauliflower.\n\n“From seafood platters to crepes suzette and snake coffee (speciality coffee roasted to exhibit flavours such as caramel, hazelnut and chocolate), our menu has both traditional and innovative flavours,” said Mr Singh.\n\n“The ambience captures the essence of Bombay’s Parsi and Anglo-Indian heritage, creating an inviting space for intimate dinners, casual lunches or joyous celebrations with loved ones.”\n\nThe restaurant’s beverage range includes cocktails such as The Bombay Blazer and Queen’s Necklace, all inspired by the colonial era of Bombay and telling tales of the vibrant neighbourhoods they hail from.\n\nIts design combines the aesthetic of Bombay’s Parsi and Anglo-Indian elements with the classic charm of a French brasserie.\n\n“This is not a restaurant that conjures up Indo-French or a fusion menu,” said Mr Singh. “It is steadfast on quality of the taste of the comfort foods that it serves.”\n\nLe Tandoor Crab\n\nPhoto: Indian Hotels Company\n\nLes Plats Camembert Spinach Kofta\n\nPhoto: Indian Hotels Company", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6f3519a38b7e182d9b37e2f0e053a36b9e4c9698a81f5d605e0a6245948d5309?w=825", "alt_text": "The chic interior."}]}

While her mother, who is a heart patient, suffers from diabetes, thyroid and has liver issues.\n\nMr Janarthan was five years old when he was diagnosed with autism. When he was a toddler, Ms Porchelvi took him to a speech therapist after noticing he could not talk properly. He also has weak limbs, needs help with showering and spends most of his time at home.\n\n“Janarthan randomly throws tantrums and his mood swings easily. Only my mum and I can understand his emotions. He may be smiling one moment, but the next minute he will suddenly shout and throw a fit,” said Ms Porchelvi, who works full-time as an administrative assistant at a logistics company.\n\n“I tried sending him to daycare centres before, but he used to cry when he was there. I have no choice but to keep him at home.”\n\nMs Porchelvi needs to ensure that her son takes his medicine every day, as well as an injection once every three weeks to regulate his mood.\n\nShe also has to keep a close eye on her younger sister, who suffers from dementia and lives alone.\n\n“I am sort of a caregiver to my sister too,” said Ms Porchelvi. She has no one and needs my help. Sometimes I have to remind her about certain things. Since she is also suffering from depression, she needs my moral support.”\n\nMs Porchelvi, who got divorced when her son was five years old, also has an older daughter who is married and living on her own.\n\n“I faced a lot of struggles after the divorce. I had no one. It was just my parents, and then my dad passed away about 10 years ago,” she said.\n\n“Janarthan was very close to him and he went into depression after my dad’s passing. He didn’t understand why his grandfather was suddenly not there. It took many years for us to make him understand.”\n\nWhile Ms Porchelvi could initially rely on her mother to take care of her son, that hasn’t been the case since her mother’s health deteriorated.\n\n“Anything can happen at any time to my mother. She is very weak and I can’t be relying on her every time to take care of him,” she said.\n\nThe Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds), a voluntary welfare organisation, has stepped in to support the family.\n\nMr Janarthan now gets weekly training from Minds’ home-based care services on basic skills such as solving puzzles as well as throwing and catching a ball.\n\nMinds will release a series of six modules on life plans, living arrangements, and support networks and services later this year. The modules are part of Minds’ beefed-up online portal on future care planning options for caregivers, called FutureReady.\n\nThis comes after Minds saw an uptick in inquiries from caregivers on making future care arrangements.\n\n“The conversations highlighted a growing concern among caregivers regarding future planning for their children with special needs,” said Ms Ong Lay Hoon, director of community-based support services at Minds.\n\n“They wanted more detailed information on the schemes and grants available, along with guidance on asset distribution to ensure their children’s financial security in their absence.”\n\nSome of Minds’ initiatives have helped Ms Porchelvi, who has also undergone caregiver training, alleviate her financial burden in taking care of her family.\n\nShe engaged a helper three months ago to care for her ailing mother and son while she is at work. She also took up side jobs like baking and selling murukku online.\n\nConcerned about her son’s future, she hopes to gradually take him out more and expose him to the world.\n\nBut she needs extra hands.\n\n“I wish there are more male volunteers who can help single mothers like me,” said Ms Porchelvi. “They can bring my son out and spend time with him.”\n\nMs Porchelvi with her son Janarthan.\n\nPHOTO: T PORCHELVI\n\n“I faced a lot of struggles after the divorce.

Santosh Kumar\n\nTo Kill A Tiger, set in a village in India’s Jharkhand, lost to 20 Days in Mariupol in the best documentary feature category at the 96th edition of the Academy Awards last Sunday.\n\nBut the 127-minute Nisha Pahuja film, which chronicles a father’s unwavering pursuit of justice for his daughter, made a mark: It drew broader attention to sexual assaults and the rampant epidemic of misogynistic violence in India.\n\nTending to the rice fields, Ranjit – the doting father to his daughter, the victim of a sexual assault in 2017 – shares a poignant revelation towards the end of the film: “I was once told, ‘You can’t kill a tiger by yourself’. But I replied, ‘I’ll show you how’. And so, I did.”\n\nThat sets up the narrative arc of the tale.\n\nForged over the course of eight years, the documentary, winner of over 20 awards at festivals around the world, highlights the pervasive nature of male violence against females ingrained in the fabric of Indian society.\n\nMost girls in India hide in shame after being victims of heinous crimes. But Kiran, a rape victim from Jharkhand, decided to unlearn the teachings of centuries of patriarchy and reveal her face in this documentary about the atrocious crime that was committed against her.\n\nOf course, Kiran is a pseudonym used in the film, and To Kill A Tiger is a documentary about the heroism of Kiran and her father. But the film is so much more than just that. It is a documentary about predators.\n\nIn a small village in Jharkhand, resides 13-year-old Kiran. On one fateful night, she attends the wedding of her father’s nephew. While the rest of the party returns home, Kiran is delayed.\n\nShe arrives home at 1.30am, stumbling and barely able to stand. She tells her father that she was dragged away by three men and mercilessly raped, one of them being the nephew himself.\n\nIn a close-knit community like a village, news spreads like wildfire. When the rest of the village finds out about the alleged incident, they come up with a “foolproof solution” – marry Kiran off to one of the rapists and let the others go free. Because this is the only way to maintain harmony in the village.\n\nKiran’s family, however, especially her father, vow to seek justice for his daughter.\n\nTo Kill A Tiger documentary focuses on the works of the Srijan Foundation, an organisation that works in the area, which helped Kiran’s father Ranjit fight for his daughter.\n\nWriter and director Pahuja, an Indian-born Canadian, told Boston-based publication WBUR: “I’ve been interested in exploring the issue of gender justice and violence against women in India for a number of years. It felt like this particular story could illuminate the why behind the headlines that continually come out of India.”\n\nInitially, Pahuja had planned to hide Kiran’s face in the movie, to protect her identity. But the now 18-year-old Kiran insisted otherwise. She refused to be shamed and stay hidden for something that was no fault of hers.\n\nThe documentary has bagged several awards, including the Best Documentary 2023 award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and the Best Film 2022 at Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).\n\nBollywood and Hollywood actress Priyanka Chopra, who joined American actress, screenwriter and producer Mindy Kaling and British actor and director Dev Patel as an executive producer ahead of To Kill A Tiger’s Netflix debut on March 10, said: “The film speaks not just to survivors, but their allies as well, men supporting women. It’s interesting to have a window into that and see how a father fights his entire community, the justice system, against what he’s told is the norm for his daughter’s rights.”\n\nPriyanka was born in Jharkhand – the same state where To Kill A Tiger was filmed. “That’s what a village in India looks like,” she said. “It’s very authentically shot.”\n\nThe actress saw the movie soon after its TIFF premiere, and remembers how Ranjit’s struggle moved her to tears for personal reasons.\n\n“I lost my father in 2013 and he was my biggest champion,” she said. “Ranjit and his quiet resolution – my dad was that kind of champion for me. There is something about having a dad that’s your champion. It’s a universal feeling.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“I lost my father in 2013 and he was my biggest champion.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe water crisis in Bengaluru, India’s Garden City, seems to be getting worse.\n\nAccording to media reports, despite the city administration’s intervention to stabilise inflated tanker water rates, there is still a shortage of water supply.\n\nKarnataka’s capital city is facing one of the worst water crises in recent years due to poor rainfall last year.\n\nThe primary water sources for Bengaluru are the Kaveri river and groundwater, but with the shortfall in rain in recent times, these sources have been pushed to their limits.\n\nBengaluru needs about 2,800 million litres of water daily. The current supply is half.\n\nFor more than two weeks, the rise in the city’s temperatures – between 30 deg C and 34 deg C – has contributed to the water shortage.\n\n“In the last 30 to 40 years, we have not seen such a drought,” said Deputy Chief Minister D.K.

The authorities have responded with fixed rates for supplying water to residential areas.\n\nHowever, many residents’ welfare associations are complaining that the price cap has not been effective, as the water suppliers are still charging exorbitant prices. And people in need of water are forced to pay what is asked.\n\nResidents have been complaining that they used to pay Rs800 for water tankers, but now the cost has shot up to Rs 2,000.\n\nAlso, getting water tankers is very difficult as they are booked well in advance.\n\nTo ease the people’s woes, the civic authorities have introduced treated water to replenish groundwater sources and bring the nearly 50 per cent dried up borewells back to life.\n\nThey also announced the construction of water plants in conjunction with the Indian Institute of Science, using innovative technologies near the restored lake beds.\n\nWhile the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board has set several rules – including a city-wide ban on washing cars and gardening with drinking water – resident, hospitality associations and education centres have also taken it upon themselves to play a part in saving water.\n\nCompanies are themselves scrambling to somehow manage the situation.

Any person, including Muslim migrants from any foreign country seeking to be an Indian citizen, can apply for the same under the existing laws,” the ministry said.\n\nIndian Muslims need not worry as CAA has not made any provision to impact their citizenship and has nothing to do with the present 180 million Indian Muslims, who have equal rights like their Hindu counterparts, the ministry said.\n\nProtests have erupted in several parts of the country against the decision to implement the CAA as some fear the law could be used to declare them illegal immigrants and take away their citizenship.\n\nThe government denies this and says the law is needed to help minorities facing persecution in Muslim-majority nations.\n\n“No Indian citizen would be asked to produce any document to prove citizenship”, the ministry said, adding that the Citizenship Act does not deal with the deportation of illegal immigrants.\n\nThe ministry explained that the law was needed to “customise the citizenship system and control illegal migrants”.\n\nThe Constitution of India grants the government the right to provide citizenship from a humanitarian perspective to refugees who face religious persecution in their countries.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aa1a84107f6f8ce9d5ddc579a56d74b7d94731f7261010fdcb1fc404c0a211fb?w=825", "alt_text": "Students protesting against the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act in Kolkata on March 12."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nInstead of saying or texting OMG, use the Singlish word “alamak” the next time you want to express shock or frustration.\n\nA report published in The Straits Times on March 8 revealed that an inaugural study by language-learning company Preply found that this Malay word is the most popular Singlish term here.\n\nWhat’s more, using it will earn you some points with Singaporeans.\n\nPreply’s language expert Sylvia Johnson explains: “Getting up to speed on the local slang is a big part of learning a language and fitting in with the locals. It demonstrates not just linguistic competence but also cultural sensitivity.”\n\nTry also to use words like “makan”, which means to eat in Malay, and common fillers such as “lah, lor, meh and leh”, typically used for emphasis, and as a suffix, in local speech.\n\nAmong the other top Singlish words in Preply’s findings were “paiseh”, which means embarrassed or shameful; “kaypoh”, meaning nosy; and “shiok”, for something enjoyable or delicious.\n\nAlamak was also in the spotlight after it was humorously used by pop star Taylor Swift’s dancer Kameron Saunders during a recent performance at the National Stadium.\n\nIt earned him thunderous applause from the appreciative audience.\n\nIt is not always common for slang words to become popular. For instance, while 66 per cent of the survey’s respondents were able to use alamak correctly in a sentence, only 35 per cent were able to do the same with “slay”.\n\nDespite not being used much by the older generations, slay, which means to do a job exceedingly well, is the most understood of the slang words adopted by Gen Z – a term that refers to those born in the late 1990s to around 2010.\n\nFor the record, Preply surveyed more than 1,500 Singaporeans aged between 16 and in their 50s.\n\nOf course, there are people who shun slang, and admittedly, it did take a long time for Singlish to be seen as reflective of Singapore’s multiculturalism, with its roots in the Malay, Tamil, Chinese and English languages.\n\nThe patois also achieved a certain degree of legitimacy with the inclusion of Singlish words in the Oxford English Dictionary. In 2016, this venerable lexicon added “aiyoh”, commonly used to express dismay, and “aiyah”, which could express derision or joy, among other Singlish words and phrases to its list.\n\nEven then, you’ll have to “wait long long” for Singlish to compete with the King’s English.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Bollywood movie Maidaan tells the story of Syed Abdul Rahim, a legendary football manager who deserves huge credit for the rise of Indian football in the late-1900s.\n\nStarring Ajay Devgn in the main role, the film’s trailer begins with his voice-over as he says: “We aren’t the largest country, neither the richest. Half the world doesn’t know us. Football can create our identity because the whole world plays football. So, India needs to focus on making a world-class team for the next 10 years.”\n\nRahim was the coach of the national team from 1950 to 1963. During that period, regarded as the “Golden Age of Indian Football”, the country secured Asian Games golds in 1951 and 1962.\n\nBorn on Aug 17, 1909, in Hyderabad, Rahim took a teaching job in his early days, before becoming a professional footballer. He played for local club Qamar and later Dutch Amateur League club HSV Hoek.\n\nIndia refused to compete in the 1950 FIFA World Cup, then known as the Jules Rimet trophy, because their players reportedly refused to wear boots.\n\nA year later, they became the best team in Asia by winning gold at the Asian Games. In the final, India edged out Iran 1-0 in front of a packed crowd in Delhi, with then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru present at the stadium.\n\nWhen Rahim kicked off his managerial career, most teams in the world were playing the 2-3-5 formation. The Indian mastermind introduced the 4-4-2 system, which was later popularised by Brazil in the 1958 and 1962 World Cups.\n\nUnder his guidance, India also secured fourth place in the 1956 Olympics.\n\nWhen India took the field for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta, Rahim had been diagnosed with cancer, and was told he had less than 10 months to live. His team beat South Korea 2-1 in the final to reclaim the gold.\n\nRahim breathed his last on June 11, 1963, at the age of 53.\n\nMaidan’s 2 min 43 sec trailer shows Rahim working to put India on the global football map. While the coach believes in his vision, he is not supported by the Indian Football Association leadership.\n\nThe story moves around how he forms the team and overcomes the challenges as he tries to take his team over the finish line.\n\nJoining Devgn are Priyamani, Gajraj Rao and Bengali actor Rudranil Ghosh in pivotal roles. Produced by Zee Studios, Boney Kapoor, Arunava Joy Sengupta and Akash Chawla, the film boasts a musical score by Oscar winner A.R.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe seeds of a private tennis ball cricket league was sowed during a talent hunt in Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, in 2021.\n\nEnthused by the talent on display, some eminent stakeholders of the game decided that the dwellers should be given an opportunity to play club cricket in Mumbai.\n\nAmol Kale, president of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), conceptualised a plan to take these cricketers from the street to the stadium, reported Forbes India.\n\nThe result is the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL), a 10-over tennis ball tournament, that started on March 6.\n\n“The idea for the league came about when we took the Dharavi boys into the mainstream. We decided to have a professional format for tennis ball cricket so that these players get an opportunity to play in stadiums as well as earn something out of it. The idea is to change the socio-economic structure of cricket,” said Kale.\n\nA first-of-its-kind initiative, the ISPL has six teams – Majhi Mumbai, Bangalore Strikers, Srinagar Ke Veer, Chennai Singhams, Falcon Risers Hyderabad and Tigers of Kolkata.\n\nIndian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar and Board of Control for Cricket in India treasurer Ashish Shelar are core committee members along with Kale, while former India all-rounder and coach Ravi Shastri serves as a mentor.\n\nAdding to the ISPL’s glam quotient are actors Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Hrithik Roshan, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor who are co-owners of the teams.\n\nISPL commissioner and MCA apex council member Suraj Samat told Forbes India: “There was a lot of fire in those children. But we realised there’s no opportunity for them if they do not cross the barrier and reach the mainstream. Amol Kale then decided that we should do something for their upliftment and find talent from the grassroots.”\n\nKale discussed his plan with Shelar and Tendulkar, who were both excited and worked together to turn the idea into reality.\n\n“There is immense talent out there… cricketers who have the aspiration to make it big and play for the country,” said Shelar, who played tennis ball cricket for his college and for his bar when he was practising law.\n\n“However, not everyone is lucky enough to get the right guidance and platform to realise their dreams.\n\n“These players have been displaying their cricketing skills on the streets. We thought, why can’t we build an ecosystem, help them hone their skills and get them to earn more. We want them to get recognition, fame and money.”\n\nMore than 200,000 players from across India applied to play in the tournament. There were only 96 player slots. Former India cricketers Pravin Amre and Jatin Paranjpe selected the players.\n\nThe bids for the six teams started at Rs10 lakh ($16,000) and ended at Rs1,165 crore ($200 million).\n\n“We liked the concept of street to stadium, and went ahead with it. It’s a good way of promoting players and giving them a platform to earn name and fame,” said co-owner of Majhi Mumbai Neeti Agrawal. “We are committed to the ISPL for 10 years and want to be associated with it all our life.”\n\nSaif, whose father Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi was a legendary India captain, said: “This is a wonderful initiative.

The beginning of cricket for everyone is with a tennis ball.”\n\nSony Pictures Networks bagged exclusive rights for the inaugural season of the 18-match tournament that is being played at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane, with the final scheduled for March 15.\n\nIt’s difficult for a private sporting league to make money in the initial years, but Kale said they are not thinking along those lines.\n\n“Profit is not the motive,” he said. “More than the financial model, the aim is to give maximum people an opportunity to play in stadiums.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“More than the financial model, the aim is to give maximum people an opportunity to play in stadiums.”\n\nAmol Kale, who conceptualised the blueprint for the Indian Street Premier League.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ad86c5186f70144c0a25bbc1a36b91f76167a684867892f7d67b619eb87179c6?w=825", "alt_text": "Para cricketer Amir Hussian Lone bowled the first delivery of the Indian Street Premier League, which started on March 6."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFor most foreign citizens of Indian origin, the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card is an easy mode to enter India at any time.\n\nThey do not have to spend time applying for a visa or queueing up to collect one.\n\n“It makes my trips to India smooth,” said a 46-year-old Singaporean-Indian OCI card holder. “It is like my own personal Indian passport; I clear Indian immigration easily whenever I want to go visit my parents and relatives.”\n\nCreated in 2005, the mini passport-like document, issued by the Government of India, allows foreign citizens of Indian origin or foreigners married to Indian citizens to enter India without a visa, and to reside, work and hold property, among other benefits.\n\nIndia created the OCI in 2005 under the Citizenship Act, 1955. OCIs have no voting rights.\n\nMore than 4.5 million people across the world are overseas citizens of India. India does not allow dual citizenship, but for long many have believed that the OCI status is effectively dual citizenship without political rights.\n\nOCI is actually a multi-purpose, multiple entry, lifelong visa for visiting India, and highly sought after by foreign citizens of Indian origin.\n\nThose eligible can apply for it online, and it usually takes about 40 days for the card to be issued by the Indian High Commission or Embassy. The fee for Singapore passport holders is $374.\n\nIn the past nine years, more than 100 foreign passport holders’ OCI status have been cancelled by the Indian government, according to data that India’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) shared with news website Article14.\n\nAccording to The Straits Times, since those figures were revealed, many more have been banned from travelling to India or have lost their OCI status.\n\nThe two recent cases include academic Ashok Swain, who had been teaching peace and conflict studies for 33 years in Sweden, and French correspondent Vanessa Dougnac, who had reported on South Asia for 23 years from India and received her OCI status as the spouse of an Indian citizen.\n\nIn both cases, it appears their OCI status were revoked for indulging in “anti-India activities” and “malicious work” that created a “biased negative perception” of India.\n\nThe Indian government can remove the OCI status of individuals if they “express disaffection towards the Constitution... or in the interest of the sovereignty of India, security of state or public interest”.\n\nIt has argued in recent years that the OCI status is not a right, but a privilege that can be revoked.\n\nIn general, people holding the card in Singapore are not worried that they will fall in the list. “Unless you have been vocal and critical about the policies of the Indian government and resorted to slandering them or the ruling political party, there is no cause to worry,” said a Singaporean-Indian OCI card-holder.\n\nThe MHA appears to have taken action against OCIs who have “defamed India” or spread “detrimental propaganda”. Most of these people are reportedly based in Europe and North America, especially Canada.\n\nIn September 2023, there were reports of the authorities planning to cancel the OCI status of a dozen people it accused of supporting a separate homeland for Sikhs.\n\nIf a person’s OCI card is revoked, he can enter India only after applying for a travel visa, which tends to be denied to those who are blacklisted.\n\nA group of Indian-origin people holding passports of different countries challenged the 2021 OCI amendment in India’s Supreme Court in February that year, arguing that it gave the executive too much power to revoke OCI status for vague reasons – and they were given no opportunity to contest.\n\nThe lead petitioner is Dr Radhika Thappeta, a doctor of internal medicine who works in Bengaluru and the United States. She said the petition was to question the lack of judicial process before the OCI status is revoked, and to make a constitutional case that overseas citizenship status should be seen as a dual citizenship.\n\nThe petition said the government’s arbitrary powers to revoke the OCI status subjects overseas citizens “to a constant state of hardship, fear and uncertainty”, and has “a chilling effect on OCIs who... cannot express peaceful dissent against the state” or public grievances “out of fear that their overseas citizenship may be cancelled”.\n\nThe petition awaits a final verdict.\n\nAcademic Ashok Swain managed to win a court case against the cancellation of his permanent residency in India in 2023. But within two weeks, the Indian Embassy in Stockholm cancelled it again over his posts on social media criticising some Indian policies. x\n\nPHOTO: COURTESY OF ASHOK SWAIN\n\nFrench journalist Vanessa Dougnac, who is married to an Indian citizen, waiting for her flight to Paris on Feb 16.

Swift is performing six shows at the National Stadium from March 2 to 9.\n\nThe fan frenzy was on full display, and it encompassed people of all genders, ages and races. One couldn’t help but notice the preponderance of Indians among the crowd – not just the teenage girls, but their accompanying mothers, boyfriends, and for girls under the age of 12, their fathers as well.\n\nIt’s no secret that Swift is a formidable force in the music industry, topping charts, winning Grammys, performing at sold-out concerts. But the eye-opening numbers her Eras Tour concert movie notched in India last November showed just how strong her fan base is there as well.\n\nAs many as 85,000 tickets were sold in advance for the opening weekend, and the movie earned around Rs5 crore ($810,000) in the first two days alone.\n\nSo how and when did Swift become such a phenomenon in India? Why does the Indian Gen Z connect with a musician from the United States, especially when Indian pop culture – via Bollywood – already produces so much on its end?\n\nFor Archana Chopra, 35, who has been a Swiftie since 2008, Swift’s music details the “struggle of every young girl out there”.\n\nShe said: “Her songs speak to us. It’s like confessional songwriting that relates to so many different people. It’s not just love songs, but about growing up, or standing up to bullying or accepting yourself.”\n\nMs Archana, who attended the March 4 concert with her two younger sisters, flew in from Mumbai the same day after procuring tickets from scalpers at the 11th hour.\n\n“We don’t know if she’s coming to India. First we heard ‘no’, now it’s a ‘maybe’, but since we’ve travelled (to Singapore) before, we decided not to wait and see and just catch her in action here.”\n\nMs Roshini Ahuja, 42, who became a fan of Swift through her daughter, said what she liked most about Swift was the image she portrays.\n\n“Her songs are very catchy of course, and she’s always so beautiful and glamorous, but she does everything without being overly sexual in her image or music. Today, especially, you can’t say that about too many pop stars,” said Ms Roshini, an Indian expat here who works in insurance.\n\n“Also, Indians love seeing good storytelling from our artistes. And that’s what Taylor Swift does well. She could write a song from a page of her diary, and it’ll resonate with someone.”\n\nTouted as arguably the biggest star in the world right now, Swift broke records last year when her Eras Tour became the first concert tour to hit US$1 billion ($1.35 billion) in gross revenue.\n\nShe also became the first entertainer to be named Time Person Of The Year last December, an accolade not even Elvis Presley of The Beatles can lay claim to.\n\nSwift’s diverse and experimental style of music has also helped her garner more fans than other artistes who stick to one genre, said Kesh Agarwal, 29, who attended the concert with his girlfriend and her mother. The trio flew in from Australia where they reside.\n\n“But whether she’s singing country or pop or folk, it’s always catchy and meaningful in some way. I’m not a big fan per se, but I do appreciate her music.”\n\nIf Indian Swifties ever doubted that a Swift concert in India would draw a big crowd, that surely must have been dispelled this past week.\n\nTaylor Swift undeniably rules millions of Indian hearts as well.\n\n“Indians love seeing good storytelling from our artistes. And that is what Taylor Swift does well. She could write a song from a page of her diary, and it’ll resonate with someone.”\n\nMs Roshini Ahuja, who attended the Taylor Swift concert in Singapore on March 4.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/18f472ec286baa6708469b50aa11b05035f40b3715e8d7f8a831931152a5ce4c?w=825", "alt_text": "A group of friends from Raffles Institution before catching Taylor Swift in concert at the National Stadium on March 4."}]}

Dhoni, Dhwani Prakas was just 15 when she debuted for Singapore in the 2022 Saudari Cup, a T20I cricket series with Malaysia.\n\nShe had been talent-spotted just three months earlier by national women’s team coach Chamal De Silva while accompanying her 11-year-old brother Dhruv for his U-12 cricket training.\n\nChamal described to Dhwani’s parents that “she had a natural wicketkeeping technique” and encouraged them to enlist her for training at the Singapore National Cricket Academy (SNCA), paving the way for her to represent Singapore at the international level.\n\nLike Dhwani, there is plenty of cricketing talent among women in Singapore, and the Singapore Cricket Association (SCA) is on a mission to unearth it.\n\nThe Singapore Women’s Cricket Pathway was established as part of the SCA Vision 2025 Multi-year Strategic Plan to provide a seamless route into the national team for women cricketers through high-performance coaching.\n\nBeginning with the SNCA, which recruits players as young as seven, girls can progress to the National Development Squad and later the National Elite Squad. From the Elites, a smaller squad is selected to represent Singapore in tournaments. Girls are eligible for national squads at age 13 and T20 internationals at age 15. Further details are available at singaporecricket.org.\n\nDhwani’s mother Vidhya, 38, is now an integral part of this pathway.\n\nHaving become an ActiveSG-certified coach at the SNCA in March last year, she has also been serving as the national women’s team manager since January this year.\n\nSeeing her daughter’s growth reminds Vidhya of how far women’s cricket has come. She said: “When I played cricket in school in India, there were no women’s tournaments, and I was questioned how I could match up to the boys. I eventually stopped playing.”\n\nSingapore’s growing reputation in international women’s leagues provides extra motivation for the women cricketers here.\n\nKnown as the Sunbirds, the national women’s cricket team made its T20I debut in the 2018 Saudari Cup against Malaysia, winning two matches out of a six-match series. It recorded its first T20I series win on Feb 10, 2023.\n\nChamal looks back with pride: “At the ACC Women’s T20 Championship 2022, right after the Covid-19 break, a number of our 11 players were 15 years old, and we were playing Oman who had all fully contracted players. My world cup winning mentor was their coach. Yet, our girls beat them.”\n\nHe added: “We have come quite far since 2019 when we were ranked 46 out of 46 and had just 15 girls to today, having more than 370 active girls playing cricket, a 10-team Sunbirds league, development squads, four-days-a-week training and a growing academy.”\n\nSingapore still rank 46 out of 66 teams. In comparison, Thailand are 12th, Indonesia 20th, Malaysia 24th, Myanmar 40th and Japan 50th.\n\nChamal also oversees the SNCA Build a Healthy Future Cricket Scholarship that gives young talents a professionally designed pathway to represent Singapore. Scholarship recipients receive SCA-sponsored coaching worth $2,500 a year.\n\nHe notes that the SNCA is widening its talent search to orphanages, special needs schools and underprivileged families. It is also supplying more coaches to mainstream schools.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that certain challenges persist.\n\n“Our players are all part-timers,” he said. “Their full-time jobs or studies give them limited leave. Further, due to their work schedule, we train at night after 7pm whereas matches are in the day, so players have to adjust.”\n\nHis dream is to see his players go to the World Cup. “Our team is young and has plenty of match winners. With training, they can improve by 60 to 70 per cent.”\n\nDhwani (left) and Vidhya Prakas.\n\nPhoto: Vidhya Prakas\n\n“When I played cricket in school in India, there were no women’s tournament, and I was questioned how I could match up to the boys.

She wrapped up the nearly three-hour concert with peppy dance numbers.\n\n“The performance was mind-blowing,” said Ms Anu Samtani, owner of the events and entertainment company Action Replay. “She truly captured the audience’s attention with her versatility and scintillating rendition.\n\n“Her show was curated very well and had a good blend of songs that she sang impeccably.”\n\nSingapore company Advaita Events, which managed the show along with two Australia-based outfits, made it a captivating experience with LED displays, sound design and special effects.\n\n“It was part of Shreya’s All Hearts Tour, which will see her perform in Australia, Singapore, Dubai, Doha, United Kingdom, United States, Canada and other venues,” said Ms Jinny Nevatia, Advaita’s owner.\n\n“We wanted her fans in Singapore to have a great experience, and we brought in the best back-up musicians and light and sound technicians.\n\n“In a week when Taylor Swift was performing in Singapore, India’s top female singer too was a big draw.”\n\nTrained vocalist Ria Dev said that “Shreya navigated through a diverse range of musical genres effortlessly, transitioning from soft, melodious tunes to lovely foot-tappers, all in multiple languages”.\n\nShe added: “The synergy between Shreya and her accompanying musicians was impeccable.”\n\nFormer banker Yamini Mathur was impressed with Shreya’s “amazing energy”.

And then head to work on Monday morning. Obviously, it wasn’t easy.”\n\nSingapore’s cricket players will not have to endure such arduous trips any longer, since it was announced last month that a dedicated training facility for cricket will be built in West Coast by mid-2024.\n\nThe 4.7ha site at West Coast Road will have a pitch, nets, gym and sheltered training area.\n\nThe men’s and women’s national teams will begin training there by the third quarter of this year, said Rezza, 31, who spoke to tabla! on the sidelines of a Team Singapore reception at the Istana on Feb 29.\n\nMore than 700 Team Singapore athletes, coaches and officials were present at the reception, hosted by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. It was organised to celebrate the contributions and achievements of the athletes in 2023.\n\nThe lack of a proper training pitch for the cricketers came to the fore during the Cambodia SEA Games in May last year. After winning the men’s Sixes title, the players raised concerns about the preparations for the Games, pointing to the lack of a proper training venue.\n\nAt the time, the senior side trained up to three times a week at the Singapore Indian Association ground in Balestier Road, which they said was poorly maintained and small.\n\nTraining has been held there since 2016, after the Singapore Cricket Association had to vacate the Kallang Cricket Field as the lease was not renewed.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Asian Games last year, the team also trained in Johor.\n\nRezza, who captained the SEA Games team to one gold and two bronze medals in Cambodia last year, described the new facility as a much-needed boost for Singapore cricket.\n\nHe also hopes the venue will be ready in time to possibly host the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League, which serves as a qualifier for the World Cup.\n\nSingapore will face Qatar, Kuwait, Denmark and Italy in their group.\n\n“It’s not been decided who will host the matches, and so I hope that the new facility will be ready in time to do so,” Rezza said.\n\n“We’re all excited about it.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe controversy over the cancellation of the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status of more than 100 people involves several legal and political issues. These deserve to be aired in the public interest.\n\nWhat is disturbing is that the debate has indirectly invoked the idea that the OCI scheme is a form of dual citizenship. It is not. Had it been so, holding an OCI card would have been illegal in many countries, including Singapore, which disallows dual (or multiple) citizenship.\n\nIndeed, it would have been astonishing for India to operate the OCI scheme since it, too, prohibits dual citizenship, according to its Constitution.\n\nThese realities are in danger of being obscured in the coverage of the controversy. In one report, an OCI housewife in her 50s, who lives with her family in Bengaluru, said that, when the OCI scheme was introduced, she had understood it as “dual citizenship without voting rights”. But she now believes that “I am simply a foreigner with a long-term visa”.\n\nYes. That is exactly what she is. Whether an OCI lives abroad or resides in India, he or she is a foreigner for whom the OCI card is a life-long visa.\n\nThe fact that it is a visa proves it is not a form of dual citizenship. No citizen of India needs a visa to visit or remain in India (any more than a Singaporean needs a visa to visit or remain here).\n\nMatters are complicated somewhat by a 2021 petition filed in India’s Supreme Court which, according to a report, “argues that the government has long said that OCI status is effectively dual citizenship without political rights”.\n\nYet, the website of India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) states: “OCI is not to be misconstrued as ‘dual citizenship’. It does not confer political rights. The registered overseas citizens of India shall not be entitled to the rights conferred on a citizen of India under article 16 of the Constitution with regard to equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.”\n\nThe OCI scheme came into effect in 2005, expanding the benefits under the earlier Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) scheme, including the important provision that OCI cardholders could stay in India indefinitely.\n\nThe PIO scheme itself had strived to give its beneficiaries a degree of parity within India with the rights enjoyed by Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). An NRI is a citizen of India who lives abroad.\n\nThe evolution of official thinking about those of Indian origin living outside India – from NRIs to PIOs to OCIs – demonstrates that India cares about Indians abroad. However, this does not change the fact that there are Indian citizens and non-Indian citizens.\n\nThe term “overseas citizen of India” itself is a misnomer. Overseas, underwater, sky-borne or earth-thrown, living in palatial bungalows or building them for others, thriving in peace or distraught in war, there are only two kinds of Indians in this world: citizens and non-citizens. An OCI card does not make a non-Indian citizen a vicarious Indian citizen.\n\nThese lines of national demarcation are important in an age when ancestry and ethnicity are impinging on national loyalties. I am not insinuating of course that India wishes to create a reserve army of ethnic supporters outside its borders, or that Indians settled abroad would join that imaginary force through the “dual citizenship” fiction attributed to the OCI scheme.\n\nIn countries like Singapore, citizenship means unalloyed loyalty to Singapore and only Singapore. Ethnicity and ancestry are facts of life, but there are higher facts of life, and no reality is higher for a citizen than ultimate loyalty to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the person’s country.\n\nI hope that the controversy over the withdrawal of OCI cards passes without impugning the loyalty of Indians who have chosen to make some other country in the world home.\n\nAsad Latif is an editorial writer for The Straits Times.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/india/ocis-are-not-dual-citizens?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThere was a time when the dream of many Indian parents was for their children to grow up and become a doctor, lawyer or engineer.\n\nHowever, the growing preference for their child to don the coveted white coat and stethoscope has put the two other professions in the shade.\n\nSadly, my siblings and I failed to measure up. One brother worked as a teacher, another as a marketing manager and I went into communications. My sister came closest – she became a nurse.\n\nThe next generation, however, delivered. Among our six children, there are four doctors. The only exceptions are my two children, who are teachers.\n\nOkay, so I failed as a parent. Now, let’s get back on track.\n\nThe task of steering your children into the medical profession is made easier by the great respect for doctors from the Indian community.\n\nThis respect extends also to the doctors’ families, who are often seen as having achieved a certain level of status via their association with the medical profession.\n\nThis might explain why Indian parents pressure their children to qualify for medical school. Several Indian doctors I know readily admitted that their parents had forced them to become doctors. Any other profession would be considered a failure, they added.\n\nAnother said that her parents were both doctors, and she was “duty-bound” to continue the family’s legacy whether she liked it or not. She actually did not like it, and duly got rid of her white coat and stethoscope immediately after marriage.\n\nOne general practitioner was extremely candid. He said he was neither tall nor handsome, so if he wanted a good-looking wife, he had to become a doctor.\n\nHaving met his spouse, I would say he has succeeded admirably.\n\nParents also have bragging rights since all physicians must attain high test scores. It is undeniable proof of their great parenting skills.\n\nDoctors also enjoy good financial security, so you could consider Indian parents as “low-risk investors”.\n\nSelecting a “non-risky” career for their children bodes better than letting them pick a job they would love but might leave them in the lurch.\n\nSo, from the Indian perspective, the medical profession has everything going for it.

She was rushed to hospital where doctors said she had suffered a stroke.\n\nA stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. If blood flow is cut off for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get nutrients and oxygen. The death of brain cells can  cause lasting damage.\n\nMs Suja, who was born and raised in Tamil Nadu and moved to Singapore with her family in 2018, was just 44 years old at the time. She said she couldn’t contain her disbelief as she lay bedridden soon after.\n\n“Only a week before, I had a full-body checkup. I did not have a history of either blood pressure or cholesterol. No existing medical issues surfaced then,” she said.\n\nAfter using a wheelchair for four months, Ms Suja now walks with the aid of a set of ankle foot orthoses and sometimes a crutch.\n\nShe has, however, lost the use of her left hand.\n\nA similar fate befell 69-year-old Kogilam Hannah who at the age of 31, was pregnant for the first time.\n\nThe then admin assistant suffered a stroke following complications from the pregnancy, which resulted in a miscarriage.\n\n“A blood vessel ruptured, and I was in a coma for ten days,” she said.\n\nTill today, she needs a wheelchair to move around.\n\nWhat truly hurt, she said, was that she couldn’t risk getting pregnant again.\n\nWhen she suggested trying for a child again, her husband refused, saying that it could endanger her life. “He said that if we feel like we need a child, we could always adopt.”\n\nBoth women cite their husbands as pivotal pillars of support throughout their ordeal – and the painful and long recovery process.\n\nMs Hannah, a Singaporean who grew up in Naval Base estate, met her husband, an engineer from Kerala, in 1982.\n\n“My friends had warned me that a husband from India would be very conservative, even oppressive. But he turned out to be nothing like that,” she said.\n\nMs Suja also counts on her 26-year-old daughter for emotional and physical support.\n\n“I have been in and out of depression several times; it is only through will power that I remind myself to live life the best way I can,” she said.\n\nAside from their family members, the two women’s support system comprises a network of medical professionals from the Singapore National Stroke Associations (SNSA), who advise stroke patients on their exercise and diet.\n\nDr Shamala Thilarajah, a principal physiotherapist at Singapore General Hospital and a clinical therapist for stroke and neurological rehabilitation, told Tabla! that many stroke survivors feel they have lost their independence after a stroke attack, and believe that “their life is over”.\n\nAccording to the Singapore Stroke Registry’s most recent annual report in 2021, the number of stroke episodes increased from 6,143 in 2011 to 9,680 in 2021. The median age at onset of stroke increased slightly from 68.0 years in 2011 to 69.8 years in 2021.\n\nDr Shamala pointed out that around one-third of patients experience anxiety or depression.\n\n“There are many who are just going through life trying to build their resilience after they have had a stroke. They may not be formally diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and they may not need medications, but what they need is support, perhaps some level of counselling,” she said.\n\nTo that end, stroke survivors can turn to the SNSA’s befriending programme.\n\n“Many of our patients have benefited from the befriending programme, where we pair a stroke survivor with another. I think it’s important that you talk to somebody who’s gone through a similar experience, so you can share,” Dr Shamala said.\n\n“I have been in and out of depression several times; it is only through will power that I remind myself to live life the best way I can.”\n\nSuja Padmanabhan, who suffered a stroke at age 44 while exercising.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/65a013220327898fdeadaa0b919d7d5bb94b32149556c22f54292b223f737299?w=825", "alt_text": "Stroke patients Suja Padmanabhan (right) and Kogilam Hannah."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Malayalam film Manjummel Boys has had such an impact on audiences in Tamil Nadu since its release on Feb 22 that it has caught the attention of Indian Premier League champions Chennai Super Kings.\n\nThe hugely popular cricket franchise, which has fans all over the country, has chosen to honour the film by playing on the title and releasing a poster called “Manjal Boys” – which refers to its team colour yellow.\n\nInspired by a real-life incident involving youngsters from Kerala navigating the treacherous Guna caves in Kodaikanal, the film has captivated audiences with its thrilling survival narrative.\n\nIn a remarkable feat, it has amassed more than Rs100 crores ($16 million) in just 12 days, solidifying its status as a blockbuster.\n\nManjummel Boys is also the first Malayalam film that has got more than 1,200 screenings in a day across theatres in India.\n\nA big reason why the film, directed by Chidambaram, is performing well across India is the melodic refrain and clever cinematic technique it has adopted: The movie has used the song “Kanmani anbodu kadhalan” from the 1991 Kamal Haasan film Gunaa as a key narrative device.\n\nSung by Kamal Haasan and S.

Today’s youth – many of whom weren’t born or were too young to even see the film – are celebrating Manjummel Boys’ tribute to the film and want to see the original.\n\n“Now, with youth in Tamil Nadu more aware of world cinema, they can appreciate Gunaa better.”\n\nThe demand for the re-release of Gunaa, directed by Santhana Bharathi, one of Kamal’s closest friends, is growing louder and louder on social media.\n\nAfter all, if there was no Kamal, there would be no Gunaa, and if there was no Gunaa, there would no Guna caves.

Santosh Kumar\n\nBritish Influencer and author Jay Shetty is under scrutiny after allegations that he lied about his life story and plagiarised social media posts.\n\nA report by The Guardian said that Mr Shetty, who officiated actors Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s marriage in 2022, falsely claimed to have spent three years in a temple in India, reported NDTV.\n\nMr Shetty runs a meditation start-up valued at US$2 billion ($2.68 billion). He is the author of the bestselling book Think Like A Monk: Train Your Mind For Peace And Purpose Every Day and has achieved much success in the wellness industry.\n\nHis official website said that, during his school years, he spent vacations living with monks in India, immersing himself in their wisdom and teachings.\n\nHowever, The Guardian report claims that the 36-year-old falsely claimed to have spent three years in a temple in India.\n\nQuestioning the veracity of Mr Shetty’s story, the report said: “People close to Shetty have questioned whether his conversion to a life of monkhood was quite so dramatic. Much of Shetty’s spiritual education took place not in India but in Watford, an orbital town outside north-west London, they say.”\n\nThe British daily also questioned Mr Shetty’s academic qualifications, pointing out discrepancies in his resume, including a degree from a business school that does not offer the claimed course.\n\nThe report said: “Shetty is hardly the first self-help guru to embellish his spiritual credentials to amass followers, but he demands huge sums of money for his guidance. Shetty has used his spiritual authority to launch a number of subscription and education services, including the life-coaching school, which charges US$7,400 a term for “Postgraduate Diploma (Level 7) qualifications” – equivalent to a master’s degree.”\n\nFollowing the report, Mr Shetty has reportedly directed his team to attribute content properly, delete a number of posts and hire a crisis PR firm.\n\nPeople who know Mr Shetty are disputing his claim of spending an extended time in India as a monk, the report said.\n\nAccording to Mr Shetty’s travel blog at the time, he considered “Bhaktivedanta Manor” as his main ashram.\n\nIn a 2011 post, he mentioned returning from “almost four months in India” before engaging in activities at London’s City University and “distributing flyers and books on the streets all over the UK and enjoying festivals”.\n\nHowever, some of his former associates said he stayed primarily at an estate near London called Bhaktivedanta Manor, rather than in Mumbai.\n\nWhile Mr Shetty’s legal team maintains he spent only a few months at Bhaktivedanta Manor before moving to India, others disagree, The Guardian reported.\n\nSocial media reactions to the accusations against Mr Shetty have been mixed. Some claim they were already suspicious of him being a “fraud”, while others were “disheartened” by the news.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c3ad8db3f368b1af47bba55909a0debb3be0183983e176c5dca401bc4f8fe69e?w=825", "alt_text": "Author Jay Shetty"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRihanna made a comeback on stage, even if it was just for one night.\n\nThe 36-year-old singer performed her first full live show in almost eight years – not counting her 15-minute slot at the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show and her Academy Award performance the same year – at the pre-wedding party of Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Indian multi-billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and his soon-to-be wife Radhika Merchant last weekend.\n\nShe regaled the 1,200-plus guests – including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump and several Bollywood stars – on a stage in Jamnagar, Gujarat, delivering a concert-length 19-song set, including hits such as her career-launching Umbrella and the No. 1 hits Diamonds and Work, NME reported.\n\nDressed in a flowing fluorescent green bodycon ensemble accentuated with a shimmering gown, Rihanna performed barefoot – an homage to the Indian culture – with her attire blending seamlessly with the opulent setting.\n\nFilm celebrities including Shah Rukh Khan, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Shreya Ghoshal and Shiamak Davar grooved to her tunes.\n\nHowever, despite bagging a whopping fee for her appearance, she was slammed by netizens after many opined that she put in “bare minimum effort” once videos of the performance went viral.\n\nMany called her act “lazy”, “lacklustre” and “boring”.\n\nThe pop star’s performance, which reportedly came with a hefty price tag – double that of Beyonce’s fee for a similar event a few years ago –, has ignited debate and disappointment among fans.\n\nThere’s been rampant speculation on how much she earned for her performance. Sources told India Today that her performance fee could have been somewhere between US$8 million ($10.7 million) and US$9 million.\n\nThe Daily Mail estimated a starting price of about US$6 million for the gig.\n\n“Rihanna was paid twice more than Beyonce to perform in India. Went home with a fat cheque and business deal after her lazy performance. There’s something about this woman we need to study,” said an X user.\n\nThe pop superstar was declared a billionaire and “richest female musician” by Forbes in 2021, causing one critic to call the Jamnagar show “charity work”.\n\n“I’ve always said she’s an incredibly lazy performer. She never took the time to improve her performances,” one person remarked on social media.\n\nAnother agreed: “Rihanna has always been dry and lacklustre, I don’t know why people are surprised.”\n\nSome fans defended Rihanna, saying that the singer normally gives low-energy performances.\n\nFreelance writer Ashley Reese wrote: “She has always performed like this live lol.”\n\nOther Rihanna defenders said fans should be more sympathetic to the singer because this is her first performance after two pregnancies.\n\nAll the same, Rihanna appeared unfazed by the commotion as she broke her silence on Instagram by promoting a range of underwear from her brand Fenty’s latest lingerie collection.\n\nThe three-day Ambani bash, which ended on Monday, was wildly extravagant, even by the standards of Indian weddings.\n\nThe elder Ambani, the chairman of the Fortune 500 company Reliance Industries, has an estimated net worth of US$113 billion. And, from the drone show, decor, flowers and festivities, it is clear that the family spared no expense: About US$120 million, the Daily Mail claimed, citing unnamed sources.\n\nAll eyes are now on the wedding, which is due in Mumbai in July.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\n“Rihanna was paid twice more than Beyonce to perform in India.

Later, five more men were arrested.\n\nAnother police official said more suspects have been detained and are being interrogated.\n\nThe incident has triggered a major public reaction in India, with the attack condemned by leaders across the political spectrum.\n\nBefore they left the country, the couple were given Rs1 million ($16,150) in compensation, and police released an image of the husband posing for a photo while receiving the cheque. The photo itself has provoked more outrage online.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Ms Anjula Murmu, a social worker in Dumka who supported the victims, said: “The woman fought her perpetrators strongly, but she was overpowered by the men, who repeatedly raped her for close to three hours. She was emotionally shattered but not broken. To express her visible trauma is beyond words.”\n\nThe couple entered India at the Pakistan border in Amritsar in mid-July and had been travelling across the country for the past six months, Ms Murmu said.\n\nThey are travel bloggers with a following of more than 600,000 on Instagram, and had pitched a tent for the night on March 1 amid the scenic countryside, some 400km from Jharkhand’s capital Ranchi.\n\n“Their tent began shaking and they heard voices at around 7.30pm when the victim’s male partner began recording a video out of caution,” she said.\n\n“He said ‘hello’ and those outside responded with hello... they appeared to be visibly drunk,” said Ms Murmu, who said she had seen the video recording.\n\nThe group left but returned with more men and began attacking the tent.\n\n“The moment (the couple) came out, they were attacked, with some of them restraining the man while the others went for the woman, who tried to get a knife out from her shoes and even hid in the dark to save herself,” Ms Murmu said.\n\nStruggling to fight back tears with their faces covered with bruises, the couple released a video on their Instagram handle saying they were beaten up by seven men who held knives against their throats and raped the woman while restraining her male partner.\n\n“Seven men raped me. They have beaten us and robbed us, although not many things (were taken) because what they wanted was to rape me,” she said in Spanish.\n\n“My face looks like this, but it’s not what hurts me the most. I thought we were going to die. Thank God we are alive.”\n\nThe woman on Tuesday said that she has no complaints against the people of India as she has safely travelled around 20,000km across the country.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before leaving for Nepal via Bihar along with her husband on their motorcycles, she said she would continue her world tour.\n\n“People of India are nice. I don’t blame the people, but I blame the criminals. People of India have treated me very well, and were very kind to me,” she said.\n\n“We chose the place for the night stay because it was calm and beautiful. We thought it would be okay if we lived there alone.”\n\nSinger Chinmayi Sripaada said that all Indians should be “ashamed” by the incident. “If all Indians can be proud when ‘few’ Indians win an Olympic medal, all Indians can also be ashamed when ‘few’ men rape,” she said on X.\n\n“My face looks like this, but it’s not what hurts me the most.

Santosh Kumar\n\nA 30-year-old man from Hyderabad, who was allegedly forced to join the Russian Army after falling prey to a job fraud, was killed in the country’s ongoing war with Ukraine, Indian officials said on Wednesday.\n\nThe family of the man, identified as Mohammed Asfan, reached out to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi to seek assistance in bringing him back from Russia.\n\nHowever, when Mr Owaisi contacted the Indian embassy in Moscow, officials confirmed that Asfan had died.\n\nReacting to the incident, the Indian embassy in Moscow took to X and said that authorities are in touch with Asfan’s family to send his remains back to India.\n\n“We have learnt about the tragic death of an Indian national Shri Mohammed Asfan. We are in touch with the family and Russian authorities. Mission will make efforts to send his mortal remains to India,” it wrote.\n\nMr Asfan, along with several others, was allegedly duped by an agent in Dubai who recruited them to work  as “helpers” in Russian government offices.\n\nHe along with two other men from Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir reached Russia in November last year. Mr Asfan last spoke with his family on Dec 31.\n\nAccording to his family, Mr Asfan used to work in a cloth showroom in Hyderabad. He paid Rs300,000 ($4,845) to the Dubai agent, who promised him a “high-paying job” in Russia.\n\nAfter he reached Moscow, he was made to sign a document which was in Russian.\n\nMr Afsan realised later that he was recruited as a “helper” in the Russian army, Asfan’s brother Imran told news agency ANI.\n\nThe recent fatality comes weeks after a 23-year-old Indian man from Gujarat, who was working as a “helper” with the Russian Army, died in Russia.\n\nThe man, identified as Mr Hamil Mangukiya from Surat, had applied for a job in Russia through an online advertisement.

Santosh Kumar\n\nPlaying a friendly hockey match every time he visits Singapore is normal for former national stalwart Nantha Kumar.\n\nBut on Feb 23, when he wielded his stick at the Singapore Indian Association (SGIA), it was for a special cause.\n\nThe 67-year-old, who leads a happily-retired life in Melbourne these days, was on the field to commemorate the deaths of his brother Selva Kumar and three cousins – Kesava Moorthy, K.S. Nathan and M. Paramantham – who were all respected hockey players.\n\n“The team I played for, Family United, is unique,” said Nantha. “It is made up of my cousins and nephews. We are about 15 and have been playing as Family United since 1978.”\n\nThe team beat an SGIA selection 1-0 in a match that consisted of three 15-minute periods.\n\nBut the scoreline was not important to Nantha.\n\nThe gathering of family members and friends to keep hockey alive at the SGIA ground was the highlight.\n\n“At one time in the 1970s, we 11 cousins, who stayed in one house on Tessensohn Road, used to jump over our backyard fence and play hockey whenever possible at either Singapore Chinese Recreation Club, Indian Association or Ceylon Sports Club,” he said.\n\n“No one stopped us and we could indulge in our passion freely. But now other sports have taken over and hockey games are rare at these clubs.”\n\nInterestingly, six of the cousins – Nantha, M. Neethiananthan, Ashok Kumar, Selva, M. Jeevananthan and Nathan – donned the national colours.\n\nInside-left Nantha and centre-half Jeeva were members of the 1973 SEAP Games gold-medal winning team, the first and only time Singapore won the hockey regional gold. Nantha was then 17 and Jeeva 16.\n\n“Hockey came naturally to us,” said Nantha. “Our fathers – Kanagasabai, Thanigasalam, Mohanavelu and Kalimuthu – never played the sport. We all stayed in one house, kampong style. We were united, our spirits were high, and we all wanted to excel in the sport.”\n\nFormer national hockey player and coach Harbhajan Singh Loomba said he has always been amazed by the hockey skills shown by the cousins.\n\n“I have seen all of them play at the Balestier grounds,” said the 86-year-old, who used to stay in Race Course Road in those days. “I coached them and also taught maths and physical eduction to three of them at Whitley Secondary.\n\n“They were all good players, and it was wonderful to see them play together as Family United.”\n\nWith the passing of some of the old guard, these days, the team’s numbers are filled by their nephews.\n\nOne of the nephews, engineer Kuhan Rajendran, said that hockey has brought the family together.\n\n“Sports has that ability,” said the 38-year-old. “I have always admired my uncles because some of them have brought glory to the nation.”\n\nOn Feb 23, after the evening match, nearly 40 members of the family gathered along with about 30 friends to celebrate the lives of the four who departed. There were speeches after dinner, and medals and trophies were distributed.\n\n“It is rare to see a family come together like this,” said business consultant Rajan Menon, 68, who has been Nantha’s friend since 1968. “The camaraderie and friendship are high during such occasions. It’s a good way to keep the family and community spirit going.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/26d9256bdc19fceb8baffaa0c3181dc900761bf5c106c54c1bc0e329e1eba213?w=825", "alt_text": "Members of Family United who played on Feb 23."}]}

But there are still five people queueing for their “breakfast” orders.\n\n“This is the low period; my rush hour is before 10am,” Suren, 37, says.\n\nHe notices me watching him add ingredients to the thosai, and remarks: “Nothing much to it, bro. Just need to add a bit of love, that’s all.”\n\nThe friendly and tall (1.82m) Suren is of a rare breed – a young Singaporean hawker who took the reins of a thosai stall from his mother, Madam Letchmi, who started the business in 1992.\n\nIt wasn’t even at his mother’s urging. In fact, Suren had begun his own business – selling similar food items at Simpang Bedok a little over a decade ago – right after he completed his national service (NS).\n\nIn 2020, after moving his business from place to place, Suren felt his mum needed a break, and took over Heaven’s.\n\n“When my mum handed me the keys, that same evening the circuit breaker was announced. We could only laugh,” he recalls.\n\n“So I had to pivot – that was a word I didn’t know until that point. I got ideas from friends who ran bars and other F&B (establishments). For example, I had friends who were driving Grab during that period, and so I got them to deliver the food islandwide for a flat fee of $10. In the end, we made it work.”\n\nInitially, after graduating from poly, Suren aimed to further his studies at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. He needed an A level certificate for admission, so he sat for his exams while serving NS and passed.\n\nBut by the time he was done with his two-year military stint, he decided the F&B scene was his true calling.\n\n“My siblings and I used to help my mum at the stall when we were younger, but they never really showed an interest in the trade. I liked it, and I helped my mum with the cooking,” Suren says.\n\n“After NS, I had the opportunity to start a business at Simpang Bedok. I asked my mum about it and she said ‘just try – if it doesn’t work out, you can always go back to your studies’.\n\n“I have never thought about studying since then.”\n\nThough business in Bedok was “good” for Suren, the food court shut after two years. He then moved his business around for a bit – by the time he was 29, he worked at five different outlets, including Changi Airport.\n\nAssisting him at Heaven’s are his cousin and aunt. His mother, 62, is retired, though she still helps out occasionally.\n\n“She’s worn out, her arm locks, her nerves hurt – from all her hawker years,” Suren explains. “That’s the toll of this job. But she still wants to come and help sometimes.”\n\nTo someone outside the F&B industry, Suren’s daily routine may seem hectic. He gets up at 3.45am daily and reaches the stall just before 5am.\n\nA football fan and Liverpool supporter, on days when there’s a vital Champions League match during the wee hours, he has to watch the game on his phone, while setting up shop.\n\n“I’ll have like five or six burners going on at the same time; I turn to the screen only when a goal is scored.”\n\nWhen I remark that I couldn’t imagine waking up and working so early every day, Suren grins as if he’s heard that line a million times.\n\n“It’s not that hard, 4am. I mean, you’re comparing that to other jobs, but I can show you an even tougher one – the fish (monger) fellas head into work at 1am. The prawn mee seller (also at Ghim Moh) comes in at 1.30am. So there are tougher jobs, but you shouldn’t compare,” he says.\n\n“My mental stress is very low. I’ve worked in an office before and I know how it was working under another person barking orders, and with targets to meet. Here, I don’t have all that. I get to dictate the way things are run and decide my own hours.”\n\nMarried for the past 11 years, Suren is also a new father after his wife gave birth to twin girls last August.\n\nWith such working hours, does he even have time for family, or a social life?\n\n“I’m very strict with my working hours – by 2pm, I’m out of here,” he says. “I sleep at around 9pm, so from 2pm till then I have a lot of time to do things. I can have beers with friends, dinner with my wife and spend time with my kids.”\n\nSuren wasn’t always savvy with his work hours. At Simpang Bedok, he ran his stall from 6am to 10pm.\n\n“That time, I wanted to squeeze every dollar I could, and so I did it the old school hawker way. Then I realised, why am I doing this? In the long run, I’d be exhausted and without a life.\n\n“Seeing my mother have trouble with her arm also made me think. I figured I needed to work smart; there was no need to suffer every day for 14-16 hours.”\n\nThough he may have his working hours and routine sorted, there are still some issues Suren has to contend with from time to time, such as hawker centre closures.\n\nThe Ghim Moh Food Centre will close for renovations from today (March 1) till May 11.\n\n“I might drive a taxi or Grab in the meantime, or I could take up an offer to do a pop-up stall,” he says, referring to a temporary thosai and appam station at various events.\n\nAfter his venture at Simpang Bedok closed, Suren set up such stations during functions organised by banks and companies, and once even at the prime minister’s house.\n\n“That all stopped during Covid, but I might start one up again until my stall can reopen.”\n\n“I’ve worked in an office before and I know how it was working under another person barking orders, and with targets to meet. Here, I don’t have all that.”\n\nHawker Daniel Surendran (left) serving a customer at his Heaven’s stall \nin Ghim Moh.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4729bea3a8e43feffa4ead3c0bf411c5d3f6d0fd9ae4f025d829452c1fc1cc98?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Even my honeymoon was in India,” he said.\n\nYip has painted a mural in Singapore’s Chinatown, opposite the Sri Mariamman temple, in which an Indian Muslim “mamak shop” is depicted. “(Those shops) were where, as a boy, I first learnt to say ‘kalai vanakkam’ (good morning in Tamil),” he said.\n\nLast year, he was commissioned to paint a mural on the walls of the Arya Samaj building in Syed Alwi Road depicting North Indian culture in India and Singapore.\n\nHe has also drawn Indian cultural motifs – a flower shop and a provision shop – on the walls of Changi Airport, and an Indian wedding on a rock in the Botanic Gardens.\n\n“My biggest worry is that the faces in my murals do not look Indian enough,” said Yip. “At least in the case of Malays, their facial features are closer to the Chinese.”\n\nMr V. Jeevananthan, a painter with the Start India group, expressed his admiration for Yip’s work in Coimbatore.\n\n“Unlike other artists, Mr Yip did not use a projector for basic sketching,” he said. “Instead, he used freehand drawing, which is a great risk as it may not bring out the exact proportions.\n\n“But he brought out the right proportions of the human models and the eatables.

She said the boy had been attending the pre-school for more than a year, but it was only in January 2024 that she noticed the child was becoming more and more afraid of going to school.\n\nIn the evenings, meltdowns and nightmares were becoming more frequent, and he was also engaging in violent behaviour like pinching and “chopping” others, she said.\n\nOn the night of Feb 22, her son confided in her, saying his teachers had locked him in a dark room the day before, and that it had been punishment for playing with water in the school’s bathroom. He said was alone in the room, but it is unclear for how long he was confined.\n\nThe mother said she reported the incident to the school on Feb 23.\n\nA few nights later, the boy told the mother that the teachers had pinched him the day he was locked in the room.\n\nSpeaking to The Straits Times, she said: “Two teachers took turns to open the door to shout at him and intimidate him as he stood there crying.”\n\nIn an e-mail circular sent to parents, the pre-school’s director said the school was alerted to a recent case of “child mismanagement” and was “taking action to address this matter”.\n\nThe school has reported the incident to the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and is fully cooperating with investigations, said the director.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAn apple farmer, an airline caterer and an out-of-work graduate are among the Indian nationals hired by Moscow, with the help of recruiters around the world, for the Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nTwo years into the war, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, and Moscow is on a global quest for more combatants, sometimes with the assistance – complicit or oblivious – of informal intermediaries.\n\nAn Indian translator working in a military recruitment centre in Moscow told Agence France-Presse journalists in New Delhi that his facility was one of a network across Russia.\n\n“Every major city has a recruitment centre where foreign nationals are processed,” he said.\n\nHe had personally overseen the enlistment of between 70 and 100 Indian citizens, he said, adding that the number of Nepali hires was significantly higher.\n\n“Just last week, 10 Indians came to my centre,” said the man, who asked for anonymity.\n\nSome Indian recruits told AFP they were promised non-combatant roles, but were trained to use Kalashnikov assault rifles and other weapons before being sent to Ukraine.\n\nAnd a Russian-language Defence Ministry contract seen by AFP refers to “military service in the armed forces of the Russian Federation”, with a requirement to “participate in hostilities” and “serve Russia without limit”.\n\nIndia is a longstanding ally of Russia, and has shied away from explicit condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts say Russian efforts to target recruits from India are just one facet of a global recruitment drive, alongside a vast campaign at home.\n\nAFP spoke to five Indians recruited to join the Russian war effort, all of whom said they had responded to social media videos promoting jobs as “army helpers” for salaries of around US$1,200 ($1,615) a month.\n\nThe clips were posted by a Dubai-based recruitment agent Faisal Khan, who has a presence on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok as Baba Vlogs.\n\nIn one video, Mr Khan walks down a street in Russia’s St Petersburg, spelling out the offer: pay him US$3,600 and get a job as a helper in the Russian army.\n\n“You don’t have to fight,” he says, filming himself on his mobile.\n\n“All you have to do is to clear demolished buildings, look after armouries, and after a year of service you’ll be eligible for permanent residence.”\n\nIn no time, he said, he received an avalanche of inquiries from India. By his own account, he has facilitated 16 Indian passport holders to go to Russia in November and December.\n\nMr Khan told AFP he had been “taken aback” when recruits were issued weapons, and when “reports began coming in of bodies being sent back, and some returning injured”.\n\n“We decided to put a stop to the recruitment process,” he said.\n\nBut his St Petersburg video, headlined “Russia Army Jobs”, has remained online.\n\nOne of Mr Khan’s recruits, an unemployed graduate from Uttar Pradesh, told AFP he had fought on the front line in the Donetsk region in Russian-occupied Ukraine.\n\n“I was hurt in the fighting and taken to hospital, from where I somehow escaped,” he said from Moscow, where he is hoping for repatriation.\n\nAnother said he had been stationed in Kherson region alongside another Indian – an apple farmer from Kashmir – and nine Cubans to await deployment to the front lines.\n\n“I can be called over to fight anytime,” said the 27-year-old from Gulbarga in Karnataka, who used to work at an airline catering company. “I am scared and I just want to go home.”\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine will say how many foreigners are serving in their militaries, or how many they are holding as prisoners of war.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in New Delhi has confirmed that some Indian citizens have signed up for “support jobs” with the Russian army, without specifying whether they were combat roles.\n\nIt said several had been discharged as a result of its interventions with the Russian authorities.\n\nBut families of the recruits say they were tricked, and blame the Indian authorities for not doing enough to extricate them from their predicament.\n\nMr Mohammed Imran, a trader in Hyderabad, has not heard from his 30-year-old brother for two months.\n\nMr Mohammed Asfan had last called from the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don to say that he had been deployed to the front lines.\n\n“One of the boys who was with him and managed to escape told us my brother had been wounded by a bullet,” Mr Imran told AFP.\n\n“He went so that he could offer a better life to his family, now we don’t know if he is even alive.”\n\nAFP\n\n“I can be called over to fight anytime...

Santosh Kumar\n\nAfter completing his GCE ‘N’ levels in 2012, Kevin William found himself captivated by a fleeting desire: to make movies.\n\nDespite being only a teenager and lacking experience and equipment, the Singaporean, armed with just his passion for filmmaking – and an Android HTC One V phone – took his first step into the unknown and created a short film.\n\n“It was my friend’s encouragement that propelled me. I thought, why not give it a shot?” Kevin, 28, recalled.\n\nResiding in Ang Mo Kio at the time, Kevin, with the help of his friends, made a 45-minute Tamil film shot primarily in his neighbourhood. It tackled themes such as gangsterism and substance abuse.\n\nTwo years later, he took the ambitious step of setting up Filmoholic Pictures, a boutique production house dedicated to nurturing the local film landscape.\n\nIn 2016, again with the help of his friends who doubled up as cast members and production crew, the independent studio unveiled its maiden Tamil short film, Yogi.\n\n“I drew inspiration from movies like Vaanam and Ayutha Ezhuthu, and wanted to create a similar narrative style. Yogi explores the interconnected lives of three characters and has a compelling conclusion,” Kevin said.\n\nYogi premiered at GV Yishun cinemas that year, marking a significant milestone for Filmoholic Pictures.\n\nWith the relative success of Yogi, Kevin then set his sights on making his first full-length feature.\n\nInitially titled Thalli Pogathey, the project ran into financial and logistical issues before getting scrapped. Later on, with encouragement from his producer, Kevin revived the project, renaming it Enthan Uyir Thozhi.\n\nThe film’s premiere at Rex cinemas in November 2017 fell short of expectations, with only about 300 attendees.\n\n“I had exhausted all my finances and even told my producer that we might not break even. He was extremely understanding. I wasn’t disheartened… I chose to learn from the experience,” Kevin said.\n\nIn 2018, while in national service, Kevin began scripting Yogi 2: The Prequel, the plot revolving around three sets of characters; a group of aspiring filmmakers, a man bent on revenge and a gang of drug traffickers, whose stories converge at the climax.\n\nWith a larger and more skilled cast and crew, Kevin was better prepared for the task at hand.\n\n“I realised the power of social media as a platform for branding. That’s exactly what Yogi 2 needed,” Kevin said. “Before filming began, we intensified our promotional efforts through social media, realising that our voice was the missing ingredient for visibility.”\n\nYogi 2 premiered to a packed audience and received a positive response from the community, including local celebrities and industry veterans.\n\n“Filmmaking in Singapore is manageable with the right guidance,” Kevin said. “Never hesitate to pursue your passions. Better yet, take charge and make your voice heard.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fe4b44bf9de356ddf9b663c3b32ed2af243cfe47eae38384dd587d0330f43d51?w=825", "alt_text": "Kevin William, 28, manages Filmoholic Pictures, a local independent production house."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn fake videos that have gone viral online, two of India’s A-list Bollywood actors are seen criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asking people to vote for the opposition Congress party in the country’s ongoing general elections.\n\nIn two separate videos, actors Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh are purportedly seen saying that Mr Modi failed to keep campaign promises and address critical economic issues during his two terms as prime minister.\n\nBoth AI-generated videos end with the Congress election symbol and slogan: “Vote for Justice, Vote for Congress.” The two videos have been viewed on social media more than half a million times since last week, a Reuters review shows.\n\nTheir spread underlines the potential role such AI (artificial intelligence)-generated content can play in the mammoth Indian elections that started last Friday and will continue until June.\n\nAI and AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including the United States, Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nCampaigning in India has long focused on door-to-door outreach and public rallies, but extensive use of WhatsApp and Facebook as campaigning tools started in 2019. This year’s general elections – in which Mr Modi is expected to secure a rare third term – is the first in which AI is being used.\n\nCongress spokesperson Sujata Paul shared Ranveer’s video with her 16,000 followers on X on April 17. By April 19, her post had been re-shared 2,900 times, liked 8,700 times and received 438,000 views.\n\nMs Sujata told Reuters that she was aware the video was marked “manipulated media” by X, but she did not want to delete it as, while posting, she thought the person was a lookalike of the actor and “it has creativity for sure”.\n\nThe post was no longer visible on X on April 20, hours after Reuters sent a request for comment to Congress’ head of social media cell, who did not respond.\n\nBoth actors have said the videos are fake. Facebook, X and at least eight fact-checking websites have said they are altered or manipulated, which the Reuters digital verification unit has also confirmed.\n\nReuters could not ascertain who created the videos.\n\nAamir was “alarmed” by the viral fake video and Ranveer’s team was looking into the matter, according to a spokesperson for both actors. Ranveer wrote on X on Friday: “Beware of deepfakes, friends”.\n\nMr Modi’s office and the IT head of his Bharatiya Janata Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNearly 900 million people in India (64 per cent of the population) have access to the Internet and a survey conducted by research organisation Esya Centre and the Indian Institute of Management business school showed an average Indian spends more than three hours a day on social media. The country has nearly one billion voters.\n\nThe videos have sparked a police investigation with Aamir registering a case in Mumbai against unnamed persons on April 17 for alleged impersonation and cheating – as part of the creation of a fake video.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Maharashtra police’s cyber cell registered a first information report (FIR) against an X user for allegedly uploading the Ranveer deepfake video.\n\nThe FIR was registered on a complaint by the actor’s father Jagjit Singh Bhavnani against the user @sujataindia1st, a police officer told the Hindustan Times.\n\nIn this year’s elections, politicians are using AI in other ways.\n\nIn south India, Congress leader Vijay Vasanth’s spokesperson said his team created a two-minute video clip using AI that was shared on social media platforms showing his deceased politician father H. Vasanthakumar seeking votes for him.\n\nThe late politician is seen saying “even though my body left you all, my soul is still around”.\n\nIn videos posted on YouTube by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), Samata, an AI-generated anchor dressed in a traditional sari and speaking in a style that mimics regular news channels, criticises the ruling party in West Bengal.\n\nIn one clip, the anchor alleges the party does not care about the environment, as many water bodies have vanished due to illegal construction.\n\nA spokesperson for the ruling party denied the allegation and said the state government has ensured no such construction is taking place.

Santosh Kumar\n\nRecently, Singapore resident Ashwath Kaushik became the youngest to beat a grandmaster in classical or regular chess. The young contender was just eight years and six months old.\n\nMany parents would surely rejoice over such triumphs because we want our children to be the best they can be.\n\nIn Singapore, that could also mean becoming a world-class pianist or violinist, a Grand Slam champion or the next Joseph Schooling or Joscelin Yeo.\n\nNRI parents would probably add a cricket champion into the mix.\n\nThere is no doubt these accomplishments take a lot of time, effort and commitment.\n\nAshwath practises his chess moves about two hours each weekday, and six to seven hours daily on weekends.\n\nHe also travels overseas almost every month for tournaments and has played games that can last up to 5½ hours each. That alone is an eternity for many eight-year-olds.\n\nHowever, his father, who is a managing director of a management consulting firm, is not pushing the young star. He told the media after his son’s achievement: “The key is to have balance, and not set unrealistic timelines and records because the reality is that the kid is not pursuing it full-time.”\n\nUnfortunately, some parents can get very pushy. There have been instances of fathers with stopwatches along the lengths of swimming pools pushing and urging their children to swim faster.\n\nSports coaches say the stress could quickly become too much for kids to handle.\n\nThen there is the misconception that early success guarantees continued success, despite many cases where a child prodigy fails to live up to expectations.\n\nAttaining and maintaining high performance standards especially in sports depend on several factors – physical ability, mental aptitude and, crucially, their “love of the game”.\n\nWhen parents make the activity seem like work, the child is going to see it in the same way, and may not enjoy it any more. When passion diminishes, all is often lost.\n\nParents would do better by supporting their children in something they love doing.\n\nAs author Tara Bianca observed, there is a stark contrast between the child who has been forced to learn to play the piano and the child who is deeply inspired to learn music.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/369db64a9034e9330be8a8e4408ff7bfb4115f125a552e73817f61794bde8961?w=825", "alt_text": "Chess player Ashwath Kaushik."}]}

They would ask: What’s the big deal?\n\nRightly so, since the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) template for transitions is drawn from the coordinates of stable continuity. Unlike countries where a change of premiership drives people and markets into a tizzy, transitions in Singapore are devoid of political or economic drama.\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew was prime minister from 1959 to 1990, and Mr Goh Chok Tong from 1990 to 2004, when Mr Lee Hsien Loong succeeded him. Each transition was meaningful, in that an elder leader handed over the reins to a younger one, but there was no fear of jarring discontinuity.\n\nSo it should be with Mr Wong, who will take over the mantle of leadership soon.\n\nWhat is the secret of this seamless transition? It is the recognition of the reality that Singapore is far too small to experiment with centrifugal change.\n\nElection after election, Singaporeans vote for continuity predicated on their expectations of stability. Of course, the opposition has been gaining traction, but not so much as to overtake the running record of the PAP which, after all, is the party of Independence that was achieved after separation from Malaysia in 1965.\n\nAnd even the opposition themselves do not speak in the language of messianic change but in that of incremental advances towards the kind of society that it prefers.\n\nIn the PAP itself, continuity is in fine display. Take public housing. It has been treated as a centrepiece of nation-building since the Lee Kuan Yew years because it serves to anchor newer generations of a largely immigrant population in this island city state.\n\nSoldiers in a conscript military will defend what they themselves possess – the homes inhabited by their grandparents, parents, spouses and children.\n\nAlso, the Ethnic Integration Policy practised in Housing Board precincts ensures that they reflect the national ethnic profile so that people’s penchant of seeking to stay near their own kind does not produce ethnic ghettos in which the minorities are driven to the margins of the housing landscape. While public housing policy is tweaked to incorporate the rising expectations of Singaporeans, there is no doubt that the principles behind that policy have stayed constant through three prime ministers.\n\nNational Service is another cardinal state policy. The philosophy behind it is that no country will help defend a nation unless its own citizens are prepared to do so. It would not have been feasible to raise a regular armed force of sufficient size to protect Singapore given its small population. Hence the need for conscription. The public understanding and acceptance of this logic has underpinned Singapore’s security for more than half a century. NS is a national institution.\n\nFrom one prime minister to the next, such fundamentals of state policy have remained untouched. This is why the latest transition could be expected to last.\n\nMr Wong inherits what could be called PAP genes: a fundamental emphasis on fiscal prudence in the conduct of economic affairs; a non-negotiable approach to the primacy of law and order in domestic society; an appreciation of the anchoring role of multiracialism; and an acute awareness of how, in spite of these priorities, Singapore’s place in global affairs remains fragile.\n\nOf particular importance is the outbreak of great-power discord between the United States and China, a development that could affect Singapore deeply given its close ties with both powers.\n\nThere are other challenges as well. Globalisation benefits Singapore by plugging it into the international hinterland, but it also creates domestic problems by dividing Singaporeans between globalised cosmopolitans and localised heartlanders. This formulation is drawn from the Goh Chok Tong years but it has retained some of its agency in the decades since.\n\nThe Government has responded to this particular challenge by amending the educational and employment system in a way that allows more Singaporeans to participate in the country’s global journey.\n\nHowever, challenges and threats remain because Singapore, unlike larger countries, cannot turn inwards and ultimately become isolationist. It remains in many ways a price-taker in the international economy.\n\nThat said, it has developed a habit of punching above its weight in global affairs. So long as Singaporeans by and large are prepared to remain in the ring, Singapore will prevail. A strong Singapore dollar and the deterrent power of the Singapore Armed Forces would ensure that this country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be taken for granted by international predators or adventurers.\n\nThis is what Mr Lee Hsien Loong the man and Singapore under his leadership have achieved collectively. Mr Wong has much to build on.\n\nPM Lee gifting a framed front page of Tamil Murasu (dated 11 August 1965) to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Istana on Nov 24, 2015.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAfter a seven-year wait and multiple court battles in India, Ms Prema Kumari, a senior citizen from Kerala, finally met her daughter Nimisha Priya, a nurse who is on death row in a Yemeni prison.\n\nPriya’s India-based lawyer Subhash Chandran said the mother-daughter duo met at the jail in Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHe told news channel Wion that the jail authorities permitted the mother-daughter duo to spend a few hours together and even allowed them to have lunch on the premises.\n\nKerala-native Priya was convicted of the 2017 murder of local man Talal Abdo Mahdi.\n\nThe daughter of a domestic helper, she went to Yemen in 2008 and initially worked as a nurse in a government-run hospital in Sanaa, but later quit her low-paying job to start her own clinic in 2014.\n\nAs the law in Yemen mandated her to have a local partner, she opened the clinic jointly with Mr Mahdi, a local store owner.\n\nBut her lawyer said the Yemeni later subjected her to physical and mental abuse and confiscated her passport.\n\nIn a desperate bid to escape the abuse and flee, Priya reportedly drugged Mr Mahdi, which is suspected to have led to his death.\n\nThe case got further complicated after Mr Mahdi’s chopped-up body was found by the authorities in a water tank. Priya was found guilty of murder.\n\nHer lawyer maintains that she was responsible only for drugging the abuser, and that she is not aware of what transpired after.\n\nIn November, Yemen’s Supreme Judicial Council rejected her appeal, clearing the way for her execution.\n\nPriya’s family had been unable to travel to Yemen earlier since a 2017 Indian government ban on citizens travelling there remains, and those needing to travel need special permission.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs had rejected their request, saying Delhi didn’t have a diplomatic presence in Yemen to ensure their safety.\n\nThe lobby group Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council then filed a petition in the Delhi high court, seeking permission for Priya’s mother and daughter to travel to Sana’a. The court allowed them to travel but said the Indian government would not be liable if anything goes wrong.\n\nSana’a is controlled by Houthi rebels who have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen’s government, which is based in the southern city of Aden. India does not recognise the Houthis, so a trip to Yemen for Indian citizens could be fraught with dangers.\n\nThe BBC reported that Priya’s husband Tomy Thomas and 11-year-old daughter Mishal are also in Sana’a, accompanied by Mr Samuel Jerome Bhaskaran, a member of the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, which has been attempting to get Priya released from jail.\n\nOn Monday, Ms Kumari and Mr Samuel undertook an overnight car journey from Aden to Sana’a and reached the Houthi-controlled region on Tuesday, reported Wion.\n\nWith the support of Indian diplomatic representatives, they completed the formalities and met Priya on April 24.\n\nIn a WhatsApp message shared with the council, Mr Samuel termed the mother-daughter reunion as an “emotional” moment.\n\n“They were allowed to stay together for some time as we went out and brought lunch for both of them,” he said.\n\nLawyer Chandran told Wion that the mother is now making attempts to meet the family of Mr Mahdi and plead for mercy.\n\nThis is a possibility, owing to the concept of “diyah” or “blood money”, which is practised in Islamic Sharia Law. Diyah is the compensation paid by the perpetrator’s family, as demanded by the victim’s family.\n\nLast December, Ms Kumari told the BBC that she wanted to travel to Yemen to seek “forgiveness” from Mr Mahdi’s family.\n\n“I will apologise to them, I’ll tell them, take my life, but please spare my daughter. Nimisha has a young daughter who needs her mother,” Ms Kumari said.\n\nRecently, thousands of people from Kerala and even non-resident Malayalees crowdfunded Rs 34 crore ($5.5 million) to pay “diyah” and free Malayalee Abdul Rahim, who had been on death row in Saudi Arabia.\n\nRahim is said to have accidentally caused the death of a disabled child who was under his care.\n\nNimisha Priya.\n\n“I will apologise to them, I’ll tell them, take my life, but please spare my daughter.”\n\nMs Prema Kumari on the possibility of meeting the victim’s family and asking for mercy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4b219c884f97845b9010beb36301c45b6e912a43f429654a66636f4b5dd017bc?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Prema Kumari (second from right) with Mr Samuel Jerome Bhaskaran (far left) and Indian representatives in Sana’a on Wednesday."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMs Mala Mahesh, the co-founder of shipping and logistics company Transworld Group Singapore, published her debut novel Padma in April 2022.\n\nIt told the tale of two Indian women from different centuries whose lives were torn apart after being embroiled in infertility issues.\n\nFollowing a successful print run, with the book receiving a 4.5/5 rating on Amazon, Ms Mala decided to get it translated into Tamil, her native language.\n\nThe Tamil version of Padma was launched by Member of Parliament Vikram Nair on April 20 at the National Library Building in Singapore.\n\n“I got the book translated mainly for my grandmother,” said Ms Mala. “She loves to read in Tamil. The ideas for the two stories in the book also came from her.\n\n“If more people are to read my book, it has to be translated into different languages. The Hindu publishing group helped with the Tamil translation.”\n\nFor generations in India, the worth of a woman’s life has often been equated to her reproductive abilities, with little regard to how truly challenging the process of procreation can be.\n\nRarely have stories been told about difficult pregnancies, miscarriages and infertility – mainly because discussing the issues make people uncomfortable.\n\nMs Mala brought one of these taboo topics to the fore through Padma.\n\n“Actually, infertility is a small part of the book, it is mainly about women empowerment; how a woman should be able to take some decisions on her own,” she said.\n\nThrough their company, Ms Mala and her husband Mahesh Sivasamy have set up a foundation in India which provides education to young girls.\n\n“The institute teaches the basics, like computer literacy, which in turn help girls take up jobs in areas like data entry. The idea is to make them financially independent,” Ms Mala explained.\n\nShe has plans to write her second novel.\n\n“There are a few ideas, but finding the time is a problem with my duties co-managing the company,” she said. “It will take me a while to put my thoughts into a book, and it is painstaking work.”\n\nThe Tamil version of Padma is available for purchase on Ms Mala’s website: https://www.malamahesh.com\n\nV.K.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFilmmaker Payal Kapadia says it is an immense honour that her film All We Imagine As Light is part of the Competition section of the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIt is the first Indian film in 30 years – and the first by an Indian female director – to be screened under the main segment of the prestigious film gala, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\nThe last Indian film to vie for the top prize in Cannes was Swaham (My Own), directed by Malayalam filmmaker Shaji N Karun in 1994.\n\nPreviously, the section was frequented for decades by Indian masters like Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen.\n\nWhen Swaham was selected to the Cannes competition, sitting along with Karun on the high table of world cinema 30 years ago were cinema legends such as Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski (Three Colours: Red), Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami (Through the Olive Trees) and Chinese director Zhang Yimou (To Live).\n\nA newcomer from the US called Quentin Tarantino walked away with the Palme d’Or that year for his cult film, Pulp Fiction.\n\nAt this year’s Cannes festival, to be held from May 14 to 25, Kapadia will be joined in the Palme d’Or race by cinematic heavyweights like American director Francis Ford Coppola, Canadian director David Cronenberg, Chinese director Jia Zhangke, French director Jacques Audiard, Italian director Paolo Sorrentino and another American legend, Paul Schrader.\n\nCoppola and Audiard are former winners of the Cannes top prize.\n\n“Being selected at Cannes is truly thrilling and humbling, especially considering how much I admire many directors selected in this section,” Kapadia said.\n\nAll We Imagine As Light, also written by Kapadia, marks her narrative feature debut. The Malayalam-Hindi feature will be screened alongside 19 other titles, including Coppola’s Megalopolis and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Kinds of Kindness.\n\nOh Canada by Paul Schrader, Bird by Andrea Arnold, The Shrouds by David Cronenberg and Anora by Sean Baker are also part of the main competition slate.\n\nKapadia, an alumna of the Film & Television Institute of India (FTII), is best known for her acclaimed documentary A Night Of Knowing Nothing, which premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival’s Director’s Fortnight side-bar where it won the Oeil d’or (Golden Eye) award.\n\nShe is no stranger to Cannes. In 2017, her short film Afternoon Clouds became the FTII’s first student film selected by Cannes for its film school competition, now called La Cinef.\n\nThe point of departure for All We Imagine As Light, the story of two nurses from Kerala working at a Mumbai hospital, was the director’s experience of living with her nonagenarian grandmother who required a nurse day and night for care, the subject of Afternoon Clouds.\n\nTwo Malayalam actresses – Kani Kusruti and Divya Prabha – play the lead roles.\n\nAll We Imagine As Light portrays the sensitive gender and cultural politics in the country via the story of the two nurses – Prabha (Kani) and Anu (Divya). When Prabha receives an unexpected gift from her estranged husband, it throws her life into disarray.\n\nNo Indian film has won the Palme d’Or, including Ray’s Pather Panchali in 1956, a miss still rued by the cinema world as a momentous error. Pather Panchali was instead bestowed the Best Human Document award in Cannes.\n\n“Indian cinema should take Payal Kapadia’s lead in the future,” said Karun, who sees the young Mumbai-based director imbibing a higher standard of cinematic philosophy that gives her works a rare sense of aesthetics and visual language.\n\n“Payal’s gender interpretations in her works allow them to stand out in Indian cinema,” said Karun, who won a Camera d’Or Mention in Cannes for his debut film, Piravi, in 1989.\n\nThe official selection to the competition section and other categories this year includes Indian director Sandhya Suri’s debut feature film Santosh.\n\n“Indian cinema should take Payal Kapadia’s lead in the future.”\n\nShaji N Karun, who was the last Indian filmmaker to vie for the top prize at Cannes in 1994", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3fb3baee664e7000a3270e9a68b6b9725a0a399bab0929ea6fef0d20fee8f2b6?w=825", "alt_text": "All We Imagine As Light tells the story of two nurses – Prabha (Kani Kusruti, left) and Anu (Divya Prabha) – from Kerala who work in a nursing home in Mumbai."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndia’s D. Gukesh was not the popular choice to win the title at the FIDE Candidates Chess tournament in Toronto last weekend.\n\nThe 17-year-old, who had become a Grandmaster five years ago, was given no chance by many experts in the final contest to determine the challenger for the World Chess Championship.\n\nFormer world champion Magnus Carlsen said before the start of the tournament about the Chennai native who was making his first appearance at the Candidates: “I cannot imagine him winning the Candidates. I think he will certainly win at least a couple of games, but will have some fairly bad losses as well. I don’t think he will do poorly, but I don’t think he will do too well either.\n\n“He’s not quite ready yet to make the leap. It’s more likely that he will have a bad event.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Gukesh became the youngest Candidates champion and will take on reigning champion Ding Liren of China for the world title in November.\n\nCarlsen, who opted out of the tournament, had picked two-time World Championship contender Ian Nepomniachtchi, World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana and World No. 3 Hikaru Nakamura as the favourites. The trio finished half a point behind Gukesh.\n\n“Gukesh is probably a bit stronger than myself and others I realised,” said Carlsen on Monday. “The thing about Gukesh is that he can look really vulnerable at times. He’s also not very good at speed chess – that can confuse (people’s assessment about him). And he’s not as high-profile as some of the other youngsters, which is confusing. But he’s proven in this tournament that he’s very strong.”\n\nGukesh told India Today that Carlsen’s words didn’t faze him. He said he was confident about his winning ability despite having qualified for the Candidates last among the three Indian contenders – the other two being R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi.\n\n“I actually came to know about that (Carlsen’s comments) a couple of days before the Candidates (started),” Gukesh said on Monday.\n\n“Honestly, I didn’t care much about it. I think he gave an honest opinion. Obviously, I was not the favourite there. There were far more experienced players.\n\n“Deep down, I knew that if I was in my best shape, and if I managed to stay calm and focused, I could win the tournament.”\n\nGukesh’s only loss came against French Firouza Alireza in the seventh round. He said it was that “painful” defeat which gave him the extra motivation for the remainder of the tournament.\n\n“It was a very painful loss. But after that, I had a rest day. When I woke up, I felt at my absolute best shape, full of energy,” said Gukesh.\n\nGukesh, ranked 16th in the world by the International Chess Federation (FIDE), sealed his title after a comfortable draw with Nakamura, a five-time US chess champion who is more than twice his age.\n\nThe Indian became the youngest player ever to challenge for a world chess title.\n\n“I was completely emotional, but after the game I’m feeling quite good,” Gukesh said. “I don’t really care about being the youngest and all these records, but it’s a nice thing to say.”\n\nShould Gukesh beat Ding, who has struggled with poor form recently, at the 2024 World Chess Championship later this year, he will break Garry Kasparov’s long-held record of being the youngest world champion aged 22.\n\n“I don’t really care about being the youngest and all these records, but it’s a nice thing to say.”\n\nIndia’s D.

Santosh Kumar\n\nV.K. SANTOSH KUMAR\n\nFor Singaporean actor Mathi Alagan, it was an “incredible opportunity” to feature in Dev Patel’s directorial debut Monkey Man, which released globally on April 4.\n\nThe 59-year-old, who has starred in several TV series like Mediacorp’s Tanglin (2015 to 2018) and Tamil films like Penguin (2020), plays an arms dealer in the Hollywood venture, which follows the story of Kid, played by Patel, 33, who is out to avenge a past wrong.\n\n“It was a natural progression for me, after acting in Tamil stage and TV shows in Singapore, English programmes and then doing Tamil series and movies in India,” Mathi told tabla!. “As an actor with nearly 35 years of experience, you always want to go to the next level.”\n\nMathi revealed that, after his performance as an antagonist in Penguin, his stock went up and “somebody sent my name to the casting people for Monkey Man”.\n\nHe auditioned for three roles and was picked to play the arms dealer, the beefiest.\n\n“I did all the shooting in Batam, where the sets were made to resemble Mumbai,” said  Mathi. “The shooting could not be done in Mumbai earlier due to Covid.\n\n“For me, it was an exploration of new ground. Dev Patel is a big name, and it was exciting to work with him. It was a good opportunity for me as nowadays they are writing meaningful Asian-centric roles.”\n\nMathi was initially apprehensive whether Patel could pull off the movie as the young man played three roles – producer, director and actor.\n\n“But he was brilliant,” said Mathi. “He did not have the air of a multimillionaire bankable star. He was switched on. He had so much energy.\n\n“He hardly slept for two hours a day and would be up at 5am planning for the shoot. He was dedicated and was alway approachable for discussions.\n\n“We spent a lot of time together and even went swimming. He kept me relaxed throughout the shoot.”\n\nFollowing his Monkey Man role, Mathi beleives “he has done everything in acting”.\n\nHe wrote and directed a 24-part Malaysian TV series last year which was a hit.\n\n“That’s where my future is,” he said. “Writing and directing - it’s new energy, gets my blood boiling.”\n\n“As an actor with nearly 35 years of experience, you always want to go to the next level.”\n\nSingaporean actor Mathi Alagan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2578f338527f063ff6f755670ee57f912d7e1d33d5caaba5e1c0a396a0453f2a?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

And, while we weren’t friends at the time, he often stood out from the crowd because of his appearance.\n\nSince he was four years old, Col Anand has been coping with vitiligo (pronounced vee-tuh-lai-go), a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes patches of skin to lose pigment or colour. Although treatment can help restore lost skin colour, there is no known cure.\n\nYour vitiligo is a bit different from before, I say to him.\n\n“It moves,” he replies. “If I show you a photo of me at four years old, (the condition) would look like how it is now – but if I show you a pic of me at 12, it’s different.”\n\nCol Anand, Commander, 6th Singapore Division/ Headquarters Sense and Strike, in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), recalls the time he first spoke to a doctor about his condition.\n\n“The doctor explained there was no oral medication he could give me – or cure – because there was no ‘system problem’, meaning also that it wasn’t life-threatening.\n\n“But it’s very endearing to me. It’s been a part of me since I was young.”\n\nWhen asked if it has ever been a hindrance to him in any way, Col Anand says: “My friends and family made a difference. Whether it was in school or the military. I’ve never seen my friends actually feel awkward or perturbed about it.”\n\nCol Anand made the life-changing decision to be a military man at the age of 16, enlisting in the army as part of a scholarship programme that would fund his education.\n\nRight after completing his three-year diploma course at Singapore Polytechnic, he found himself entrenched, so to speak, in a very different lifestyle.\n\n“That first weekend in Pulau Tekong during (basic military training) was probably my first ‘I’m in the army’ moment. You smell the air, look around, and realise ‘oh I have to listen if I want to stay here’,” he says with a laugh.\n\n“Of course, I had some initial doubts over whether I was cut out for this profession. But after I went to specialist cadet school, I realised that this profession has a lot of people who help to nurture you.\n\n“Every time you’re on an assignment, whether you’re on the ground or at the senior level, someone will always reach out to you. ‘Are you okay? Everything all right?’ they’ll ask.\n\n“I love the nurturing aspect of the army, it counterbalanced the fact that I was actually quite rebellious by nature. The leadership traits and the style of the army grew on me very quickly.”\n\nAfter completing cadet school in 2000, Col Anand received another study award and went on to complete a degree in computing at the National University of Singapore.\n\nHis outstanding performance in the SAF propelled him to the rank of full colonel, and today, at the relatively young age of 45, he is in charge of some 20,000 men at the Mandai Hill camp.\n\nWhen I ask if he’s the youngest colonel in the SAF, Col Anand says he’s unsure, but that it’s “highly doubtful”.\n\n“My philosophy towards everything is to do the best you can so that everyone around you – and not just you – would benefit.\n\n“I always remind myself of what I was told by my superiors when I was a trainee – that the rank is temporary, but the person is permanent. That has always stuck with me, so I’ve never really thought about the fact that I’m a division commander now. Don’t get me wrong though; I still understand the magnitude of the job and the responsibilities.”\n\nOn a typical day, Col Anand rises at 4am and does some exercises before taking meetings or doing ground inspections till lunch.\n\n“In a week, no two days are the same,” he says. “Sometimes you’re dealing with national service training issues, sometimes with operations or capability development.\n\n“I end my day a bit late, somewhere around 8pm. Then I head home and spend some quality time with my wife, who’s an amazing cook by the way.”\n\nEvenings on the weekends are strictly for family time, says Col Anand, whose wife Unitha Vasu is a teacher, and son, Maadhav Lohem Vir, is 12 years old.\n\n“Sunday mornings are breakfast time with my son. He’s extremely inquisitive, and asks me a lot of questions about my profession – how do you deal with so many people? Don’t you get tired? Of course, because he’s a young lad, he’ll also ask me things like, ‘do you all use drones to kill people?’.”\n\nSo will Maadhav follow in his father’s footsteps one day?\n\n“Though he’s still young, he understands I’m in a profession where leadership matters,” Col Anand says.\n\n“I’ll say this for someone who wants to be in this profession: It’s challenging and dynamic. You move through many appointments; sometimes you’ll be training in the field, sometimes you’re dealing with paperwork.\n\n“It’s also a team sport. So if you’re someone who’s a better version of yourself when working in a team, you’ll fit right in.\n\n“Finally, if you tend to have a sense of duty towards others, and you care enough to want to help people in all sorts of ways, then the SAF is the place for you.”\n\n“I always remind myself of what I was told by my superiors when I was a trainee – that the rank is temporary, but the person is permanent.”\n\nCol Anand Sathi Kumar (above left) with his wife \nUnitha Vasu and son Maadhav", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/43e2573a1a50ad653b75970adb6c9342f24263d5c52feb23872e863e5c81779a?w=825", "alt_text": "Col Anand Sathi Kumar, Commander, 6th Singapore Division / Headquarters Sense and Strike, in the Singapore Armed Forces."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFor those who believe rags-to-riches stories are the stuff of fairy tales, Sash Simpson’s life will make them wake up and dig into the caviar.\n\nIt is Slumdog Millionaire played out in real life. And it will bring back memories of Lion, the Dev Patel-Nicole Kidman starrer based on the amazing story of Saroo Brierley and his search from Melbourne for his original home in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe story of Sash, an orphan found on the streets of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu who is now one of Toronto’s top chefs, is the subject of a documentary, Born Hungry, by Canadian filmmaker Barry Avrich.\n\nIt recently premiered at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and was then picked up by actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas’ company, Purple Pebble Pictures. It will screen at Hot Docs Film Festival in Toronto on April 26.\n\nThe New York Times said: “Sash Simpson made his name as a chef for Canada’s rich. It’s a magical world away from the dumpsters where he would forage for food when he was just another street kid.”\n\nSash was found on the streets of Coimbatore by volunteers of a Canadian charity named Families for Children. The five-year-old orphan could only remember that his mother had long hair and his father was a deaf and mute labourer.\n\nThey gave him shelter and it was there that he caught the attention of his adoptive mother and Families for Children co-founder Sandra Simpson.\n\nIn a dramatic reversal of fortunes, Sash ended up from the floors of the Coimbatore cinema theatre that he cleaned for the privilege of sleeping on them at night to the upscale Toronto suburb of Forest Hill.\n\nNot a gifted student, Sash was 14 when found his first full-time job as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He then discovered North 44, run by one of Canada’s top chefs Mark McEwan. It was to become his workplace for more than 25 years as he rose to become the executive chef.\n\nNorth 44 closed in 2018 following the expiry of its rental lease, and Sash had to look out for himself all over again. He did what he was best at – he opened the high-class Sash to rave reviews in 2019.\n\nBut, if you go there looking for the welcoming whiff of Coimbatore, you’ll be disappointed.\n\nIt has just two nods to Sash’s origins: Gunpowder Lamb Chops and Sambar with Masala Rice and Masala Beef Short Ribs.\n\nTalking to Nuvo Magazine, Sash said about how he goes about putting together his menu: “Flavours come to me constantly and whatever hits my palate and I go ‘wow, this is really good’. It could be Indian, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean – it doesn’t matter, my crew, my colleagues and I feel it – it’s hitting that menu.”\n\nSash was affected by Covid for two years, but it’s now doing as well as it did before the epidemic swept the world.\n\nMarried to Ms Robin Pitcher, an event manager he met in 2008, Sash is 54 years old and a father of two children.\n\nHe could have turned his back on his past and lived the good life, but in 2018 Sash opened a professional kitchen at the Coimbatore orphanage where his story began.\n\nThe kitchen is to help young women develop skills that would equip them to find jobs in the hospitality or allied industries.\n\nIn his own little way, Sash is paying back the debt he owes the orphanage that changed his life, which is about to experience yet another seismic shift, now that his story has gone global, thanks to Priyanka.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/46a38e0ca43f00f2f08ed3ffd3e9a045776c2476b064fdb38702d014878349a7?w=825", "alt_text": "Sash Simpson (left) cooking on a street in Chennai."}]}

I bought a Korean recipe book of non-vegetarian dishes and converted the dishes to vegetarian. So maybe that’s how I got the hang of doing non-vegetarian food,” she added.\n\nRang Mahal has launched The Great Indian Celebration Feast, a food promotion built around a classical Indian wedding experience. From April 12 to 21, the feast showcases the rich tapestry of India’s gastronomic diversity from various regions across the country.\n\nOfferings include a five-course Thali ($88++ per pax), a 7-course ($138++) and 9-course ($188++) degustation menu, a buffet feast ($88++adult/ $44++kids) and an a la carte menu.\n\nMs Sarita has drawn inspiration from navaratna (nine gemstones representing the heavenly planets; it is also a metaphor for a collection of the best nine) for the nine-course degustation menu, which includes ingredients not usually found in Indian cuisine, such as morels and truffles.\n\nAside from the mustard-based “Langostino Paturi”, the “Himalayan Morels” was another stand-out dish at the tasting. Regarded as one of the world’s costliest mushrooms, the honeycomb-textured caps were stuffed with aged parmesan and goat cheese and finished with truffle salt and truffle oil.\n\nWhat also impressed was the Thecha Biscuti, a smoked chicken tikka dish with lehsuni palak, crispy garlic chips and mint mango salad.\n\n“Everything is about the fresh ingredients, which is the first and most important thing in my job,” Ms Sarita said. She explained that, when curating for destination weddings, the first thing she does in the new country is to visit the local markets.\n\n“We see what’s on offer and get basic ingredients like yogurt, chilies and oil. We are very particular about the medium of cooking we use, so we’ll never use vegetable oil or soybean oil. We use peanut oil or sunflower oil instead.\n\n“I think mustard oil is very underrated. It is hard to get, especially outside India, but the pungent and pronounced flavour of the mustard oil should really be noted.”\n\nSince its beginnings at the now defunct Oberoi Imperial Hotel in Jalan Rumbia, Rang Mahal – now located at the Pan Pacific hotel – has long had a reputation for being the venue for Indian weddings in Singapore.\n\nRang Mahal’s managing director Ritu Jhunjhnuwala said the restaurant used to do a lot of weddings before Covid-19, and the eatery is now looking to re-establish that concept.\n\n“Rang Mahal has always had the kind of vibe where people feel that it’s a place for a celebration,” Ms Ritu said. “So in planning for this, we turned to Sarita, who has worked with us on so many weddings before.\n\n“In a collaboration like this, our chefs learn a lot from Sarita’s team, because they are together for a period of time, learning the preparation methods and new ways of working. So it’s really wonderful to have her and her team here.”\n\nFor reservations and to learn more about the various menus during the promotion, visit www.rangmahal.com.sg.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9f37c959cd6654a0daa05cd05588d5a79d719e4671016c932cf0a976cc7ae411?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA Jain husband and wife from Gujarat have donated their immense wealth (nearly Rs200 crore/$32 million) and embraced monkhood.\n\nAccording to NDTV, they now plan to set out on a journey for salvation.\n\nThe news publication reported that Mr Bhavesh Bhandari and his wife donated all their wealth during a ceremony in February, and will officially commit to a life of renunciation at an event later this month.\n\nThe businessman from Himmatnagar, who was involved in real estate development in Sabarkantha and Ahmedabad and was accustomed to a life of luxury and prosperity from a young age, follows in the footsteps of his 19-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son who adopted monkhood in 2022.\n\nPeople from their community said he and his wife were inspired by their children to “renounce their material attachments and join the ascetic path”.\n\nWhen the children embraced monkhood, Mr Bhandari reportedly said: “My children were raised amid the teachings of monks and had the opportunity to spend time with them during the lockdown, which inspired them to become monks.”\n\nThe Bhandari couple, along with 35 others, took out a procession spanning four kilometres where they donated all their possessions, including their mobile phones and air-conditioners. Videos of the procession show the couple atop a chariot dressed like royalty.\n\nAfter taking the pledge on April 22, the couple will have to sever all family ties and won’t be allowed to keep any “materialistic objects”. They will then walk barefoot across India and survive only on alms.\n\nThey will be allowed to own only two white garments, a bowl for alms and a “rajoharan”, a white broom Jain monks use to brush insects away from an area before they sit – a mark of the path of non-violence they follow.\n\nIn Jainism, taking “diksha” is a significant commitment where the individual lives without material comforts, surviving on alms and wandering barefoot across the country.\n\nThe Bhandari family join a handful of others like Mr Bhavaralal Jain, who had previously turned away from billions to lead a life of restraint. He pioneered the micro-irrigation system in India.\n\nLast year, a multi-millionaire diamond merchant and his wife in Gujarat made a similar move, five years after their 12-year-old son adopted monkhood.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6917b3523b74bae049e7aa53562f494dd206e237f9e63416c8f4746366990ff1?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Sindhu has overhauled her life in an all-out bid to land an Olympic badminton gold in Paris this July, after having to settle for silver and bronze in the previous two Games.\n\nShe is now living in Bengaluru, India, far from Hyderabad, where she trained through most of her career, the highlights of which include bagging the singles silver in Rio 2016, bronze in Tokyo and being crowned world champion in 2019.\n\nThe move in October was deemed essential for Sindhu, who wanted to be closer to her new mentor, Prakash Padukone, the Indian badminton great and father of Bollywood superstar Deepika Padukone.\n\nThat was not the only change she has made as she gears up to be “smarter” for the 2024 Olympics in France, having in recent months replaced several members of her team, from her personal fitness trainer to her physiotherapist.\n\nIndonesia’s Agus Dwi Santoso is now coaching Sindhu, who parted company with Malaysia’s Muhammad Hafiz Hashim, whom she initially said last July she would work with after splitting with long-time coach Park Tae-sang earlier in 2023.\n\n“I’d been training with Hafiz and then I wanted some change – I thought it was not suiting my game – and that’s when I asked Agus,” Sindhu told Reuters.\n\n“It’s a new year, a new team. Every aspect I touch on is going to be completely different. Paris is something that’s an ultimate game for us. I think we need to be 100 per cent in every aspect, physically, in skill and in strategy.\n\nSindhu, who has previously raised awareness about the stigma surrounding prioritising mental health in sports, said she also has a “mental trainer”.\n\n“Some of it is meditation but, at the same time, it’s important that you know what’s going on in your head while playing, there’s a lot of pressure or responsibility, a lot of expectation,” she said.\n\nSindhu is the only Indian to become badminton world champion and only the second individual athlete from India to win two consecutive medals at the Games.\n\n“If I want to achieve something – and my aim is to achieve the Olympic gold – then I would do anything for it,” she said. “It means everything to me.”\n\nHowever, Sindhu has found the going tough in recent months, following her attempts to bounce back on the world stage after fairing poorly last season mainly because of an ankle injury.\n\nOn April 11, she lost in the last-16 of the Badminton Asia Championships in Ningbo, China. The world No. 12 went down to world No. 7 Han Yue 18-21, 21-13, 17-21.\n\nA fortnight earlier, Sindhu suffered a quarter-final exit at the Spain Masters in Madrid when she went down fighting to Thai sixth seed Supanida Katethong 24-26, 21-17, 22-20.\n\nFrustrated at not having pulled it off, second seed Sindhu smashed her racket on the court, perhaps for the first time in her career, to earn a yellow card from the chair umpire.\n\nSindhu had a good chance of ending her title drought – her last title came at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July 2022. But she fluffed her lines again through erratic play.\n\nNational coach Vimal Kumar believes Sindhi is a top player and has the wares to make a mark in Paris. But, at 28, her physical powers are certainly diminishing.\n\n“Sindhu has the net game but needs better shot selection and quicker reactions,” said Vimal.\n\nSindhu has pulled out of the Uber Cup, which will be held in Chengdu, China from April 28 to May 5, in a bid to better prepare for the Olympics.\n\nReuters\n\n“If I want to achieve something – and my aim is to achieve the Olympic gold – then I would do anything for it.”\n\nP.V.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe city of Raebareli in northern India has for most of the last 75 years been the political fiefdom of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that dominates the once-powerful Congress party and provided three of the nation’s prime ministers.\n\nBut, with India’s general election starting today, the party’s central offices there tell the story of its decline.\n\nClothes dried in the courtyard, while a washing machine beeped and a family living out of the office went about its morning chores. No other Congress workers were present.\n\n“Some people here say the end of the Gandhi era is now imminent,” said teacher K.C. Shukla, a Congress member who resides in the house where his relatives had set up a party office decades ago.\n\nRaebareli is one of just 17 constituencies being contested by the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is targeting a clean sweep of its 80 seats in the lower house of parliament.\n\nVirtually all opinion polls suggest Mr Modi’s Hindu nationalist party will return to power for a rare third term – and dominate in Uttar Pradesh – when results from the seven-phase elections are announced on June 4.\n\nNeither party has yet named its candidate for Raebareli, though both BJP and Congress officials said an announcement would be made soon.\n\nCongress members are clamouring for former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s daughter Priyanka Gandhi, 52, to make her electoral debut from Raebareli and her brother Rahul Gandhi, 53, from Amethi, another Nehru-Gandhi stronghold in Uttar Pradesh. But the party said on Tuesday an announcement will be made at the right time.\n\nMr Rahul kept up the suspense during a press conference on Tuesday and was non-committal when asked about who the party will field against the BJP’s Smriti Irani in Amethi for the election on May 20.\n\n“This is BJP’s question, very good. Whatever order I will get, I will follow it. In our party, all these (selections of candidates) decisions are taken by the Congress Election Committee,” Mr Gandhi said.\n\nAmethi, once a bastion of the Gandhi family, was won by the BJP in the 2019 elections. Speculation has been rife that Mr Rahul, who has already filed his nomination from Wayanad in Kerala, is not sure if he can win Amethi again – a seat represented earlier by his father, uncle Sanjay Gandhi and mother Sonia Gandhi.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, Ms Irani, a Union minister, unseated Mr Rahul, ending his 15-year reign in Amethi.\n\nOn April 12, Ms Irani criticised Mr Rahul for ignoring the people of Amethi and questioned his commitment to the constituency.\n\n“You all must have seen that Rahul Gandhi filed his nomination and declared in writing that Wayanad is his family. It was okay till there. Then we heard from a leader of Karnataka that Rahul Gandhi said the people of Wayanad are more loyal,” the BJP leader charged.\n\nThe Raebareli seat was represented by Ms Sonia, 77, Congress’ long-time president, from 2004 until she entered the upper house of parliament this year.\n\nTwenty-one lawmakers, party officials and analysts, including 13 members of the Congress, that Reuters interviewed said the party faces another big loss in Uttar Pradesh, and risks losing its status as India’s main opposition group as rival regional parties make gains elsewhere in the country.\n\nThey blamed lacklustre management by Ms Sonia and her son, and the family’s inability to rally the country’s fractured centre and centre-left opposition.\n\nWhen asked by Reuters at a campaign rally about his political future and opinion polls, Mr Rahul said: “My job is to spread political activism; results can never be predicted.”\n\nMr Jawaharlal Nehru – Mr Rahul’s great-grandfather – was India’s first prime minister and his Congress ruled India for 54 of the 76 years since independence. Mr Rahul’s grandfather, born Feroze Gandhy, changed his last name after being inspired by Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nMany Indians had an emotional connection with the Gandhi family, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai, the author of three books about the Congress and the clan.\n\nSuch was their influence that for decades “there were no factional leaders within the Congress,” he said, adding that a long-standing combination of fear and respect for the family had recently dwindled.\n\n“UP had given votes to four generations of Nehru-Gandhi family, today no one is listening to them in UP. It’s like the state has bid farewell to Nehru-Gandhi family, so it’s natural to be frustrated and disappointed,” Union Minister and BJP leader Anurag Thakur said a few weeks ago.\n\nMr Rahul continues to lead public rallies and his sister is a top party strategist. But the family looks set to preside over a third straight loss in national elections.\n\nMs Priyanka led the Congress to a humiliating defeat in the Uttar Pradesh state elections in 2022, harming the prestige of the Gandhi name, according to political analysts.\n\nMr Dinesh Singh, a minister in the BJP-run Uttar Pradesh government, told Reuters that his party’s main challengers in the state were two regional parties, including the BSP, who are contesting more than 40 seats.\n\nThe Gandhis “will be phased out completely,” he predicted of the upcoming elections.\n\nMr Pankaj Tiwari, a senior Congress leader in Raebareli, said that Priyanka -– who has never held elected office – would likely contest from Raebareli and “will win with a record high margin.”\n\nBut not many other Congress leaders are confident of the party doing well in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nReuters\n\n“UP had given votes to four generations of Nehru-Gandhi family, today no one is listening to them in UP.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe mention of kabaddi often leaves Britons scratching their heads, but a handful of players keen to develop the game in England have tried their best to explain the 4,000-year-old sport, well known to the country’s South Asian diaspora.\n\n“I always say it’s like team wrestling with tag,” England international Felix Li said.\n\nAs a modern version of the discipline from ancient India slowly expands its presence globally, a group of enthusiasts from various backgrounds have banded together to establish England as an emerging nation in the sport ahead of a World Cup next year.\n\nOrganised by the breakaway World Kabaddi Federation (WKF), the tournament in England will not feature national teams affiliated with its rival governing body, the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF).\n\nHowever, for many of the dozens of kabaddi players in England, it is still an opportunity. With little money and recognition on offer, these international players find the time to play the sport between their day jobs and other obligations.\n\nLi, a tech manager in a startup, and accountant Yuvraj Pandeya, quit their jobs to pursue their passion abroad – a move that paid off when they were signed by Dabang Delhi in the Indian Pro Kabaddi (PKL), the premier league in the sport.\n\n“Felix is doing a daily vlog where he’s basically sending all the skills that we’ve learnt back to the people in the UK,” Pandeya told Reuters.\n\nLi and Pandeya began training in India in November 2022 after England lost all their games in their debut campaign in the Bangabandhu Cup - an invitational tournament in Bangladesh.\r\r“The problem with kabaddi in UK is that we don’t have the coaches with the know-how,” England player Tom Dawtrey said. “We coach ourselves by watching videos, watching Pro Kabaddi.”\n\nLi, who comes from a family of Hong Kong origin, discovered kabaddi at Imperial College in London.\n\n“I’ve played rugby throughout school. That’s probably why I could make some catches in my first training session,” he said.\n\nDawtrey says there are a lot of transferable skills between the two sports.\n\n“Some of the tackles are pretty similar, as well as the agility and the strength combination,” he said.\n\nMost England internationals discovered the sport through tournaments organised by South Asian communities or while at university.\n\n“We got into the sport playing it as a hobby. In the UK, it’s still kind of a hobby,” Pandeya said.\n\nDawtrey said the players in England found it hard to improve due to a lack of tournaments.\n\nLi and Pandeya did not get any game time in Pro Kabaddi this season, but they said the Indian league had provided them with valuable experience.\n\nDawtrey said he is planning to quit his job in May and travel to India to train in an academy affiliated with Pro Kabaddi side UP Yoddha.\n\n“Sometimes you can’t deny your passion,” Dawtrey said. “Representing my country, taking selfies with fans and seeing their enthusiasm, it’s really validating as a player who’s travelled so far.”\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/990361c5cda3a484ee275fa7b4dc97fe684f74059663f46951a70b597534fd06?w=825", "alt_text": "George Wellington tackles a player during a Kabaddi match at the London School of Economics in London."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBritish-American author Salman Rushdie has spoken in chilling detail to the BBC about what he remembers of the near-fatal stabbing at a public event in 2022 that left him blind in one eye and his journey to healing.\n\nThe Booker Prize-winning author said his eye was left hanging down his face “like a soft-boiled egg”, and that losing the eye “upsets him every day”.\n\n“I remember thinking I was dying,” he said. “Fortunately, I was wrong.”\n\nRushdie said he is using his new book Knife, which hit stores on Tuesday, as a way of fighting back against what happened.\n\nThe attack took place at an education institute in New York state in August 2022, as he was preparing to give a lecture.\n\nHe recalled how the assailant came “sprinting up the stairs” and stabbed him 12 times, including in his neck and abdomen, in an attack lasting 27 seconds.\n\n“I couldn’t have fought him,” the author said. “I couldn’t have run away from him.”\n\nRushdie said he fell to the floor, where he lay with “a spectacular quantity of blood” all around him.\n\nHe was taken to a hospital by helicopter and spent six weeks recovering there.\n\nThe India-born author, 76, is one of the most influential writers of modern times. He previously spent several years in hiding after the 1988 publication of The Satanic Verses triggered threats against his life.\n\nHis fourth book’s depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and its references to religion were considered blasphemous and banned in multiple Muslim-majority countries.\n\nIran’s then-leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious decree in 1989 calling for Rushdie’s assassination and placing a US$3 million bounty on the author’s head. That fatwa has never been rescinded.\n\nAs a result, Rushdie was forced into hiding for nearly a decade and required an armed bodyguard due to the number of death threats he received.\n\nRushdie admitted in the BBC interview he had thought someone might “jump out of an audience” one day. “Clearly it would’ve been absurd for it not to cross my mind,” he said.\n\nThe attack damaged Rushdie’s liver and hands, and severed nerves in his right eye.\n\nHis eye looked “very distended, swollen,” he said. “It was kind of hanging out of my face, sitting on my cheek, I’ve said like a soft-boiled egg. And blind.”\n\nHe said losing one eye “upsets me every day”. He finds he has to take greater care when walking down stairs, or crossing a road, or even when pouring water into a glass.\n\nBut he considers himself lucky to have avoided brain damage. “It meant I was actually still able to be myself.”\n\nFor the first time, in Knife, Rushdie has revealed what he would like to say to his alleged attacker.\n\nHadi Matar, a 26-year-old New Jersey resident, has been charged with stabbing him. Matar has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post from jail, Matar said he had watched videos of Rushdie on YouTube. “I don’t like people who are disingenuous like that,” Matar said.\n\nIn Knife, Rushdie has an imaginary conversation with his attacker, in which he responds to that.\n\n“In America, many people pretend to be honest, but they wear masks and lie. And would that be a reason to kill them all?” he asks.\n\nRushdie has never met Matar. But he is likely to come face to face with him in court when the trial gets under way.\n\nThe trial was delayed after lawyers for the defendant argued they were entitled to review Rushdie’s book, as it could be evidence. It’s now expected to take place in August.\n\nRushdie said he will do public events again, but he will be “more careful” in future. “The security question is going to be the first question. Unless I’m satisfied about that, I’m not going to do it.”\n\nBut he added, he is “a pretty obstinate person”.\n\n“I don’t want some restricted or confined life,” he said. “I’m going to have my life.”\n\n“It was kind of hanging out of my face, sitting on my cheek, I’ve said like a soft-boiled egg. And blind.”\n\nSalman Rushdie (left) on being stabbed and losing his right eye", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2fb005c138b3aec0ab8d7cf2661763409205760dc3e313fd48f9ac9ab0162c42?w=825", "alt_text": "British-US author Salman Rushdie, who released his memoir Knife on April 16, 2024."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndian folk singer Maithili Thakur thought she was successful, with millions following her on social media for her Hindu devotional tunes. But then India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent her popularity soaring into the stratosphere.\n\nWith India’s marathon general election set to start on April 19, critics say Mr Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has co-opted the vast youth fan bases of hugely influential social media stars – in fields ranging from music to culture and fashion to fitness – to push its political message.\n\nMs Thakur was among 24 influencers handed prizes in March at the first government-organised National Creators Award to promote “storytellers of a confident, assertive New India”.\n\nMany of the social media stars were strikingly similar in their promotion of India’s Hindu-majority culture, and several backed the BJP’s ideology.\n\n“There are many influencers who are collaborating with the current ruling government and making videos,” said Ms Thakur, who has 14 million followers on Facebook and more than 4.5 million each on Instagram and YouTube.\n\nBut critics say the chance to maximise their follower numbers and income from social posts by collaborating with the BJP may encourage influencers to uncritically back the ruling party, which is widely expected to win.\n\nMs Thakur, 23, already a popular reality TV star for her classical singing, got even more attention when Mr Modi shared her devotional song on X during the inauguration of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya in January.\n\n“So much buzz was created,” said Ms Thakur, who was named Cultural Ambassador of the Year at the National Creators Award, where she shared videos of meeting Mr Modi.\n\nThe close ties between the Indian government and social media stars worry Mr Prateek Waghre, from digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation.\n\n“There is enough to be concerned about just by the nature of these collaborations,” said Mr Waghre, noting that influencers want to earn money from their posts and win new followers.\n\n“Purely on the question of incentives, you can see how this will skew them to engage in discourse that’s overwhelmingly positive, or at least non-critical.”\n\nWhile political parties across the board use social media, critics see the Indian government’s links with influencers as part of a sophisticated soft-power campaign policy by the BJP.\n\nMr Waghre said he also fears the offers of cash or attention could woo influencers to back a party “irrespective of their own political beliefs”.\n\nWith over half of India’s 1.4 billion people aged under 30, according to government health figures, using social media is a “tactic” to reach out to young voters, Ms Thakur added.\n\nThe Indian government’s online platform, MyGov, also carried interviews with prize-winning influencers praising Mr Modi.\n\nIndia’s 462 million YouTube users are the platform’s largest audience by country, according to market tracker Statista.\n\n“By approaching the youth, you are trying to influence the major population of India,” said Ms Thakur, speaking to AFP from a room in her New Delhi home, which she uses as a recording studio, its walls adorned with colourful traditional paintings.\n\nBut Ms Thakur has also been appointed as an election commission ambassador, which means she can only encourage people to take part in polls, not promote a party.\n\nOthers are more direct.\n\nEx-wrestler Ankit Baiyanpuria, winner of the national fitness creator award, urged his eight million Instagram fans to vote for Mr Modi’s BJP.\n\nBJP stalwarts, including India’s Trade Minister Piyush Goyal and India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, have featured on YouTuber’s Ranveer Allahbadia’s channels – with the videos tagged “Collaboration with @MyGov”.\n\nMs Janhvi Singh, 20, who makes posts on culture and religion – from explaining Hindu scriptures to showcasing traditional dress – was given the Heritage Fashion Icon Award.\n\nShe called her collaboration with the Indian government an “opportunity”, and said she valued the BJP’s focus on Hinduism because she feared India was “forgetting our roots and culture”.\n\nShe noted that she did not directly tell her followers who to vote for.\n\n“I don’t share any such political views on social media openly,” she said. “But I think it is important to spread this message that you should vote.”\n\nBut she was clear her loyalties lay with Mr Modi.\n\n“I think there is no other leader who is doing good for the country,” she said.\n\nAFP\n\n“By approaching the youth, you are trying to influence the major population of India.”\n\nIndian folk singer Maithili Thakur (left) on close ties between the Indian government and social media influencers", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f57fe4d8625943ae30aec6a9db4876f4563f79b3607fc2a29b4fb2b11660aef2?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTwo fast bowlers has stood out over the last few years in the Indian Premier League (IPL) because of their speed.\n\nOne is Umran Malik, from Jammu and Kashmir, who notched a top speed of 157kmh in 2022, before regularly bowling at 150kmh and above.\n\nThe other is Delhi lad Mayank Yadav, who has created a storm in this year’s tournament.\n\nThe 21-year-old, while making his debut for Lucknow Super Giants against Punjab Kings last month, bowled a ball at 155.8kmh.\n\nIn the next game against Royal Challengers Bangalore, he went one better with a 156.7kmh scorcher – the season’s quickest delivery.\n\nWhat was even more telling was that he picked up six wickets for 41 runs across the two matches, and took home both the man of the match awards.\n\nWatching his performance, former West Indies bowler and commentator Ian Bishop called him a “child of the wind”.\n\nDale Steyn, one of the greatest fast bowlers in history and who Mayank described as his idol, said on Twitter: “Mayank Yadav where have you been hiding!”\n\nFormer Australia player Tom Moody felt Yadav was “definitely in the conversation” to make India’s squad for the T20 World Cup in June.\n\nMany bowlers have topped 150kmh in the IPL. Australian Shaun Tait tops the list with 157.7kmh, followed by New Zealand’s Lockie Ferguson (157.3kmh) and Malik (157kmh). Mayank is in fourth spot.\n\nBut what has made many experts gush over Mayank’s performances is his accuracy and control. He hasn’t yet bowled a single extra in the IPL. He has varied his lengths without pace being affected.\n\nAnd he has prised out some high-quality batters.\n\nAgainst Punjab, he accounted for Englishman Jonny Bairstow, one of the more accomplished players of fast bowling, by hurrying him on the pull shot.\n\nHe similarly dismissed Bangalore’s Glenn Maxwell, one of the best T20 batters in the world, and also uprooted Australian star Cameron Green’s off-stump.\n\n“He has some real extra speed that you don’t really see a lot of around world cricket at the moment,” Maxwell told ESPN.\n\nUsually, the faster a bowler bowls, the harder it is for them to maintain control. Tait and Malik both suffered from that. Mayank has defied the stereotype.\n\nBut there are other pitfalls, such as injuries.\n\nIn his third match against Gujarat Titans, Mayank bowled just one over, clocking near 140kmh, before leaving the field with an abdominal strain – which proves just how difficult it is to bowl continuously at a high pace.\n\nMalik played 10 one-day internationals and eight T20I internationals for India in 2022 and 2023, but cannot currently command a guaranteed place in the first XI of his franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad. His pace has diminished and he is prone to injuries.\n\nMayank already missed last year’s IPL due to injury, and the Lucknow team’s physios worked hard to get him fit for this season.\n\n“He’s quietly, patiently waited for two seasons in the dugout,” said Lucknow captain K.L. Rahul.\n\n“He understands that bowling 155kmh is not easy, and he’s had a few injuries. But he’s professional in looking after his body and he has a great temperament.”\n\nIt’s still early days for Mayank. But, if he can stay fit, he could very well make the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies in June.\n\nFormer Indian chairman of selectors M.S.K, Prasad, for one, believes Mayank is an ideal replacement for the injured Mohammed Shami.\n\n“Mayank has shown that he can absorb pressure and bowl consistently at a good line and has already troubled the best of the lot with his pace,” Prasad told RevSportz.\n\n“If they are not able to bring the bat down against the pace he has been generating, I think he will be handy.”\n\n“He has some real extra speed that you don’t really see a lot of around world cricket at the moment.”\n\nGlenn Maxwell on Lucknow Super Giants’ bowler Mayank Yadav (left)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0129a1afef23223376bf85da53e9bd80dbe57014cbf1e6b606b77ce4b70d3ec6?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA Bollywood film about young Indian women recruited by the Islamic State has sparked renewed controversy ahead of India’s parliamentary elections, with the opposition saying its screening on national TV could “sow seeds of religious animosity”.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to win the multi-phase national elections that begin on April 19, partly thanks to his consistent wooing of the majority Hindu community as well as to strong economic growth and handouts.\n\nThe BJP has also fielded many actors in the elections, votes from which will be counted on June 4.\n\nBut Bollywood’s involvement in the election took a complicated turn on April 5 when The Kerala Story, set in Kerala that is run by a Left-led coalition, was aired on government-owned national broadcaster Doordarshan.\n\nThe small-budget movie, a surprise hit since its release last summer, follows three women who are indoctrinated and convert to Islam from Hinduism and are then sent to Islamic State camps in Afghanistan.\n\nCritics say the film incites negative sentiments against India’s minority Muslim community.\n\nAs Doordarshan is free for consumers, the channel reaches many homes across the country.\n\n“Doordarshan is not an agency to undertake communal campaigns for BJP candidates,” Kerala’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.\n\n“Secular Kerala will stand united in resisting such subversive attempts aimed at fostering communal discord.”\n\nThe main opposition Congress party also spoke out against the airing.\n\nThe Youth Congress staged a protest march to the Doordarshan office in Thiruvananthapuram on April 5.\n\nEarlier that day, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Congress lodged separate complaints with the Election Commission of India against Doordrashan’s decision to air the movie, urging it to intervene and stop the screening.\n\nLater, the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the youth wing of the Communist Party of India, screened a video, “The Kerala Story True or Fake?” by YouTuber Dhruv Rathee at various places across the state to debunk the movie.\n\nA BJP minister said the screening had nothing to do with politics.\n\n“A movie is a piece of art, and the expression of art is guaranteed in the constitution,” said Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan, who is also from Kerala.\n\nA BJP leader on Monday praised the screening of The Kerala Story at a church in Kerala, saying that the controversial film is “getting more and more support” in the state.\n\nThe film was screened on Sunday at the church run by the Idukki Diocese as part of a faith festival for Catechism students in classes 10, 11 and 12.\n\nThe church also issued a booklet on “love”, highlighting the threats of “love jihad”.\n\n“Love jihad” is a phrase popularised by Hindutva organisations to denote the relationship between a Muslim man and a non-Muslim woman where the Muslim partner wishes to convert the non-Muslim.\n\nState BJP chief K. Surendran said that people in Kerala have “wholeheartedly welcomed the film”.\n\n“People have watched the film together because this is a real issue. Love jihad in Kerala has occurred many times and in many districts, including Kannur. There are hundreds of victims and cases in Kerala,” he said.\n\nLast year, the Kerala High Court refused to stop the release of the film, stating that the trailer did not contain anything offensive to any particular community.\n\nThe trailer was challenged before the court after it received widespread backlash for “falsely” claiming that 32,000 women from Kerala were converted and radicalised and deployed in terror missions both in India and abroad.\n\nThe BJP has little presence in most southern Indian states like Kerala, but is keen to win more seats there in its bid to secure more than 400 seats for its coalition, out of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament.\n\nThe movie, which Mr Modi has praised publicly, is among a string of Hindi-language films released since last year and which have appealed to BJP’s nationalist base.\n\nIn the run-up to the elections, several nationalistic films, including a biopic on Hindu ideologue Vinayak Savarkar, have been released in theatres this year.\n\n“Things are changing,” Randeep Hooda, who directed and acted in the Savarkar biopic, told Reuters.\n\n“It’s a different country; these are different times and therefore there are different movies being made. Nationalistic films have done well in the past.”\n\nAnother film, The Sabarmati Report, focuses on an incident where a suspected Muslim mob set fire to a train carrying Hindu pilgrims in Gujarat in 2002, sparking one of India’s worst religious riots since independence.\n\nIt will be released in May, in the middle of the nationwide voting period.\n\nReuters\n\n“Secular Kerala will stand united in resisting such subversive attempts aimed at fostering communal discord.”\n\nKerala’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a41ced93db8fc5aa89b2cc7dc4cde683ef996007df11cabb23fc583c43c162d1?w=825", "alt_text": "People riding past a poster of The Kerala Story outside a cinema in Mumbai."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nResidents in Mountbatten were treated to a four-hour programme of Indian culture and traditions during the Indian New Year celebrations at Katong Community Centre on April 6.\n\nOrganised by the community club’s Indian Activity Executive Committee (IAEC), the Flavours of India event involved  music, dance, fashion and food.\n\nIt was a learning occasion for non-Indians while the different Indian communities gathered to celebrate the Solar New Year.\n\nThe Solar calendar is believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent some 3,500 years ago.\n\nBased on it, communities in Singapore, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and southern China usher in the Solar New Year between April 13 and 16 every year. It is the first day of the solar cycle year, when the sun transits from Pisces to Aries.\n\nThe festivals associated with the Solar New Year include Tamil Puthandu (April 14), Punjabi Vaisakhi (April 13), Assamese Rongali Bihu (April 14-20), The Telugu and Kannada Ugadi (April 9) Malayalee Vishu (April 14), Bengali Pohela Boishakh (April 14), Thai Songkran (April 13-15) and Myanmarese Thingyan (April 13-16).\n\nTwenty-two Indian associations participated in the new year celebrations. These included the Kashmir Association, Northeast Indian Association of Singapore, Maharashtra Mandal Singapore, Singapore Malayalee Association, Meyer Tamil Sangam, Bengali Association Singapore, Singapore Indian Development Association and Indian Women’s Association.\n\nMore than 500 residents and guests enjoyed the performances, which included dances and songs from different Indian states and regions.\n\n“Mountbatten CC is uniquely positioned to organise such an extravagant event because people from all Indian states reside in the area,” said Mr S. Venkita Padmanabhan, vice-chairman, Mountbatten IAEC.\n\n“Last year, our celebrations were focused on giving the residents a taste of the different crafts from the Indian states. This year, the main intention was to give them a taste of the cuisines from the various regions of India.”\n\nTo that end, there were items such as momo, thukpa and phagshapa, which are popular in Sikkim; rabri, khadi and arsa, particular to Uttarakhand; Kashmiri traditional drink kehwa; and pazham pori and payasam from Kerala.\n\n“I was very surprised to see that the momos are similar to the dumplings in our Chinese culture,” said Ms Tricia Lee, a resident.\n\n“The food from the different parts of India tasted wonderful. The event opened my eyes to what Indian culture is all about and widened my perspective of the country’s traditions.”\n\nMs Lily Teo, 55, another resident, said: “There were different dances and a unique fashion show. I got to know a lot about the rich cultural heritage of India.”\n\nMountbatten IAEC’s chairperson Aarti Naidu said the programme was carefully put together after considerable deliberations.\n\n“We did not want it to be all about Bollywood and film music,” she said. “Each Indian state has its own culture and traditions, all of which most Indians living in Singapore have not experienced because usually they visit only the places they are connected to.\n\n“Our idea was to bring the different Indian communities in Singapore together and give people a chance to know and learn about what each Indian state has to offer.”\n\nThe music segment, titled Songs of Swadesh, and performed by Ambar Ghosh and his group Artist to Artist, was a medley of traditional Indian songs which made many residents and guests take to the floor. The dances too were of a wide variety, ranging from kathak to kuchipudi.\n\nThe grand finale was a ramp walk by members of the all-women Kamala Club, which was established in 1950.\n\nResidents too joined in the showcasing of ethnic weaves from all the 28 Indian states, ranging from Kashmir to Kerala.\n\n“One of the participants dressed as Chola warrior princess Kundavai, while another wore a dress from the Hmar community in Manipur,” said Kamala Club’s president Padmaja Yerramsetty.\n\n“We also had Malay and Chinese friends volunteering to wear saris that had Kashmir’s kashida embroidery, Kerala’s kasvau (fine threads of gold or silver used in handloom weaves), Bengal’s jamdani (a fine muslin on which decorative motifs are woven using a loom) and Gujarat’s arjak (designs made using block printing).”\n\nGuest-of-honour Lim Biow Chuan, MP and adviser to Mountbatten GROs, was impressed.\n\n“It is important to celebrate the Indian New Year because we are in a multiracial country,” he said.\n\n“Our IAEC invited different Indian societies to showcase their tradition, culture, food and dances. Many of the Chinese residents also came to learn more about the rich cultural heritage of India.\n\n“It was a good opportunity to build racial harmony among our different races.”\n\nThe Kashmir Association’s Pramila Gurtoo said the grassroots event “gave our community a platform to showcase our culture in front of a broader and diverse audience”.\n\n“For many people this was the first time they heard about our community, and we are glad we were able to make our presence visible along with other communities in an impactful manner,” she said.\n\n“The biggest benefices of these events are the youth and kids who get a first-hand view of other communities, grow appreciation for their roots and learn to co-exist in our multicultural society.”\n\nThe Uttarakhand Association of Singapore’s president Harish Pant said: “We not only celebrated the spirit of unity in diversity but also promoted cultural understanding and appreciation among all attendees.\n\n“Through our participation, we aimed to contribute to the vibrant tapestry of Singapore’s multicultural society, fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity among all.”\n\nMr Lim Biow Chuan, Member of Parliament for Mountbatten SMC, with members of the Gujarati community; (below) residents getting to taste traditional Indian food.\n\nPHOTOS: Mountbatten CC,  limbiowchuan/Facebook\n\n“Each Indian state has its own culture and traditions, all of which most Indians living in Singapore have not experienced because usually they visit only the places they are connected to.”\n\nMountbatten IAEC’s chairperson Aarti Naidu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b6cad6da77dcc069c1b3c75f833c5598f13beb788b24885f0a3ab8149c1d1fab?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Member of Parliament for Mountbatten SMC, with members of the Gujarati community; (below) residents getting to taste traditional Indian food."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAmazon’s celebrated Just Walk Out technology, which allowed customers to bypass traditional checkouts at its stores, secretly relied on Indian workers manually doing the job, according to a recent report in Business Insider.\n\nAbout 1,000 workers in India were tasked with reviewing what customers picked up and ultimately walked out with from Amazon’s Just Walk Out-enabled stores, the report said.\n\nWhile Amazon touted the technology as a groundbreaking achievement driven entirely by computer vision, the reality was that a significant portion of Just Walk Out sales required manual review by the team in India.\n\nThe report stated that in 2022, around 700 out of every 1,000 Just Walk Out transactions had to be verified by these workers, citing an unnamed source familiar with the technology.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson disputed this claim, asserting that the India-based team primarily assisted in training the model used for Just Walk Out.\n\n“Amazon does have people to annotate video images, which is necessary for continuously improving the underlying machine learning model powering Just Walk Out technology,” the spokesperson said, as quoted by Business Insider.\n\n“Associates may also validate a small minority of shopping visits where our computer vision technology cannot determine with complete confidence an individual’s purchases.”\n\nThe revelation comes as Amazon plans to phase out Just Walk Out technology at its Amazon Fresh stores in favour of its Dash Carts, according to media outlet The Information.\n\nThese smart shopping carts will allow customers to avoid checkout lines by automatically tracking and charging for their selections, providing an alternative to the Just Walk Out experience.\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson explained the motivation behind the transition, stating that customers desired additional features like easily locating nearby products and deals, viewing their receipts while shopping, and knowing their savings – capabilities offered by the Dash Carts.\n\nJust Walk Out technology first debuted in Amazon Go convenience stores. It enabled customers to enter by identifying themselves with their Amazon account, pick up items, return items to shelves, and walk out with their final selections without interacting with a cashier.\n\nAmazon had referred to Just Walk Out as “a combination of sophisticated tools and technologies that added items to the shopper’s virtual cart when they take an item off a shelf, and remove it when they put it back”.\n\nAccording to its site, by adding the technology, it wasn’t removing employees – only “shifting” the way they spend their time by assisting customers, stocking shelves and answering questions.\n\nWhen it released the technology, Amazon claimed it was “a combination of computer vision, object recognition, advanced sensors, deep machine learning models and generative AI”.\n\nThe Just Walk Out feature is being discontinued in all 27 of the company’s stores that house the technology.\n\nCustomers have previously complained about Just Walk Out, saying they were charged incorrectly and it took hours after leaving the store to receive their receipt.\n\nSome shoppers were also concerned that the company was using shopper’s biometric data despite assurances by Mr Jon Jenkins, the vice-president of Just Walk Out, that the technology doesn’t collect or use biometric information.\n\nAmazon had previously been accused of not informing customers that it was using its cameras and sensors to measure the shape and size of each person’s body as they entered the store.\n\nThe biometric data was reportedly used for identifying and tracking purposes and led to a New York class action lawsuit by customers who said Amazon violated the state’s Biometric Identifier Information Law.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b5077deb999df7a029697ca70ca73d1a86ed41d7458179717dfee8b1030f277b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Its businesses span over 15 countries and its products reach consumers in about 100 countries.\n\nBut it is in Nigeria, where it has built West Africa’s largest deep water port and free trade zone, that the company has its deepest foothold.\n\nLocated 60km east of Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos, on an 850ha site, the Lagos Free Zone is the country’s first privately owned special economic zone, with a fully integrated deep-sea port, and has attracted cumulative investments of over $2.5 billion to date.\n\nDesigned by Singapore’s Surbana Jurong and built in partnership with China Harbour Engineering Company, the industrial park when fully occupied will host more than 100 businesses engaged in various sectors of manufacturing, commercial real estate, and logistics and supply chain management. The facility generates its own power and has ready-to-lease factories, residential complexes, medical facilities, transport depots and warehousing facilities.\n\nMore than a dozen companies have moved in, including BASF, Tata International, Kelloggs, Arla, Dufil Prima Foods and Colgate-Palmolive.\n\nThe Lekki port, with a draft depth of 16.5m, is the deepest sea port in Nigeria today and designed to handle ships carrying up to 18,000 standard shipping containers. Since its opening last year, the port has employed around 20,000 people.\n\n“The free zone and ports are a game changer,” says Mr Haresh, who adds that the port’s aggregate impact on the Nigerian economy over a 45-year concession period will be around US$360 billion ($485 billion).\n\n“Africa has huge potential for double-digit growth, and Nigeria is the largest country in the continent both by GDP and by population (218.5 million). There are a lot of companies that want to tap into the market but can’t because of a lack of infrastructure. The port and the free zone change all that, to the point that the country becomes a manufacturing hub; because it has all the ingredients – land, agriculture, gas, energy sources, a young workforce.\n\n“The port is going to be as efficient as ports in Dubai, Shanghai or Singapore. But we will take some time to ramp up our efficiency to get there.”\n\nTolaram already had a presence in Africa in the mid 1980s when Mr Haresh joined the company. Under his watch, the firm introduced instant noodles to African consumers, an undertaking that involved “changing the dietary habits of Africans”, so to speak.\n\nIt wasn’t easy at first. The Indomie venture made a loss between 1996 and 2001. But thanks to savvy consumer education – “people in Africa were used to eating with their hands and didn’t know how to eat noodles,” explains Mr Haresh – by 2002, the product had become a hit with Nigerians. Soon, it caught on with other countries in the region, including Ghana, Kenya and Egypt.\n\nThe company then inked several big joint ventures, including with American cereal giant Kellogg’s, Danish dairy producer Arla and consumer-product giant Colgate-Palmolive.\n\nBorn in Indonesia and raised in Malaysia, Mr Aswani has been a Singapore citizen since 2004, and has served as the Republic’s honorary consul-general to Nigeria since 2006.\n\nAfter accomplishing so much for and in Nigeria, I ask if he has the country’s leaders on speed dial.\n\n“They keep changing their numbers,” he replies in jest. “But I’m sure they have my number on (theirs).”\n\nBut why Nigeria, a land with an unfortunate reputation for corruption, and included among the countries with the least peace in the world, according to the Global Peace Index?\n\n“It’s about believing in the country,” Mr Haresh explains. “There’s so much to learn in that part of the world, it’s a pity that many Singapore companies don’t see it.\n\n“The problem is perception, they fear Africa. They see the headlines, they panic. But we do in excess of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in business per annum. That’s the scope.\n\n“We actually went through a cycle; We were doing well at first and then we had an issue when the country stopped all payments and began issuing promissory notes. That made a lot of companies go bust, foreign ones especially. But we survived that.\n\n“You must look at Africa as a long-term game. That’s how we look at Nigeria. And if you can survive in Nigeria, you can do business anywhere in Africa.”\n\nMr Haresh Aswani with then-Nigerian Prime Minister Muhammadu Buhari during a visit to Nigeria in March 2022.\n\nPhotos: Sundara Nataraaj, Tolaram Group\n\n“The problem is perception, they fear Africa.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMalaysian S. Sivasangari (right) became the first player from the country to win a Professional Squash Association World Tour gold-level final since Nicol David in 2015.\n\nThe seventh seed outlasted world No. 2 Egyptian Hania El Hammamy 11-9, 5-11, 13-11, 12-14, 11-8 in Sunday’s London Squash Classic final at Alexandra Palace to cap an outstanding tournament, reported The Star.\n\nThe 25-year-old had earlier defeated world No. 1 and seven-time world champion Nour El Sherbini of Egypt in the quarter-final and world No. 4 Nele Gilis of Belgium in the semi-final.\n\n“Proud of the squash I played this week in this beautiful venue and over the moon to capture my biggest title yet!,” Sivasangari said on X. “Massive thanks to my team for always trusting in me along the way.”\n\nShe also told Twentytwo13: “Beating these top players back-to-back in one tournament was a real test for me, and I did it.\n\n“I dedicate this win to my family, my coaches (David Palmer and Ajaz Azmat), my mental training and strength trainer and all my supporters in Malaysia. A huge thank you to my sponsors for always believing in me.”\n\nIt has been a remarkable two years of recovery for Sivasangari, who has bounced back from a near career-ending car accident in June 2022. She sustained fractures on her face but more frighteningly a fracture of her C1 vertebra. The injuries meant she had to pull out of the Commonwealth Games that year.\n\nFor two months, she wore a neck collar and often needed her mother to give her a bath.\n\nWith her victory on Sunday, she has reached her highest world ranking – 13th.\n\nHer sensational run in London was hailed across Malaysia, with eight-time world champion Nicol egging on the youngster to go after her dreams.\n\n“I watched her match (against El Hammamy) and she was amazing,” Nicol said. “She’s got a lot of squash sense and her awareness on the court is immaculate.”\n\nNicol thinks that Sivasangari can go a long way in the sport and emulate even her own staggering achievements.\n\n“She can go as far as she wants to, and all we have to do is to encourage,” said Nicol, who won the Asian Squash Championship a record nine times and is considered one of the greatest female squash players ever.\n\nSivasangari, who won the Asian Games individual and team titles in 2022, will now look to crack the top 10 and be more consistent on the world tour.\n\n“The win is a big confidence booster. Beating these top players is not a one-day job. I have put in a lot of work for the past couple of years,” Sivasangari told The Star.\n\n“I will keep working harder to achieve more of my goals, including the Olympics.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/14ac4f359834e45493ed7c2d7bb6019bea6d0ea29b8844a53f70ae28b05895f9?w=825", "alt_text": "PHOTO: HANGZHOU ASIAN GAMES"}]}

The deities I pray to must be satisfied with what I am offering to them,” said Mr Shakthi, 43, who prays twice a day and considers dhoop cones as “god’s perfume”.\n\n“I did not get the satisfaction when using the instant dhoop cones; they defeated the purpose of creating a divine atmosphere. They also caused eye irritation and I could not even smell the fragrance.”\n\nAfter finding that the dhoop cones sold in Singapore weren’t up to the mark, Mr Shakthi scouted Malaysia for better versions of the product – but that too proved in vain.\n\n“That’s when I decided, why not make my own dhoop cones?”\n\n“Purely natural dhoop cones are made from tree sap and are broken down easily, unlike the instant ones. The dhoop cones found in stores are mass-produced and packaged using binding ingredients like resins, which are highly hazardous,” he told tabla!\n\nMr Shakthi, previously an event coordinator at The Esplanade with no working experience in a laboratory, conducted numerous trials before concocting the right recipe.\n\nResearching various alchemy websites on the manufacturing process of perfume, he first tried soaking a store-bought milk dhoop cone in liquid perfume. One time, he even used his Hugo Boss perfume in a trial run. It didn’t pan out.\n\nThen he tried soaking the dhoop cone in oil-based perfumes, but that failed as well.\n\nMr Shakthi then bought sandalwood powder and mixed it with a crushed milk dhoop cone. When he burnt it, he found the fragrance was close to ideal.\n\nHe later tried the same experiment using sandalwood sticks. This time, he met the mark.\n\n“Dhoop cones come in different scents like rose, lavender, marjoram and neem. But, I have never seen or bought any dhoop cones in sandalwood flavour,” he said.\n\n“Sandalwood is actually a popular ingredient used during prayer rituals at temples. So I gave it a try. Sandalwood sticks, together with crushed milk dhoop cone turned out to be the perfect recipe.\n\nBut, I had to also make sure that I invested in high-grade sandalwood sticks and fully natural dhoop cones.”\n\nArmed with the recipe for success, Mr Shakthi roped in a friend to import high-grade sandalwood sticks. He also procured a small central kitchen space and employed workers to help him with the dhoop cone-making process.\n\nCalling his creations “Shakthi Sambrani”, he introduced his product on his Facebook page, handing out free samples to those who supported his efforts.\n\n“Some of them encouraged me to start a business – and that was how Shakthi Sambrani was born,” said Mr Shakthi, who provides dhoop cones in other scents such as lavender, neem and marjoram. He also customises his dhoop cones according to his customers’ preferences.\n\nAnd for customers who still prefer instant dhoop cones, he sells authentic ones made from pure charcoal.\n\nMs Priya, 37, a customer of Shakthi Sambrani, said: “I used to get instant dhoop cones from shops in Singapore and Malaysia. After trying Shakthi’s dhoop cones, I have not returned to instant dhoop cones.”\n\n“I did not get the satisfaction when using the instant dhoop cones; they defeated the purpose of creating a divine atmosphere.”\n\nMr Shakthi Mogan (above) with a dhoop cone he made from scratch.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6092c76d60e7050611f27418cb63916f278c01110497e64f8f9e21d12ca78f22?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Shakthi Mogan with a dhoop cone he made from scratch."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe weathermen may be saying it is 34 deg C, but it feels like being in a red-hot oven. What’s scarier: the mercury level is expected to rise even higher.\n\nWhile many of us can find shelter in the shade and move about in air-conditioned vehicles, we should spare a thought for those toiling outdoors in the sweltering heat.\n\nKudos to the Ministry of Manpower for implementing enhanced measures to reduce the risks of heat stress for these workers.\n\nHowever, it is still up to the individual to be smart and cool.\n\nBesides the usual drill – remain hydrated by drinking lots of water and not going out when the sun is at its hottest – here are other ways to stay cool.\n\nAfter a trip outdoors, cool your pulse points by running cold water or rubbing ice cubes over your wrists.\n\nIf that does not do the trick, place a cold cloth or a cold pack on the back of your neck for five minutes.\n\nDon’t try it with a chilled can of beer. You may be tempted to crack it open to quench your thirst.\n\nThe rule is to stay clear of alcohol as it can dehydrate you.\n\nWearing a hat is also advisable as it provides instant shade and reduces your exposure to the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.\n\nSurprisingly, Singaporeans are not into hats and caps despite the island being smack on the equator.\n\nAnother item that could become popular is the portable fan. Once, people would look askance at these gadgets, but now it is common to see commuters with small portable fans at bus stops and MRT stations.\n\nThe next tip might not go down well with food-obsessed Singaporeans: Eat small meals since digestion of a hearty meal can significantly raise the body’s core temperature.\n\nThe Straits Times recently reported that a pilot study by Nanyang Technological University showed that heat reflective paint can cool buildings by up to 2 deg C. Let’s hope this technology can be applied to fabrics in the near future, so we can look and feel cool every time.\n\nUntil then, stick to loose, light-coloured attire spun from cotton or linen, and avoid body-hugging outfits in dark colours.\n\nHot, sweaty, fashionable hues or cool, comfortable, dowdy tints?

So, when The New Paper was launched in 1988, he came to Singapore to work for it, leaving behind his wife and newborn son.\n\nIt was difficult living alone, but he fell in love with Singapore and forged a career here, including a brief stint with The Straits Times.\n\n“I loved my job and the place,” said the 71-year-old, who is now retired. “So, I didn’t want to leave Singapore.  I spoke to my wife and son almost every day, as for several years we lived apart – my wife in India, I in Singapore and our son in America, where he went to college on a scholarship.\n\n“It was not easy being far away from my family. But, overall, Singapore gave me what I wanted and much more.”\n\nThe 200-page autobiography details Abhijit’s life and career here.\n\nHe earned more money and was able to meet the expenses of his son who went for higher studies to the US. He could also use the English language, which he dearly loves, more often than in Kolkata, from where he hailed.\n\n“I’ve made a few good friends, not all of whom speak my mother tongue Bengali,” he said.\n\n“I like Singapore’s multi-racialism, and it exposed me to a foreign culture I would have never experienced if I remained in Kolkata.\n\n“I love the greenery, peace and quiet of my neighbourhood (Bishan) and the National Library and its branches. Thanks to it, I could read leading newspapers from around the world, magazines and its good collection of books. These are facilities I didn’t have in Kolkata.”\n\nAbhijit’s passion is working with words, and The New Paper offered him an avenue for that. He started as a sub-editor and then became a copy editor who wrote the occasional column.\n\nIn the book, he writes about his time at the tabloid, where he made several friends, many of whom were from different countries. “I still fondly remember some of my colleagues. They were wonderful,” he said.\n\nHe also mentions how the paper changed course over the years, preferring to replace copy editors and sub-editors with local talent.\n\n“In the end, I had to leave in grief, as I had to accept voluntary retirement,” he said. “So, I have regrets. But time is a great healer.\n\n“Would I have been better off as a journalist in India? I don’t know. But I have no regrets about coming to Singapore. I love Singapore.”\n\nAbhijit’s wife eventually joined him in 2013 after she retired as the teacher-in-charge of her college. And he decided to write the book after she recovered from multi-organ failure and spine surgery and his son got married in 2016.\n\n“I was already in my 60s, given to nostalgia and had time on my hands. If I wanted to write, it was now or never,” said Abhijit, who previously edited a book called Inspirations Of A Nation: Tribute To 25 Singaporean South Asians.\n\n“Another reason I wrote was to recall all the idols and objects – vinyl discs, typewriters, tramcars – that were part of our lives.\n\n“I also wrote it because I love reading the memoirs of journalists. I loved reading Mother Teresa’s biographer Malcolm Muggeridge’s memoirs Chronicles Of Wasted Time, where he wrote about working for The Statesman in Kolkata, a newspaper where I had also worked; the famous editor Harold Evans’ autobiography My Paper Chase; and Carl Bernstein’s memoirs Chasing History.\n\n“Interestingly, Bernstein doesn’t write about how he and Bob Woodward brought down President Nixon by exposing the Watergate scandal. He writes about his younger days working for the Washington Star, which no longer exists.\n\n“I dwell on the past, too. I recall working for the Statesman in the 1970s when we didn’t work on computers. I look back fondly on The New Paper, too.”\n\nThese days Abhijit and his wife divide their time between Singapore – they live in Bishan – and Kolkata.\n\nPublished by Authors Press, Indian Heartstrings Singapore Serenade is available for $25 at Amazon India.\n\nFormer TNP copy editor Abhijit Nag.\n\nPhoto: Abhijit Nag", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e05733e4e6022b6e7df3b93d5263780edc6623b547b7e4d68999801f0aa201a3?w=825", "alt_text": "Former TNP copy editor Abhijit Nag."}]}

Nathan, who is also a former editor of the Indian Movie News magazine, said Mr Hardial’s legacy remains influential within the Indian community.\n\n“Our community still benefits from Mr Hardial’s hard work and charitable nature. It is due to his efforts that we have a building (Indian Association in Balestier Road) for all Indians, regardless of linguistic or religious identity,” he said. “It was, and still is, an association for Indians to join without needing any other identity marker.”\n\nThe IHFS, established in 2019, recognises Singapore Indians who have made significant contributions across various fields. To date, the council has held three rounds of selections for its hall of fame, inducting 120 people.\n\nThe inaugural batch was announced in 2020, when former President S.R. Nathan was posthumously inducted. Selections are made every two years.\n\nBorn in Khangadogran, a village near Lahore in present-day Pakistan, Mr Hardial came to Malaya in 1911 at the age of six, when his father opened a provision shop in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn 1934, he ventured to Singapore with his brother, and set up a business dealing in textiles and food items. Their firm, Gian Singh and Company, located in Battery Road, served as a departmental store and living quarters.\n\nSupporting the battle for independence from colonial rule, Mr Hardial served as minister for trade and supplies in freedom fighter Subash Chandra Bose’s shadow cabinet. He endured torture from the Japanese occupiers for supplying essentials to British prisoners in Changi Jail.\n\nInstitutions that benefited from Mr Hardial’s philanthropy over the years include the Ramakrishna Mission, Sri Guru Nanak Sat-Sang Sabha and the then-Nanyang University.\n\n“When asked for the keys to his success, he often said everything comes from serving pious individuals,” Mr Hardial’s great-grandson A.J. Singh Bajaj said in his speech.\n\nBodybuilder S.K. Ramachandran was another posthumous award recipient during the event.\n\nHaving mentored athletes such as Tan Howe Liang, who won a silver medal in the 1960 Rome Olympics, Mr Ramachandran died in 2017 at the age of 90.\n\n“Eager to empower youths, he trained me and several others during my time in wrestling,” said IHFS committee member M. Letchmanan.\n\nOther inductees on the night included current and former athletes Shanti Pereira, U.K Shyam and Roy Krishnan, along with healthcare pioneers Dr Uma Rajan and Dr V.P. Nair.\n\nA former director of eldercare at the Ministry of Health, Dr Rajan, 84, is also known for implementing the health booklet (record system) for students in the 1980s.\n\nShe said: “Many of us are not spurred by awards to do good work in society. Nonetheless, I’m elated to be honoured among great achievers from the Indian community.”\n\nHardial Sing Bajaj (far right)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/23d8a273a99c2698b2ab8c82c96ceffb3f2593d8cc34b674dc4938e5c202a46c?w=825", "alt_text": "(Above) The inductees to the Indian Hall of Fame Singapore with Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling on May 25."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTamil Nadu Chief Minister and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for raising the Katchatheevu issue ahead of the parliamentary elections later this month.\n\nHe questioned why Prime Minister Narenda Modi has never spoken to the Sri Lankan government about the return of the island, which was “gifted away” by India in 1974, reported NDTV.\n\nKatchatheevu, an uninhibited strip of land spanning about 1.9 sq km, is located in the Palk Strait, a stretch of ocean which divides India and Sri Lanka. It lies close to Rameswaram town in Tamil Nadu and south-west of Sri Lanka’s Jaffna city.\n\nIt has no source of drinking water and the only structure on it is a church. But the small island has become a hot topic after fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who use it as a resting spot, have been shot at and arrested by the Sri Lankan navy, and Mr Modi accused the country’s opposition Congress party – which was in power at the time – of “callously” giving it away to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe DMK ruled the state at the time.\n\n“How many times has PM Narendra Modi gone to Sri Lanka in the last 10 years? Has he asked the Sri Lanka government to give back Katchatheevu even once?” said Mr Stalin.\n\nThe DMK leader said the BJP is trying to turn Katchatheevu into a controversy to gain votes in the southern state, where it has been trying hard to make inroads.\n\nTamil Nadu will vote in the first phase of the elections on April 19.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu chief minister further pointed out that in 2015, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who was then foreign secretary, had said that Katchatheevu was never a part of India – and now that elections are looming, his stance has changed.\n\n“For many years, whenever questions were raised in Parliament on Katchatheevu, no proper answer was given,” said Mr Stalin. “The BJP government said the case was in the Supreme Court. But now suddenly PM Modi is shedding crocodile tears for Katchatheevu.\n\n“In the last 10 years, PM Modi never spoke about Tamil fishermen’s arrests by the Sri Lankan navy. Has PM Modi condemned Sri Lanka ever?”\n\nThe controversy began on Sunday when Mr Modi shared an article from The Times of India on X, saying “Eye-opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu.”\n\nThe article was based on documents obtained by the BJP’s Tamil Nadu chief K. Annamalai. The documents quoted Mr Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s prime minister at the time, saying that he attached “no importance at all to (Katchatheevu)“, and that he “would have no hesitation in giving up (India’s) claims to it”.\n\nBut, according to the report, some officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and other experts said that India has a “good legal case” to assert claim over Katchatheevu, as they claimed the island was ruled by an Indian king continuously between 1875 and 1948.\n\nIn 1974, when Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi was prime minister, the Indian government ended the dispute with Sri Lanka by relinquishing any claim over the island.\n\nTwo years later, India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement that prevented people from both countries from fishing in waters belonging to the other.\n\nSince then, political parties in Tamil Nadu have regularly raised the issue of Katchatheevu and filed cases in court challenging the agreement with Sri Lanka – two of these cases are pending in the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter Mr Modi’s post, many BJP leaders and federal ministers joined him in criticising the Congress party. They also said the DMK did not do enough to retain Katchatheevu.\n\nThe DMK has denied this, saying its leaders were not aware of the decision to relinquish claim over the island until the agreement was completed.\n\n“The DMK had written several letters to the foreign ministry over the past decades, upholding the rights of Tamil Nadu’s fishermen over Katchatheevu. The BJP woke up to the issue only now, just as elections are nearing,” DMK spokesperson Saravanan Annadurai told the BBC.\n\nSri Lanka’s foreign minister said on April 3 that it does not see any need to re-open talks on the island.\n\n“This is a problem discussed and resolved 50 years ago and there is no necessity to have further discussions on this,” Mr Ali Sabry told the domestic Hiru television channel.\n\nSt. Anthony’s Church on Katchatheevu island, which attracts hundreds of visitors during an annual festival.\n\nPhoto: Telibrary.com\n\n“For many years, whenever questions were raised in Parliament on Katchatheevu, no proper answer was given.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMalayalam actor Fahadh Faasil said he was clinically diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of 41.\n\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the brain’s ability to regulate attention, behaviour and impulse control. It is common in children but can also affect adults.\n\nThese symptoms can further contribute to less productivity, leading to low self-esteem and mistrust of one’s abilities.\n\nAfter spending time at the Peace Valley Children’s Village in Kothamangalam, Kerala, on Sunday, Fahadh, said that, while roaming around the village – an institute focused on rehabilitating children with special needs – he asked a doctor whether it was easy to cure ADHD.\n\n“He told me it can be easily cured if it is diagnosed at a young age,” said the 41-year-old actor.\n\nHis statement comes after his Malayalam film Aavesham garnered widespread critical acclaim upon its release on April 11. Critics lauded its direction and outstanding performances, particularly by Fahadh and Sajin Gopu.\n\nKnown for his compelling performances in films like Malik, Joji, Vikram and Maamannan, Fahadh’s confession and openness about his diagnosis has sent shockwaves in the film Industry, especially in the South, leaving his fans downhearted by the news.\n\nFahadh has enjoyed a successful 2024, with Premalu, co-produced by him, also a box-office hit.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, ADHD is “one of the most common mental disorders” that “affects 8 per cent of children, mostly boys, and often lasts into adulthood”.\n\nYet, ADHD has remained highly underdiagnosed in many parts of the world, including India.\n\nInitially considered a “childhood problem”, an increasing number of adults have been approaching mental health professionals to address its symptoms.\n\nAccording to The World Federation of ADHD International Consensus Statement, the disorder occurs in 5.9 per cent of youth and 2.5 per cent of adults.\n\nMental health experts in Kerala also point out that chances of mis- and under-diagnosis are higher for adults.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1eff26ef6607d5f358338f6be16d8090d56004e6cf531c32f1ba9d0c57e8cae6?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn the latest twist to the fatal road accident in Pune last week, two doctors and a peon have been arrested for allegedly manipulating the blood test report of the 17-year-old driver, whose late-night drunk drive left two 24-year-old software engineers dead.\n\nDr Ajay Tawade and Dr Srihari Harnor of Sassoon Hospital were arrested on Monday by the Pune Crime Branch, which is investigating the case that has sparked nationwide outrage.\n\nPune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar told the media that samples collected at the hospital and sent for forensic tests were not of the juvenile accused. “This means the sample was replaced,” he said.\n\n“Around 11am on May 19, a blood sample (of the teen) that was taken at Sassoon Hospital was thrown in a dustbin and the blood sample of another person was taken and sent to the forensic lab.\n\n“Chief Medical Officer Srihari Halnor replaced this blood sample. During the investigation, we found Srihari Halnor replaced this on the instructions of Ajay Tawade, head of the forensic medicine department at Sassoon Hospital.”\n\nThe phones of both doctors have been seized. Investigation has revealed that Dr Tawade and the teen accused’s father spoke over the phone on the day of the accident, Commissioner Kumar told the media.\n\nSources told NDTV that Mr Atul Ghatkamble, a peon at the hospital who was also arrested, collected Rs3 lakh ($4,860) from the teen’s family and gave it to the doctors.\n\nDr Tawade, during questioning, said the minor’s blood samples were replaced by those of a doctor. Officials said the samples were swapped to remove the traces of alcohol.\n\n“I will not keep quiet. I will take everyone’s name,” Dr Tawade reportedly said during the investigation.\n\nEarlier, reports claimed that the teen, who is now at an observation home, had tested negative for alcohol. However, CCTV footage from one of the bars he visited that night showed him drinking with friends.\n\nCommissioner Kumar had earlier said: “This case is not about an accident in which a mistake happened under the influence of alcohol and people died. Our case is that he had full knowledge (of) his conduct... he parties in two bars, rashly drives a car without a number plate on a narrow, congested street. He was fully in his senses, and he knew that people might die because of his actions.”\n\nThe city police chief also said that two samples of the teen’s blood were tested at different times after the accident to ensure accurate results.\n\nAccording to police sources, the first blood sample had no alcohol, but the second did. This raised suspicions and a DNA test was conducted.\n\nThe DNA test revealed the samples were from different people, meaning that the minor’s blood sample was switched with that of another person to ensure that his report did not mention alcohol.\n\nThe teen belongs to a prominent real estate developer’s family, and it is alleged that his father and grandfather tried to influence the legal process to shield him.\n\nThe teen’s father was arrested under charges of the Juvenile Justice Act. His grandfather was also arrested after the family’s driver alleged that he was confined at the family’s home, threatened and asked to take the blame for the accident.\n\nThe other arrests in the case include staff of the two bars the teen visited that night. The doctors’ arrest and allegations of manipulation of blood samples further strengthens the charge that the family blatantly used money and influence to protect the teen.\n\nTwo IT engineers – Ashwini Kostha and Anish Awadhiya – were on a bike when they were hit from behind by the teen’s Porsche. They died on the spot.\n\nThe teen was granted bail within 15 hours of the accident on conditions seen as flimsy – he was asked to write a 300-word essay on road accidents, told to work with traffic cops for 15 days and seek counselling for his drinking habit.\n\nAmid nationwide outrage, the Juvenile Justice Board later modified the order and sent him to an observation home. The police have urged the board for permission to try the teen accused – aged 17 years and eight months – as an adult.\n\nThe families of the two engineers have said this is “murder, not accident” and sought stringent punishment for the accused.\n\n“Around 11am on May 19, a blood sample (of the teen) that was taken at Sassoon Hospital was thrown in a dustbin and the blood sample of another person was taken and sent to the forensic lab.”\n\nPune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8d90ea75051a608ab50e1a30af5c680b8521f6940fb1f79131f470b4cfaf98f5?w=825", "alt_text": "Dr Ajay Tawade (left) and Dr Srihari Harnor."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA temperature reading collected in Delhi on Wednesday may have broken the national record as India grapples with a blistering heat wave.\n\nThe reading – 52.9 deg C – was preliminary and needed verification, officials said. But, if confirmed, it would be the highest temperature ever registered anywhere in India, beating the 51 deg C recorded at Phalodi in Rajasthan in May 2016.\n\nThe reading came from a substation in Mungeshpur, a Delhi neighborhood, reported Reuters. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said the reading could be due to a sensor issue or some other error, and that it would examine the data and the sensor.\n\nAmid the heat wave, where temperatures have crossed 49 deg C, people in Delhi as well as the northern states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were advised to avoid heat exposure. A “red” weather alert was issued by the IMD on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe red alert, designating “heat wave to severe heat wave” conditions, urged people to keep cool and stay hydrated, as at least three deaths were reported, according to the BBC.\n\nTemperatures soared outside Delhi too. On Tuesday, it was 50.5 deg C in an area around a substation in Rajasthan, a desert state that in the past has recorded some of India’s highest temperatures. Another substation in the city of Sirsa, which is further north, came up with a similar reading on Tuesday – 50.3 deg C.\n\nHeat waves are most common in India during this time of the year – March until June with a peak in May.

The US team will also be making their World Cup debut when they face neighbours Canada in the tournament-opener on June 1.\n\nThe team is made up mainly of semi-professional cricketers of South Asian heritage, with former New Zealand star Corey Anderson switching allegiance to his adopted homeland.\n\nFormer Indian first-class cricketer Milind Kumar and former India U-19 player Harmeet Singh are also part of the squad.\n\nSpeaking to the Press Trust of India, Pisike agreed it is a major challenge to take cricket to the masses in the US.\n\n“So far, cricket is predominantly an expats’ game, but with the marketing and promotional activities during the World Cup, there will be some momentum, and the World Cup will definitely boost the opportunities to expand the game in the US,” said Pisike.\n\n“Then there is the opportunity for cricket to be in the Olympics – that will definitely attract the community because the US is a huge sports country.”\n\nThe World Cup will be played across three venues in the US – New York, Miami and Dallas -– but the facility that has been under close watch is in New York where India and Pakistan face off on June 9.\n\nIndia will also play Ireland and the US in the 34,000-capacity makeshift stadium in Eisenhower Park.\n\n“The new stadium will become a wonder of cricketing infrastructure,” said Pisike. “The pitches were recently brought in (from Australia) and dropped into the stadium. We are expecting decent pitches in terms of striking a balance between the bat and ball.”\n\nWith the World Cup taking place at home, the US squad did not train in India as it has done in the past. But Pisike is seeking the Indian cricket board’s (BCCI) help with the US players’ training and exposure after the mega event.\n\n“In the past, we have sent our men’s team to Karnataka before they participated in the Cricket World Cup qualifiers in 2022,” he said.\n\n“There are several discussions happening with various cricket associations and we definitely want to partner with and use the resources available.”\n\nThe BCCI recently made it clear that associate nations cannot directly get in touch with state units, and all requests must be routed through the parent body.\n\nThe previous cricket body in the US was suspended by the International Cricket Council due to governance issues, and the current regime was given recognition in 2019.\n\nPisike acknowledged the challenges on that front. “The governance will be streamlined with the opportunity to become an Olympic National Governing Body because the US Olympics requires certain guidelines to be followed and certain policies to be adopted,” he said.\n\n“In terms of financial management and other related activities, we are fully in compliance compared to the previous regime.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f3e71fffe890e084475071b215ce5e3f148eeae9e29043f6502e6230d80a64a8?w=825", "alt_text": "The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium at Eisenhower Park in New York."}]}

During those calls, she would recount the events of her school day to him, before playfully switching roles and instructing him to be the student while she assumed the role of teacher.\n\nOn some days, her mother would urge her to keep the calls short as her father needed rest after a long day’s work, but Mahasri was always determined to speak to her father for as long as she could.\n\nAccording to Mr Naveenkumar, the younger daughter Srinisha is still struggling to comprehend her father’s death.\n\n“At the funeral, she could only cry and gaze perplexedly at the tearful faces surrounding her,” he said in Tamil.\n\nMr Sivaraman, who was a cleaning operations manager at Supersonic Maintenance Services, was discovered unconscious at the PUB facility on May 23 at around 11.15am. He was pronounced dead at the hospital later that day.\n\nTwo Malaysian workers had also inhaled the gas and were found unconscious. One died on May 28, while the other was moved from intensive care the same day. His condition is said to be stable.\n\nPreliminary investigations revealed that the workers had inhaled hydrogen sulphide gas, a by-product of the water treatment process, said PUB.\n\nMr Naveenkumar said the children, having been apart from their father for a year and a half, had been thrilled to spend an entire month in Singapore with him, even taking additional leave days from school.\n\n“The last twenty days was a period of unparalleled joy. Every evening, my family and Sivaraman’s family would happily gather and go on trips to beaches, temples and parks,” he said.\n\n“Sivaraman had meticulously planned a vacation in Malaysia as well, starting on May 27.\n\n“On the morning of the incident, he left for work telling his family to be ready by 5pm for a trip to Gardens by the Bay. His daughters were so excited about this.\n\n“But then I got a call at 3pm informing me that Sivaraman had been hospitalised. My sister and I rushed to the hospital, only to discover that he had died. We were left in complete shock.”\n\nMs Narmatha, who had been married to Mr Sivaraman for 11 years, was overcome with grief, said her brother. She tried to explain the situation to her children, but couldn’t muster the words.\n\nThe news of Mr Sivaraman’s death has cast a shadow over his village. Relatives, friends and villagers gathered on Wednesday to catch a final glimpse of his body before it was taken to the cremation grounds. They adorned him with flowers, garlands and heartfelt prayers.\n\n“He was regarded by everyone as a warm-hearted and compassionate soul who always lent a helping hand to anyone in need,” said Mr Naveenkumar.\n\n“How can you expect me not to cry when you tell me that my father will never be with me again?”\n\nMahasri, 9, when told of her father’s death", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2f14c4bd6248f9781bbea23912edef7681afbffaa921554a42c687216919cebe?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives and friends at the funeral of Mr Srinivasan Sivaraman in Kambarnatham in Tamil Nadu on May 29."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cefb5c1f97ed81204f0fa79f5b9095f81663520901bd3ff6421c59cf0c28a974?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives and friends at the funeral of Mr Srinivasan Sivaraman in Kambarnatham in Tamil Nadu on May 29."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2f14c4bd6248f9781bbea23912edef7681afbffaa921554a42c687216919cebe?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives and friends at the funeral of Mr Srinivasan Sivaraman in Kambarnatham in Tamil Nadu on May 29."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cefb5c1f97ed81204f0fa79f5b9095f81663520901bd3ff6421c59cf0c28a974?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives and friends at the funeral of Mr Srinivasan Sivaraman in Kambarnatham in Tamil Nadu on May 29."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2f14c4bd6248f9781bbea23912edef7681afbffaa921554a42c687216919cebe?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives and friends at the funeral of Mr Srinivasan Sivaraman in Kambarnatham in Tamil Nadu on May 29."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAnasuya Sengupta is on cloud nine, and she has every reason to be.\n\nShe has etched her name in history by becoming the first Indian to win the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe 38-year-old received the trophy in the Un Certain Regard segment for her portrayal of Renuka in the film The Shameless. The movie was written and directed by Bulgarian filmmaker Constantin Bojanov.\n\nAnasuya told the Hindustan Times: “I couldn’t believe it was happening! But as I shakily walked to the stage and stood with artistes I have admired, my heroes, it felt oddly natural to be welcomed with so much authenticity and love by them. I am so grateful to the jury for seeing my hard work.”\n\nShe later spoke about the hard work she put in for The Shameless: “I auditioned for it, my director Constantin had reached out. It was a lead role.\n\n“I have worked so hard for so long. It all feels worth it when I look back, and all the pieces are wonderfully coming together for me finally.”\n\nThe Shameless was screened at the 77th Cannes Film Festival on May 17. The film revolves around Renuka (played by Anasuya), who manages to escape from a Delhi brothel after killing a police officer. The movie also features Omara Shetty, Auroshikha Dey and Rohit Kokate in pivotal roles.\n\nBorn in Bengal, Anasuya studied English Literature at Jadavpur University, near Kolkata. Initially, she aspired to be a journalist, but her plans took a different direction.\n\nShe landed a supporting role in the film Madly Bengali, released in 2009. Later that year, she moved to Mumbai to pursue further opportunities in acting.\n\nHer brother Abhishek worked in the film industry and Anasuya sought acting opportunities for herself.\n\nStruggling to find roles, she worked in the art department of films before working as a production designer. Anasuya was actually one of the production designers for the first season of Netflix show Masaba Masaba.\n\nIn an interview with My Kolkata, Anasuya said: “As a production designer in Mumbai, the projects I hold the closest to my heart include Sanjeev Sharma’s Saat Uchakkey (2016), starring the likes of Manoj Bajpayee and Anupam Kher, and Srijit Mukherji’s Forget Me Not, starring Ali Fazal as part of the Netflix anthology Ray (2021).”\n\nAlthough it seemed like all was going well for Anasuya, there was a time she felt lost and claustrophobic.\n\n“All through my years in Mumbai, although connected to the world of art in some form or the other, a part of me felt lost, claustrophobic, almost devoid of free expression,” Anasuya told My Kolkata.\n\nThis made her take a leap of faith and shift to Goa with support from her father. “I was unaware of how financially sustainable the decision was or where my career curve would meander. However, amid the chaos, it was my father who held my hand and asked, ‘what’s the worst that can happen?’ And that sealed the deal.”\n\nCurrently, she resides in North Goa with her male actor friend Tanmay Dhanania, who is also from Kolkata.\n\nTanmay accompanied her to Cannes, and they both shared an emotional post on their social media accounts, which read: “Two people from a city called Calcutta live in a house called Thomsuli in a village called Marna in Goa.\n\n“They have been friends for half their lives and have a cat called Mowgli. These two people are in a town called Cannes with a film called The Shameless. Some things are unbelievable. And some things are inevitable. Oddly enough, this is both.”\n\n“I have worked so hard for so long.

Kavi\n\nகி. ஜனார்த்தனன்\n\nMs Elizabeth Meera Palgunan clutches a bolster imprinted with a life-sized likeness of her infant son Adam as she sits down for our interview at her Woodlands Circle flat.\n\nIn the middle of the living room is a shrine where garlands drape over a metre-high poster of Adam, next to an assortment of clothes, trinkets and baby accessories.\n\nIt’s been four years since the death of her son, but the 41-year-old Meera keeps his memory alive every year on Mother’s Day and various other occasions.\n\nIn her mind, she says, Adam will always be six months old.\n\n“Adam was my husband’s first child and the first grandchild for his parents,” said Ms Meera, who has a 17-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.\n\n“Nothing was amiss during my pregnancy. My family were eagerly preparing for his birth, and friends and loved ones were buying clothes,” she recalls.\n\nBut when Adam was born on Oct 16, 2019, doctors soon realised he was not breathing normally. A trachea had to be inserted into his throat to assist his breathing.\n\nHe was later diagnosed with congenital laryngomalacia, a condition where the soft, immature cartilage of the larynx collapses inward during inhalation, causing airway obstruction.\n\nAdam was afflicted by other prenatal conditions too, including low blood pressure in the liver. He also had to be fed milk via tubes.\n\nRequiring constant hospital care, Adam was treated at one of the Ronald McDonald House Charities Singapore family rooms, a facility set up within National University Hospital for critically ill children and their parents.\n\nMs Meera recalls there were about 20 sets of parents staying at the facility.\n\n“Some children recovered while others didn’t. We were witnessing both sets of reactions from parents, wondering which outcome would happen for us.”\n\nSoon after, circuit breaker measures reduced the number of parents allowed to stay in the facility.\n\n“While my husband could visit me, he could not stay over,” Ms Meera says. “If anything had happened in his absence, I would have been all alone.”\n\nShe remembers her husband, Bala Murugan Masapsami, 46, refusing to carry his infant son at the time, proclaiming that if he were to carry Adam, “it would be to carry him home”.\n\nEventually he relented, carrying the baby on the last day he was alive. “Adam was holding onto his life for that moment,” Ms Meera says with tears glistening in her eyes.\n\nAdam died on May 2, 2020.\n\nAdjunct Associate Professor Jacqueline Ong, a senior consultant in the division of paediatric critical care at NUH, said congenital laryngomalacia can be severe in some cases, leading to significant breathing difficulties, feeding problems and poor weight gain.\n\n“Adam’s case was exceptionally severe where the abnormal softening of the airway (malacia) extended to his lower airways as well, creating profound difficulty in breathing,” she said.\n\nMs Meera describes clearing away Adam’s clothes and the gifts bought for him as a particularly painful period.\n\n“I do regret disregarding my mother’s advice not to buy so many clothes before his birth,” she says.\n\n“But I was also advised by my elders not to take pictures of the newborn. Had I not done so, I would barely have anything to remember him by.”\n\nShe was despondent for a long period after her son’s death, and it took a while for her to steer her focus back to her daughter.\n\n“At the time, I was unable to be there for my daughter during her PSLE, and many other milestones. All my attention went to Adam.”\n\nEven today, as evinced by the living room altar and the bolster with Adam’s photo, Ms Meera can’t fully let go of her son’s memory.\n\nOn occasions such Mother’s Day and Adam’s birthday and death anniversary, she hosts family and friends to commemorate her late son.\n\n“Some people try and comfort me by saying he’s in a better place, but can there be a better place for a child other than here with his mother?”\n\nStill, Ms Meera says she tries not to be stuck in the past, and has recently turned to Facebook groups where she can provide a listening ear for and give advice to grieving mothers.\n\n“We wanted to teach Adam and raise him into a fine young man. In the end, what he taught us about the value of life was greater,” she says.\n\n“Some people try and comfort me by saying he’s in a better place, but can there be a better place for a child other than here with his mother?”\n\nMs Elizabeth Meera Palgunan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d4896ac56bbad6bcece0ff7da868a4668ccf4de7779ee1878274b4f2036dfe56?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Elizabeth Meera Palgunan with a bolster bearing the likeness of her son Adam, who died six months after birth."}]}

Selvananthan, 56, founding director of Avant Theatre and Language, the involvement of youth on all three fronts – behind the scenes, on stage and in the front rows of the audience – is a heartening trend.\n\n“The Tamil theatre scene here has changed significantly from the 80s and 90s,” he says.\n\n“We used to put up plays focusing on societal problems. Now, we have different groups focusing on different aspects of Tamil theatre, so there is variety for a younger audience.”\n\nThe four major theatre groups in the Tamil theatre industry today – Avant Theatre and Language, Agam Theatre Lab, Athipathi, and Singapore Indian Theatre and Films Explorers (SITFE) – offer various genres and styles of productions while opening their doors to budding actors and directors.\n\nMany young actors are now taking the step up to such theatre groups straight from their school productions, says founder of Agam Theatre Lab Subramanian Ganesh.\n\n“We have explored new ways to bring theatre to the younger audiences, and even used VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) to stage a literary play (Duruyodhana), Mr Ganesh, 39, says.\n\nThough the Tamil theatre scene in Singapore came to life in the 1930s, the 1980s to 2000s were its flourishing years, as multiple drama groups entered the fore. One that stood out was the currently inactive Ravindran Drama Group (RDG), where many of today’s industry leaders got their start.\n\nIn the 2010s, local dramas were added to the Ministry of Education Tamil Literature syllabus, especially in junior colleges.\n\nAs with most industries, things dialled down during the pandemic, but the scene has since regained momentum with a string of productions.\n\nTamil theatre companies have been rather active over the last few years. In 2023, for instance, there were six productions across the four major theatre groups. Four of them involved a cast and crew primarily under the age of 23 – Avant’s Raasi, Athipathi’s Athipathi, Agam’s Vidhai, and SITFE’s Solo.\n\nThese shows were staged in various theatres, such as the Esplanade Theatre Studio, with some playing to a sold-out audience.\n\n“The scene is growing; theatre groups are coming up with more productions in recent years, which in turn has provided more opportunities for young actors” says Mr Selva.\n\nMs M. Priyaatharshini, 23, who acted in Avant’s Parameswara, said the Tamil theatre scene here provides a refreshing experience as most of the stories are based on the “Singaporean diasporan context”, compared with Tamil films and TV series, which are based mostly in India.\n\n“I wanted to explore acting after watching the stage dramas here,” she said. “Acting in a play opened my eyes to the hours of dedication and hard work behind it. It was exhausting but the high I got from my last show (Parameswara) was priceless.”\n\nBudding actors are also making the leap to Tamil from English theatre, such as Mikhil Anand, who played the lead in the short drama Naai, one of five segments in Agam’s Panikkan earlier this month.\n\nThe 23-year-old fell in love with acting after his parents enrolled him in his primary school’s drama club to aid with his stammer. “I transitioned to Tamil theatre after doing Tamil dramas in school, realising that this space gave me a stronger sense of community,” he said.\n\n“I always found it harder to draw a connection to my English characters compared to my Tamil characters.”\n\nIt’s not just the acting bug that has caught on. Mr Subramanian Karthikeyan, 22, has always had a penchant for directing, and sees the stage as a medium that allows him to bring his vision of storytelling to life.\n\n“I started as a fan of movies, but over time I realised that theatre had a magic that films did not,” said Mr Karthikeyan, who made his directorial debut in 2023 with Sangae Muzhangu, staged by the National University of Singapore’s Tamil Language Society.\n\nWhile the industry welcomes one and all, regardless of age, SITFE founder Saleem Hadi says youth should come into it with a “learning mindset”.\n\n“As long as they do not come into the scene to chase fame, they’ll do fine. They need to come in with a learning mindset to get the most out of the experience,” he said.\n\nBy Yugesh Kannan\n\n“I transitioned to Tamil theatre after doing Tamil dramas in school, realising that this space gave me a stronger sense of community.”\n\nActor Mikhil Anand (left).", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ff5ca37ab991fc56341071c2f8fe61968749f7f849b658eae87ff7725f28c3fb?w=825", "alt_text": "Gayathiri Varadaradjo (seated) and Solai Lakshmi Priya in Agam Theatre Lab’s Panikkan at Aliwal Arts Centre earlier this month."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2644ca9e4c446df87b91d8b6f5d7ac484902f001b58c9288c106d8d9ed312e74?w=825", "alt_text": "Gayathiri Varadaradjo (seated) and Solai Lakshmi Priya in Agam Theatre Lab’s Panikkan at Aliwal Arts Centre earlier this month."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ff5ca37ab991fc56341071c2f8fe61968749f7f849b658eae87ff7725f28c3fb?w=825", "alt_text": "Gayathiri Varadaradjo (seated) and Solai Lakshmi Priya in Agam Theatre Lab’s Panikkan at Aliwal Arts Centre earlier this month."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2644ca9e4c446df87b91d8b6f5d7ac484902f001b58c9288c106d8d9ed312e74?w=825", "alt_text": "Gayathiri Varadaradjo (seated) and Solai Lakshmi Priya in Agam Theatre Lab’s Panikkan at Aliwal Arts Centre earlier this month."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ff5ca37ab991fc56341071c2f8fe61968749f7f849b658eae87ff7725f28c3fb?w=825", "alt_text": "Gayathiri Varadaradjo (seated) and Solai Lakshmi Priya in Agam Theatre Lab’s Panikkan at Aliwal Arts Centre earlier this month."}]}

So, I wanted to create one that people like me can use.”\n\nThe website has three different interfaces for three types of learning sensitivities. For students with colour blindness, the site uses a universal colour scheme – orange, blue and white – allowing them to see the content clearer.\n\nThe font used in the pages for dyslexic students is thicker and more spaced out, making it easier to read. For students with ADHD, there is a timer that prompts a pop-up notification for them to take a break – ensuring their short attention spans are accommodated.\n\nHe was inspired to create the website for his school’s Learning Support Department, which assists students with various learning sensitivities.\n\nMs Gillian Sams, Head of Learning Support (Senior School), said the website will be piloted by Year 9 and 10 students in the coming weeks to gather student feedback.\n\nShe said: “When Krishiv met me to share his website, we discussed the challenges for neurodiverse learners and how he could make his website more accessible. We talked about font size and colour, ease of navigation, timed exercises and a feature to have the questions read audibly.”\n\nThe school has pitched the website to various International Baccalaureate schools overseas, and hopes to discuss it with the Ministry of Education as well, Krishiv revealed.\n\nKrishiv, who aims to pursue a postgraduate degree in mathematics and become a professor, picked up basic computer science and programming skills from YouTube videos and took a free online computer science course from Harvard University to build the website.\n\nCurrently, he is footing the site’s maintenance bill with his family’s help.\n\n“I want to keep the website free of charge for users so that more students can benefit from it,” he said. “I did not make this website with the motivation of profit.”\n\nBy Yugesh Kannan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e272bf07866ee151726bc43807c3ffd91fe8d96b678e98f5bc2101cce4ba928c?w=825", "alt_text": "Krishiv Kukreja"}]}

If you go into it with the right attitude, then everything will be fine.”\n\nThen, rather amusingly, he reappropriated one of his own chants (to the tune of Live is Life by Opus) in honour of the Dutchman. “Arne Slot, NA NA NA NA NA!” he shouted in tune. The supporters took it on instantly.\n\nIt was vintage Klopp to the end – colourful, hilarious and magnanimous – and another highlight in a YouTube compilation of the man’s greatest hits.\n\nThere are numerous such clips online – some even 40 minutes long – comprising snippets of his post-match conference antics and soundbites over the years at Merseyside.\n\nLike the time he got excited over a translator’s “erotic voice”. Or the time he was baffled by a thick Birmingham accent – “Sorry, what!?”. Or my personal favourite: the time he misheard “brain fog” to be something else and asked rather petulantly why others can swear but he can’t.\n\nAll this, in addition to a compilation of the epic Liverpool matches he presided over that drove Anfield into a frenzy. The Europa League semi-final comeback against Dortmund in 2016, Divock Origi’s stoppage-time winner against Everton, thrashing Manchester United 7-0. And not least of all the astonishing comeback at home to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in 2019.\n\nLiverpool fans will be watching those clips for years to come now that the man has left Anfield after nine memorable years.\n\nWatching the farewell event, I had hoped that, in the words of football columnist Oliver Kay, Klopp would pull a move from the Wolf Of Wall Street, pick up the microphone and yell, “I’m not leaving! The show goes on!”\n\nBut he is leaving. The show is over. Anfield will move on, but oh how we will miss the charismatic German, fist pumps and bear hugs et al.\n\nA friend – a non-footballing person, I should point out – chimed in while the camera panned to sobbing fans in the Kop during Klopp’s guard of honour on the pitch: “ You know, he only won one league title in his nine years. Isn’t all this a bit much?”\n\nIn rare moment of restraint, I paused and considered his words before reacting.\n\nIf Klopp had won four more games over his nine-year spell at Liverpool, he would be leaving with three Premier Leagues and three Champions Leagues rather than one of each.\n\nHad Liverpool beaten Real Madrid in their two Champions League final encounters in 2018 and 2022, those additional European Cups would have been added to Anfield’s trophy room.\n\nAnd twice the Reds missed out on Premier League honours to Manchester City by an agonising point – even after finishing on one occasion with a whopping tally of 97.\n\nSo was the Klopp era more a story of great success or what might have been?\n\nIt took a few seconds before I perished the thought.\n\n“You can keep your trophies and stats,” I shot back.\n\nAnalysts and armchair experts can debate all they want about “legacy” and whether Klopp measures up to the great managers in the history of the game. But what Klopp means to Liverpool fans is personal; it transcends stats and comparisons to others.\n\n“Trophies and medals, they get put away somewhere in the clubhouse and you forget when exactly it was and who won which trophy when,” he said in 2015.\n\n“What’s important is the moment itself, the memory of being there at the game, that you were part of it.”\n\nI’m glad to have been a part of the full throttle “heavy-metal” footballing ride that was Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.\n\nAnd I’ll be bookmarking all those YouTube videos of him for the years to come.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/87fdcb244c312c71aa1b9841ea4714d61d592292a5e231db45446607f5cf829a?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nNot many in Singapore have heard of him. But those who appreciate good music saw Pradeep Kumar’s (left) originality and creativity when he performed at the Star Theatre on Wednesday.\n\nThe Tiruchirappalli-bred singer belted out Tamil songs which mainly had folk and melodic strains. Most of them were his own compositions and those of his close collaborators Santhosh Narayanan and Sean Roldan.\n\n“I first performed at Kalaa Utsavam in Singapore 12 years ago,” Pradeep told tabla!. “But that was as part of the band I was performing with. This time I have come with my own repertoire of songs and a band I regularly perform with.”\n\nThe 38-year-old was introduced by music maestro A.R. Rahman to the Tamil cinema singing industry in 2010.\n\nFrom then on, almost all of Pradeep’s songs have made it to the chartbuster list. His voice has magic for sure, but he often does not appear as the face of a song because he prefers a low profile.\n\nOn Wednesday, he sang numbers such as Nee Kavithaigala (from the film Maragatha Nanayam), Aagayam Theepiditha (Madras), Kannamma (Kaala) and Poda Poda (Iruthi Sutru).\n\nAll had a splendid personal touch and it felt like he was talking to you, telling a story. “For every artiste, his art should represent him,” said Pradeep. “So I have to use my voice in the right way.  I don’t spend time giving interviews and I don’t talk much because I want to perfect my voice and sing more.”\n\nPradeep was deft on the guitar and had a superb band to back him. When he did peppy numbers, they were excellent. Pradeep’s wife Kalyani Nair, a trained singer, also joined him for a few duets.\n\n“Pradeep’s voice comes across as genuine and relatable,” said NUS student Aruna Kandasamy, 23. “The concert was a magical experience, with his singing and the band’s sublime performance. I thoroughly enjoyed it.”\n\nPradeep will release his first independent album soon. “It is recorded completely on analogue and will be exciting,” he said.\n\nV.K.

I needed to make one point in two games, so I wasn’t sure whether I should play for a win or play safe.”\n\nCalling the win against Esipenko his “best game ever”, Siddharth added: “Normally I don’t play such exciting games. I had lost the day before in a very unpleasant game (and was) completely outplayed by Abhimanyu Mishra.”\n\nWith a Fide performance rating of 2,508, the Grade 11 student of an online school had never beaten a player rated above 2,600 before the Sharjah Masters, where he had three wins, three draws and three losses.\n\nHe beat Hungarian grandmaster Tamas Banusz (2,623 rating) in Round 2 and India’s Abhijeet Gupta (2,601) in Round 6 before taking Esipenko’s (2,703) scalp. Siddharth lost to Uzbek grandmaster Javokhir Sindarov (2,684) in his final game on May 22.\n\nSingapore have four other grandmasters – Wong Meng Kong, 60; Wu Shaobin, 55; Kevin Goh, 40; and Tin Jingyao, 23 – and one woman grandmaster, Gong Qianyun, 39.\n\nMr Goh, who is also the chief executive officer of the Singapore Chess Federation (SCF), told The Straits Times on May 22 that Siddharth had been working towards this dream for many years.\n\n“After he completed his international master title in 2022, he pushed for this next jump to the next level. Along the way he had many setbacks, encountered many challenges and could not get good results for almost a year and a half.\n\n“I’m just very happy that finally this year he managed to make that next step, finding a new approach to playing the game.”\n\nSiddharth, who trains four to five times a week at the SCF, started playing chess in 2015 when he was introduced to the game by his father. He achieved the Fide master rank in 2019, before attaining his international master rank in 2022.\n\nMr Goh says that the next step for the teenager is to “work towards the SEA Games”. He said: “Whether he intends to turn professional or not, it’s another question.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMusician A.R. Rahman likes to say: “When I am feeling low, I always think of my fans, and it lifts my spirits.”\n\nThe Oscar winner has certainly thought of his fans in Singapore and lifted their spirits, following the announcement by organiser Maestro Productions Global on Tuesday that he will perform at the National Stadium on Aug 31.\n\nIt will be his fourth concert in Singapore, after his previous one on April 30, 2014, at Gardens by the Bay was marred by technical glitches and a blackout.\n\nAt 57 years old, Rahman’s reputation as one of the most eminent musical talents in India, or for that matter the world, requires no further credence.\n\nHis performance in Singapore, the first by an Indian musician at the National Stadium, is expected to transport fans across a journey of his most recognisable songs from a career spanning three decades of film and television.\n\nMaestro is pulling out all the stops for a grand event, including partnering with Singapore-based event management company UnUsUal Entertainment, which has experience in delivering big musical shows at the National Stadium.\n\n“It will be a solid three hours of Rahman,” Maestro’s chairman Parthiban Murugaiyan told tabla! “The concert will consist of all his greatest hits. It will be an evening of Rahman rhapsody.\n\n“Rahman has a pan-Indian reach, and we expect to sell up to 40,000 tickets. We are sure the South Indian, North Indian and other Indian communities will be there. We also expect Malay and Indonesian fans to attend, as he has a strong following among them. His music is universal. And I’m sure that everybody will be able to enjoy it.\n\n“The concert is a proud moment for any Indian in Singapore because one of their kind will be performing at the National Stadium, where you usually see the likes of Taylor Swift and Coldplay.”\n\nStandard tickets for the Swift concert series at the National Stadium ranged from $348 to $108. Ticket prices for the Rahman concert, which will be announced by June 9, are expected to be “reasonable”, according to the organisers.\n\nRahman will perform at Kuala Lumpur’s Bukit Jalil National Stadium on July 27. But his gig there will not be as wide ranging as his slate of songs scheduled for Singapore.\n\n“I’m thrilled an absolute legend is coming to Singapore,” said marketing executive Priyaa, 29. “His melodies are timeless and I’m hoping he’ll sing Mazhai Kuruvi from the film Chekka Chivantha Vaanam.”\n\nBusiness administrator Rachannaa V, 26, said: “As a 90s kid who grew with the beats of A.R. Rahman, I’m excited about this musical feast. I’ve never heard him live and I’m looking forward to hearing the masterpieces. His music has become an integral part of our lives, and to witness it live is going to be a divine experience.”\n\nThe recent string of sold-out shows in Singapore from big-name musicians such as Swift, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars has whetted concertgoers’ appetite for more. And Maestro is hoping to cash in on that.\n\n“It’s been more than 10 years since Rahman last came here, and the concert landscape has changed post-Covid,” said Mr Parthiban.\n\n“Now it’s not only about watching music videos on TV or YouTube or going to the cinema to watch a movie with songs. Live concerts have become another vertical for entertainment, as people get more than what they get from being in the cinema.\n\n“In the three hours, they forget everything else and just enjoy the moment – cheering, clapping and shouting, releasing their emotions freely. That’s what we want them to experience when they come for Rahman’s concert.”\n\nAt outdoor venues, the acoustics can be a problem. When Rahman performed in Singapore in 2014, the sound quality was terrible and the production values were suspect.\n\nThere were more people on the lawns at Gardens by the Bay than at his Singapore Indoor Stadium gig in 2005, as well as his Marina Bay Sands outing in 2011. But missing was the real sound of his music as there were technical glitches, including a loud sound on stage followed by a blackout.\n\nMr Parthiban said the Aug 31 show will be well-rehearsed with a rigorous technical run, as Maestro, UnUsUal and Rahman are known for their attention to detail.\n\n“Maeastro has established ourselves as a leading Indian concert organiser because of our perfection. We have done concerts in Canada and Australia without a glitch and before sold-out crowds. We will be doing four more shows in North America and Singapore this year.”\n\nOn May 10, Maestro featured South Indian singer and composer Anirudh Ravichander in Melbourne before a sell-out 15,000 crowd. Two days later, it was the same story in Sydney in front of 10,000 fans.\n\n“We can see that fans are enjoying our concert experience, and we want to raise the bar,” said Mr Parthiban. “We were the first to organise an Indian concert featuring Anirudh at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in March 2023, with a 360-degree stage.\n\n“And we are the first to go into the National Stadium with an Indian musician, which is actually a massive step for any Indian concert.\n\n“It speaks volumes of how far the Indian music industry has reached in Singapore and how strongly the Indian community is supporting such concepts.”\n\nOscar-winning music maestro A.

The judge will next hear the case on May 29.\n\nA key point of contention, which the court will have to rule on, is where, when and by whom the dish was first made – by Mr Gujral in Peshawar, Mr Jaggi in New Delhi, or if both should be credited.\n\nButter chicken is ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas, and bragging rights about who invented it can matter, brand experts said.\n\n“Being an inventor has a huge advantage globally and in terms of consumer appeal. You are also entitled to charge more,” said Mr Dilip Cherian, an image guru and co-founder of Indian PR firm Perfect Relations.\n\nMoti Mahal operates a franchisee model with over 100 outlets globally. Its butter chicken dishes start at US$8 ($10.80) in New Delhi, and are priced at US$23 in New York.\n\nLate United States President Richard Nixon and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru are among the famous clients to have visited its primary outlet in Delhi.\n\nDaryaganj started in 2019 and its butter chicken costs US$7.50. It has 10 outlets, mostly in New Delhi, with plans to expand to other Indian cities and Bangkok.\n\nIn its 2,752-page lawsuit, Moti Mahal had also accused Daryaganj of copying “the look and feel” of the interiors of its outlets.\n\nDaryaganj has retorted with photographs of restaurant interiors which the judge will review, claiming it is Moti Mahal that has copied its “design of floor tiles”.\n\nReuters\n\n“Being an inventor has a huge advantage globally and in terms of consumer appeal.

And marking each of them with a frozen Sara Lee cake without the presence of your family and friends.\n\nNot that Military Expert 3 Hariiheran Naidu minds too much. After all, he did have his “navy brothers” with him; men who put their lives in one another’s hands on board a warship.\n\nThe 36-year-old naval submariner has been working in a submarine for the past 16 years – a job, he says, that often prompts a line of questions from curious friends and acquaintances.\n\n“It was my father’s idea to get me into swimming, from there I just had an affinity with the water,” he tells tabla!\n\n“After working as a lifeguard during my teens, I learnt about the navy and that it had everything to do with water, so I took a leap of faith and signed up – without knowing what to expect.\n\n“I never thought I’d end up working in a submarine – and spending so many birthdays under water.”\n\nME3 Hari, who joined the navy in 2007 after graduating from ITE in Info-Communications Technology, recently returned from Kiel in Germany after a rigorous three-year training stint.\n\nThere, along with some 20 other navy personnel, he was trained to handle the new Invincible-class submarines, the last of which was launched in Kiel on April 22. The Singapore Navy has four submarines under the Invincible series.\n\nThere’s a certain mystery about submarines, I tell him – because no one ever sees them. He nods in agreement and tells me: “People ask me what it’s like in the submarine, and I just tell them, ‘Take your phone, put it outside, can you last one week without it?’\n\n“Then there’s having to work in tight spaces, so you can’t be claustrophobic.”\n\nME3 Hari declines – as per Navy regulations – to disclose how long he spent underwater during his training stint. But camaraderie with your crew members, he points out, is crucial.\n\n“That’s how we overcome everything. We do activities that look out for one another and to entertain ourselves, like challenging each other to do 100 push-ups and stuff like that.\n\n“And though there’s limited space, we find a way to exercise. There’s no gym on board, so even a tiny corner for our yoga mat would do,” he says.\n\nQuality-of-life improvements on the new submarines mean that naval officers now have built-in rice cookers, while crew members have their own beds instead of having to share bunks, which ME3 Hari is especially pleased about as he now has his own space to put up pictures of his family.\n\n“There’s a chef on board and he’s very good,” he assures. “The food is a huge morale booster, and the days when the crew gets chicken rice and laksa are quite special. We’re Singaporeans, so we must have our food lah.”\n\nA typical day on board the sub is split between six hours work and six hours of rest. ME3 Hari’s work deals with the ship’s sonar console, or what he refers to as the “eyes of the submarine”.\n\n“My daughter once asked me if the submarine had windows. I explained that we operate the submarines by sonar, by listening.\n\n“People who don’t know much about submarines think we can see outside, but you can’t, though we do have the periscope before we descend.”\n\nUsing advanced sonar systems, the submarine is capable of detecting all targets within its area of operations, ME3 Hari explains. The Underwater Warfare System Experts are able to “fingerprint” the target, well before it’s able to detect the submarine’s presence.\n\nAside from the sonar console, he also has to be adept with the manoeuvring control console, which, in simple terms, is the section that steers the boat.\n\n“The ship also has day-night lighting to acclimatise your eyes,” he says. “Red light denotes night.”\n\nMarried since 2013, ME3 Hari says he was fortunate enough to have his wife Malatthi and six-year-old daughter Sharvini with him in Germany.\n\nBoth wife and child picked up German during their stay, but not ME3 Hari – understandable as he was underwater most of the time.\n\n“It was a tough decision for me,” said Ms Malatthi, referring to the choice of relocating to Germany for three years upon her husband’s posting.\n\n“But when Hari was given a chance to go overseas, I took it as an opportunity for my family as well. Also, I wanted my daughter to have her father around during her prime growing up years.\n\n“I don’t think my daughter actually remembers what Singapore is like. She was just 16 months (when we left), so we actually had to tell her what National Day and Deepavali were.”\n\nSince he returned from Kiel last December, ME3 Hari has taken on the role of instructor at the navy training school at Changi Naval Base, where he teaches new submariners over a six-month course. “It’s a lot of theory and study before you qualify to get on board the submarine,” he says.\n\n“Then you go through months of training on a submarine to understand how a submarine works and how to operate the onboard systems.\n\n“It’s not important to know how to swim, although we will teach you that.”\n\nME3 Hariiheran Naidu with wife Malatthi and daughter Sharvini.\n\nPhotos: Mindef\n\n“People ask me what it’s like in the submarine, and I just tell them, ‘Take your phone, put it outside, can you last one week without it?’\n\n(Left) ME3 Hariiheran Naidu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/dcae2c0308d0e42eb45070e2e7be9c974824c807ed54fb21b9e8c6281ee4524c?w=825", "alt_text": "Military Expert 3 Hariiheran Naidu at the launch of the Inimitable in Kiel, Germany, on April 22, 2024."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndian football legend Sunil Chhetri is in elite company. Of those still playing, only Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentina’s Lionel Messi, with 128 and 106 respectively, have scored more international goals than him.\n\nBut the 39-year-old striker, who has 94 goals, said last week that, after 150 games for India, the June 6 World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Kolkata will be his last before retiring, reported NDTV.\n\n“It’s not that I was feeling tired,” said Chhetri, who had a short spell in the United States with the Major League Soccer Kansas City Wizards in 2010.\n\n“When the instinct came that this should be my last game, I thought about it a lot and eventually I came to this decision.”\n\nHe added: “The feel that I recollect in the last 19 years is a very nice combination of duty, pressure and immense joy.\n\n“Every training that I do with the national team, I just want to enjoy. The game against Kuwait demands pressure, we need the three points to qualify for the next round. It’s hugely important for us. But in a strange way, I don’t feel the pressure because these 15-20 days with the national team and the match against Kuwait is the last.\n\n“The retirement decision was not because of physical aspect, I am still fit, running, chasing, defending; the hard work is not difficult, the reason is to do with mental aspect.\n\n“I was fighting with myself, trying to think holistically, it came instinctively. One year I will be in Bengaluru FC, I don’t know how long I will be playing (domestic football), after that I want to take a sabbatical.\n\n“Will I be sad after this? Of course... the kid inside me never wants to stop if given a chance to play for his country.”\n\nWhen asked if he would consider coaching after his playing career, Chhetri said: “I will not say never, I will think during my sabbatical, but it’s not very high on my agenda as of now.”\n\nHis contract with the Indian Super League side is till next year.\n\nChhetri, who has won five domestic league championships, played his first game for India against Pakistan in 2005 and in the time since, his goals and leadership have helped the Blue Tigers become the dominant force in South Asia and a more visible presence at the continental level.\n\nIn 2010, he was named India’s captain. Under his captaincy, India won the 2012 Nehru Cup and four South Asian Football Federation Championships in 2011, 2015, 2021, and 2023.\n\nBefore his debut, India last appeared at the Asian Cup in 1984, but is now a regular participant after qualifying for the 2011, 2019 and 2023 tournaments.\n\nChhetri also helped the Indian national side make a rare appearance in the top 100 of FIFA’s rankings last July.\n\n“It will take some time before we get to see another footballer like Sunil Chhetri in India,” said former Indian striker I.M.

Both died of their injuries.\n\nBystanders rushed to help the victims and restrained Vedant, who along with one of his friends, tried to flee the scene.\n\nIn videos of the aftermath taken by passers-by and circulating on social media, the angry crowd is seen thrashing Vedant before handing him over to the police, India Today reported. Another person who was in the car reportedly escaped.\n\nThe police registered a case of manslaughter against the teenager.\n\nThe Juvenile Justice Board, a special court where minors are tried, granted him bail within 14 hours on several conditions, including working alongside traffic police for 15 days and writing a 300-word essay on the “effects of road accidents and their solution”.\n\nPolice on Tuesday arrested his father for giving the car to his underage son, who did not have a driving licence. They also arrested the owners of a couple of bars where the teen was served alcohol.\n\nAccording to Pune Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar, Vedant had been celebrating his class 12 results with friends at a few pubs and was drunk by the end of the evening.\n\nThe legal drinking age in Maharashtra is 25.\n\nThe incident has led to criticism of India’s legal system, with many social media users ridiculing the juvenile board’s ruling.\n\n“The court grants bail to the accused within a few hours and asks him to write an essay on the accident,” Ms Radhika Chaudhary said on X. “The Indian judiciary system applies differently to the rich and poor.”\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut demanded that Police Commissioner Kumar be dismissed, and claimed the teenager was served pizza and a burger at the police station after his detention.\n\nHe also accused a legislator from Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar’s National Congress Party faction of being present at the police station and helping the teen.\n\n“Pune Police helped a rich boy who took the lives of two young people... You’re serving him pizza and a burger for what? Now, video has surfaced that the boy was consuming alcohol. Everyone was aware of the reality, and still helped him,” Mr Raut said.\n\nMs Koshta’s family told CNN-News18 that they were dismayed by the bail conditions and were ready to fight at every level to get justice.\n\n“We are in shock,” said her uncle Sachin Bokde. “It is condemnable that he should get bail in 15 hours. He and his parents should be investigated.\n\n“We want his bail cancelled and he should remain in police custody. Because of him, an innocent girl, who has seen nothing of life, died.”\n\nLeader of opposition in the Maharashtra assembly Vijay Wadettiwar said: “How did the minor accused get access to alcohol? How did an unregistered car come on the road in Pune? Do bars and pubs open by breaking the rules? If so, why is there no action against them?\n\n“Why did it take so long to arrest the accused’s father knowing that he is a minor? That is why we demand a judicial inquiry into the said incident and also an inquiry into the Pune Police in this case.”\n\nOn Wednesday, after three days of outrage over the initial decision, the Juvenile Justice Board cancelled the teen’s bail and sent him to a juvenile detention centre until June 5.\n\nIt said a decision on whether he could be tried as an adult, which would see him face a more serious sentence, would be taken after further investigation.\n\nVideos of the aftermath show bystanders thrashing the driver, who tried to flee the scene.\n\n“Pune Police helped a rich boy who took the lives of two young people...

Kavi\n\nWhile many Indians would cite vadai as one of their favourite tea-time snacks, it seems the similarly shaped bagel is gaining some popularity among them too.\n\nEspecially since a Singaporean, Mr Hemant Mathy M S, is serving it up in Indian-inspired flavours such as butter chicken at The Bagel Bunch, located at The Metropolis in Buona Vista.\n\nA hankering to create something unique and with an Asian touch was what prompted the 28-year-old to start up a bagel shop that sells bagels with various Asian-inspired fillings.\n\nOriginating from Poland, bagels came along for the ride when European Jews began emigrating to the United States in the early 20th century. Today, it is eaten all across the US, and is especially popular in New York City as a breakfast option on-the-go.\n\nThe versatile dough goes well with several kinds of toppings, most notably salmon, cream cheese and smashed avocado.\n\nBagels have become trendy and popular among Singaporeans too, said Mr Hemant, a communications graduate from Nanyang Technological University. He started The Bagel Bunch as a home-based business in 2021 right after finishing school.\n\n“I always wanted to start a business and felt that bagels would be a good start to it,” he told tabla!\n\nHe pointed out, however, that bagels are a fairly time-consuming endeavour.\n\n“Baking a bagel is totally different from other breads. Each country has their own recipe and it has to maintain the crispy exterior and soft interior texture. It takes about 24 to 48 hours to make the bagels.\n\n“You mix the dry and wet ingredients, let the dough rest and start shaping it. After fermentation, you boil the bagel and bake it.\n\n“One of my favourite bagel flavours from my shop is the Butter Chicken Bonanza ($12.90). It has the balance of sweet butter chicken and spiced chicken, and also the raita which is a must-have in our Indian cuisine.”\n\nWhile one might expect the bagel to look reddish like a typical butter chicken dish, customers may be surprised to find that it looks more yellow than red. Nevertheless, after taking a bite, the strong flavours of the butter chicken and the spices are present, and well encapsulated in the bagel. The raita simply accentuates the flavour.\n\nAside from the Butter Chicken Bonanza, The Bagel Bunch serves other flavour combinations such as Korean Fried Chicken, ‘B.W.A.K’, which comprises a chunky slab of spicy chicken thigh, hashbrown, cheese, onion jam and pickles, and Lox of Love, made with smoked salmon, plum furikake, pickled red onions and tomatoes slathered in scallion cream cheese.\n\nMr Hemant said he’s always had a love for cooking and baking, but never had any formal training to become a baker.\n\nThe culinary business, however, runs in his blood, as his father used to be a chef. Part-time work as a barista over the years also gave Mr Hemant a glimpse into the F&B industry.\n\n“I relied only on YouTube videos, so it wasn’t easy at the start,” he said of his initial home-based bakery business.\n\n“Washing down the kitchen after baking, resetting the kitchen with my parents lamenting in the background about my cleanliness and getting the logistics done, really burnt me out.”\n\nOpening an actual stall earlier this month has made things easier, he said.\n\n“Over here at Bagel Bunch, all bagels are made from scratch and customers can smell the freshness of our bagels with the eggs frying at the side and bagels baking in the oven.”\n\nBy Anusha Selvamani", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/16fce71b46e144b1d686d4c546f6a16545cb262710c5a421b9273ce906c448f8?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Hemant Mathy M S at his shop, The Bagel Bunch, at The Metropolis in Buona Vista."}]}

And he will no doubt do so to his own rhythm and beat.”\n\nThe grace and poise of the occasion demonstrated the political balance that Singapore has found since the transition in 1990 from the nation’s founder Lee Kuan Yew to his successor Goh Chok Tong, who in 2004 left the country in the hands of a prime minister who is doing the same now to a person whom his fourth-generation (4G) peers view as the best person to lead Singapore.\n\nMuch is at stake in this handover.\n\nTestimony to (now) Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s economic leadership, Singapore’s domestic product per capita more than doubled from $46,664 in 2004 to $113,779 in 2023.\n\nA go-for-growth strategy was responsible for this remarkable transformation. However, growth comes at a price. Income gaps widened, creating public disquiet.\n\nThat led the Government to invest its energies in redistribution programmes such as ComCare, which was launched in 2005 to bring support schemes together; and Workfare in 2007 to top up the wages of lower-income workers.\n\nThe Progressive Wage Model was formulated to lift the wages of those at the bottom of the economic ladder, while MediShield Life and CareShield Life provided financial assurance for those who need long-term care.\n\nReflecting the democratic socialist principles that brought the People’s Action Party (PAP) to power in 1959, Singapore moved to the Left under Mr Lee.\n\nMr Wong will no doubt continue the process. He would have to balance the needs of the population – particularly its most economically vulnerable segments – with the national exigency of benefiting from globalisation, which seeks to create a single global market eventually.\n\nThe problem with globalisation is that it produces first-world, second-world and third-world economies within nations even as it integrates them without, by softening economic borders between them.\n\nNo political system can last for long if it is trifurcated economically.\n\nThe upcoming unemployment benefit scheme, the need for which the government previously dismissed, is an example of how the benefits of globalisation can be retained while addressing its downside, including unemployment caused by economic dislocation.\n\nIf the handover had a motif, it was the necessity of change within continuity.

The BMC said it does not allow billboards over 12m x 12m in size.\n\n“A case has been filed in this case as no permission had been given for the hoarding,” BMC Commissioner Bhushan Gagrani said.\n\n“A complaint was also received that some trees had been cut so this hoarding could be visible. We have filed a case in this regard too.”\n\nWhile Bhinde’s agency has claimed it received permission from the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Railways), BMC officials have said a nod from the municipal corporation is also necessary for all billboards in areas under its jurisdiction.\n\nMaharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has announced a compensation of Rs500,000 ($8,000) to the families of the people killed in the tragedy, and said the government will bear the cost of treatment for those who were injured.\n\nBhavesh Bhide", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/32dbb2f0400b786aae8da73ac0c22dab85d7c36fb55399c68637286bd32278d1?w=825", "alt_text": "The billboard that fell at a petrol station following a dust storm in Mumbai."}]}

But, after six months, when the family members tried to make him stand, he was unable to do so.\n\nLast February, when the boy was 20 months old, the Rajasthan Police launched a crowdfunding campaign for him that had a strict deadline – because the injection can be administered only when a child is two years old.\n\nThe campaign garnered support from cricketer Deepak Chahar and actor Sonu Sood, who posted appeals on social media.\n\nThe drive to collect money across Jaipur saw contributions from people from all walks of life, including fruit sellers, vegetable vendors and shopkeepers.\n\nVarious NGOs and social organisations also assisted the campaign.\n\nThis is the first time that crowdfunding on this scale took place in Rajasthan.\n\nWithin three months, Rs9 crore was collected and Hridayansh was given the injection at the JK Lone Hospital in Jaipur on Tuesday.\n\nDr Priyanshu Mathur, in-charge of the Rare Disease Unit at the hospital, and his team administered the injection, which was imported from the United States.\n\nThe remaining amount has to be deposited within a year in three installments.\n\nDr Mathur said: “Hridayansh’s parents approached doctors when he was not able to stand, though he reached the age when normally a child can do that. In the test, it was found that his leg muscles didn’t work properly.\n\n“Weak nerve cells near the spinal cord cause SMA. The condition will become more severe with age. This disease will also affect respiratory muscles. Consequently, the kid will suffer from pneumonia repeatedly.”\n\nLike Hridayansh, many parents in India cannot afford to buy Zolgensma and other SMA drugs.\n\nWhile there is no official data on the number of Indians with the disease, studies show that SMA affects nearly one in 10,000 newborn babies in the country.\n\nAccording to a study, one in 38 Indians are carriers of the faulty gene that causes SMA, compared with one in 50 people in the West.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service\n\nHridayansh Sharma\n\nPHOTO: IANS\n\nThis disease will also affect respiratory muscles.

This is the advice of audiologist Raja S, founder and managing director of Hyderabad-based Hearzap.\n\nHe points to five noises that can damage hearing:\n\nUnexpected explosions\n\nExplosions, like a car backfiring or a sonic boom, can be incredibly loud (often exceeding 140 decibels) and may even cause hearing damage. A normal conversation is only about 60 dB in comparison.\n\nFestivals and concerts\n\nTry to stay away from loudspeakers while attending a concert or festival. Carry earplugs and listen from a safe distance.\n\nHome improvement equipment\n\nPut on earplugs before the chainsaw or drill machine is plugged in. Such machines produce sounds higher than 90 dB.\n\nPersonal audio on high\n\nMany people crank up their headphones or earbuds to drown out background noise. However, listening to music above 60 per cent volume for extended periods can also damage hearing.\n\nBe mindful of the volume setting and consider using noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nHidden culprits\n\nEven some seemingly harmless places can emanate surprisingly loud noises. The noise at arcades, movie theatres and bowling alleys can all exceed safe listening levels. Be aware of your surroundings and take breaks from loud noises whenever possible.\n\n“Any time you encounter any sort of pain, get yourself tested immediately,” said Mr Raja.\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fb7380641f6ef9671a01e41dd33eea0671b82f142a63b9a960ae56e4431972a1?w=825", "alt_text": "Credit: IANS"}]}

He completed five out of six marathons within the last two years.\n\nBut it wasn’t just for personal glory; Ramesh, who is a partner at Allen and Gledhill law firm, ran to also raise funds for The Ashram, a halfway house run by the Hindu Endowments Board.\n\nAt the end of the six races, he raised $22,000 through the Giving.sg platform.\n\nThe journey was not without its twists, Ramesh told tabla!\n\nIn Boston, he had expected cold weather before his arrival on April 12. But he was surprised when the weather gradually turned before race day on April 15.\n\n“When I arrived it was cold, but leading up to the day of the race, the chilly weather was replaced by dry heat of 22 to 23 deg C,” he said.\n\n“I had to drink more than a litre of water daily before the marathon, to ensure a safe level of hydration,” he said, adding that during the previous five marathons, he ran in cooler temperatures.\n\nTaking place during Patriots’ Day, a state holiday in Massachusetts that commemorates the start of the American Revolution, Ramesh said the marathon comprised a host of fringe events such as food fairs, lending a unique festive vibe to the affair.\n\n“The entire town stopped for the marathon, with road closures and celebrations throughout,” he said.\n\nWeather aside, Ramesh pointed out that the Boston marathon was the toughest of the six majors because of its numerous upward slopes.\n\n“In order to train for the Boston marathon, I would suggest runners from Singapore to train at sloped areas such as Mount Faber, like what I did,” he said.\n\nRamesh said he was close to giving up on more than one occasion due to the unexpected heat and undulating route.\n\n“I was okay until the 27km mark. We entered a town called Newton, which is famous for its hills, 5km of rolling hills. The end of the stretch is known as ‘heartbreak hill’, which is the most difficult to ascend.\n\n“At the 33km mark, I was so tired that I thought I could not complete the race. Several runners dropped out at this point.”\n\nAt one point, one of the runners splashed cold water on his face to spur him on.\n\nThinking of the coveted medal waiting for him at the end, Ramesh endured his aching quadriceps and abdomen and pushed on till the end.\n\nBack home, Ramesh continues to be active with his running group, Thaaru Maaru Runners, which he co-founded in 2017 to encourage those in the Indian community to keep active.\n\nBeginning with just 40 runners, the group has grown to more than 1,500 members, having surged in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOther than just organising runs, the group also participates in fundraisers and mentorship programmes to help the Indian community.\n\nThe runners raised $90,000 through a charity run they organised in April 2022, when they were joined by Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam.\n\n“At the 33km mark, I was so tired that I thought I could not complete the race.

Pragmatic compromises are sought, and common ground found as much as possible.\n\nUnity is forged from diversity, said PM Wong. “It’s never about subtracting, but always about adding. It’s never about contracting, but always about expanding.”\n\nThis collective striving for unity saw Singaporeans through the Covid-19 pandemic, he noted.\n\nCalling it the “crisis of our generation”, he said the country responded effectively to the pandemic because of the trust among citizens.\n\n“The way we dealt with the crisis – together, saving lives and livelihoods – deepened our social capital, and made us a better and stronger people,” he said.\n\nThe pandemic, which PM Wong said was “a baptism of fire” for him and his team, reinforced his conviction that the Republic’s exceptional performance as a nation lies not in any single person or institution, but in how well it can work together as one Team Singapore.\n\nAs Singapore navigates a world that is in flux, PM Wong said his Government intends to strengthen partnerships near and far, and advance the country’s interests.\n\nA small country like Singapore “cannot escape powerful cross-currents” in a world of conflict and rivalry, where the great powers are competing to shape a new, yet undefined, global order, he said.\n\nPM Wong added that this transition – which is likely to stretch for years, if not decades – will be marked by geopolitical tensions, as well as protectionism and rampant nationalism everywhere.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nPM Wong with his wife Loo Tze Lui at the Istana.\n\nEPA-EFE\n\nResidents watching the swearing-in ceremony at an area near Yew Tee MRT station\n\n“We will find new ways to be more productive and innovative, and achieve a better balance where work is purposeful, and life is meaningful.”\n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2556d4ca66b7d389866e828403b37966d459cb8b023c97d890a9c41633f7f87f?w=825", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong with residents of Marsiling-Yee Tee GRC on May 15."}]}

They are necessary to keep the ship staffed and operational,” he said. “They’re the best responders on board the ship themselves.”\n\nWhile the ship is likely to be re-floated this week, it remains unclear when it will be able to make the 3.7km journey to the port, reported NDTV.\n\nAuthorities – and the crew – hope that the demolition will mark the beginning of the end of a long process that has left the 21 men on board trapped and cut off from the world, thousands of kilometres from their homes.\n\nBut for now, it remains unclear when they will be able to reunite with their families.\n\nThey have been unable to disembark because of visa restrictions, a lack of required shore passes and parallel ongoing investigations by the NTSB and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nMr Jim Lawrence, a spokesperson for the Dali’s owner Grace Ocean, recently told IANS that the Indian crew members are “in good spirits”.\n\n“In addition to performing normal duties on board the ship, they are also assisting with the investigations and with the ongoing salvage work,” he said.\n\nBut, according to Mr Joshua Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers’ Centre, a non-profit organisation that works to protect the rights of mariners, the crew has been left largely without communication with the outside world after their mobile phones were confiscated by the FBI as part of the investigation.\n\n“They can’t do any online banking. They can’t pay their bills at home. They don’t have any of their data or anyone’s contact information, so they’re really isolated right now,” Mr Messick said. “They can’t reach out to the folks they need to, or even look at pictures of their children before they go to sleep. It’s really a sad situation.”\n\nThe plight of the sailors also attracted the attention of the two unions representing them, the Singapore Maritime Officers’ Union and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen.\n\nIn a joint statement on May 11, the unions said that “morale has understandably dipped”, driven by an “unfounded fear of personal criminal liability” and emotional distress.\n\nThe statement also called for the “swift return” of the crew’s phones, noting that losing communication with family members is “causing significant hardship for crew members with young children at home”.\n\nMr Messwick said on Tuesday that, for the time being, the crew has been given SIM cards and temporary mobile phones without data.\n\nThey have also received care packages from various community groups and private individuals, which in recent weeks have included batches of Indian snacks and handmade quilts.\n\nMr Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, the Dali’s Singapore-based management company, told the BBC that the crew is “holding up well” and that company representatives dispatched to Baltimore have been “checking on them constantly, from day one”.\n\n“All their needs are being met to the best of our ability,” Mr Wilson said, adding that shipments of catered Indian food have been sent aboard to allow the cooks to rest. Various religious representatives, including Hindu priests, have been providing services and emotional support to those aboard.\n\nMr Wilson, however, said he was unable to provide a timeline for the crew to disembark.\n\nThe controlled demolition of a section of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on Monday.\n\nAFP", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7949d7c8ff16e2eeeba1010c8dab821cb0b5da42cb8f27cbaeb51bb0a59070dd?w=825", "alt_text": "Bishop Adam J.

Some might have noticed that the roof gutters have been repaired and new bird netting installed.\n\nReactions were mixed. Mr Clarence Chan, 48, said: “It’s definitely brighter, cleaner and more inviting.”\n\nHowever, his 14-year-old son was unimpressed: “Doesn’t look like very much has changed.”\n\nMadam Tan Mei Lin, 75, a retiree, also complained that there were no significant improvements – unlike in 2016, when the place went through a previous overhaul.\n\nHer friend was quick to interrupt: “Aiyah, that one was a major renovation. Remember, it took about 18 months and they even set up a temporary food centre near the bus terminal.”\n\nThere was no argument, however, that “deep cleaning” had been carried out. The floor, tables and the even ceiling looked well-scrubbed.\n\nWhile only about two-thirds of the stalls were reopened, the crowd did not seem to mind and many stallholders were kept busy throughout the day.\n\nStill, you could easily identify the stalls that were sorely missed.\n\nThere were no less than a dozen customers queuing up for thosai and appam at the popular Heavens stall for the most part of the morning.\n\nThere were also lengthy queues at the carrot cake, fried kway teow and roti prata stalls.\n\nAt one table, a group of retirees looked contented nursing their kopi and teh while sharing stories on how they coped with the closure of their favourite hawker centre.\n\n“I would go to the coffee shop in the mornings, but it’s small and got very crowded very fast,” one of the elderly men complained.\n\nLike many others, he and his “kakis” were pleased there is no longer a 20 cent charge for using the spruced-up toilets.\n\nBusiness was similarly brisk at the adjoining Ghim Moh Market and customers looked happy to be back at their favourite grocers.\n\nYes, all is normal again at Ghim Moh.\n\nHowever, with the reopening of the market and food centre, the two nearby coffee shops were a lot less crowded.\n\nLike they say: You win some, you lose some.\n\nBy Khush Randhawa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f85add9887df1b8cb3b6bc739e8df00fd3d351c09de887ec3a7ddad646a65fd2?w=825", "alt_text": "The renovated Ghim Moh Road Market and Food Centre."}]}

Little known is that it also has a thriving regional film industry, which is churning out hits, as seen last year by the Oscar-winning Telugu film RRR.\n\nOften the country’s independent filmmakers are overshadowed by mega production houses, but they are increasingly making their presence felt, thanks to the accessibility offered by streaming services.\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival, which began on Tuesday, has recognised this shift. Its 77th edition will see an Indian entry in almost every major section during the 12-day event.\n\nNever before in history has Cannes and its sidebars found space for eight Indian, or India-themed, films. As many as six of these will be in contention for awards, reported Businessline.\n\nIndian cinema’s previous best at Cannes was in 2013, when it sent five films to various sections. In 2012, too, India had a substantial presence with four titles.\n\nBut for many years before and since, the pickings have been dishearteningly slender.\n\nOne notable aspect of the Indian films in Cannes this year is that they are all either helmed by female directors or are women-centric, with the exception of one.\n\nIn what could herald a new era, these films, made by directors endowed with sensibilities and approaches entirely their own, have shaken off the shadow of the gangster genre.\n\nFor the first time in 30 years, an Indian film will compete for the coveted Palme d’Or, reported India Today.\n\nPayal Kapadia’s All We Imagine As Light is up against films by cinema great Francis Ford Coppola (Megalopolis), Palme d’Or veteran David Cronenberg (The Shrouds) and Oscar nominee Yorgos Lanthimos (Kinds of Kindness), among others.\n\nThe Malayalam film follows two nurses in Mumbai who, troubled by their relationships, decide to take a road trip to a beach town where they find a space to manifest all their dreams.\n\nOnly one Indian film has won the Palme d’Or before, in 1946. Chetan Anand’s Neecha Nagar, which explored the gulf between the rich and poor, was an adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s 1902 play The Lower Depths.\n\nIndian-British filmmaker Sandhya Suri’s Santosh is in the running for an award in the Un Certain Regard section, reported Pinkvilla.\n\nAnother entry is The Shameless, an Indian story told by Bulgarian director Konstantin Bojanov, featuring a mix of Indian and Nepali actors.\n\nThe story follows two women whose bond develops into a forbidden romance, sending them on a journey of trying to escape their circumstances.\n\nChidananda S Naik’s Sunflowers Were the First Ones to Know… is in the La Cinef competition for film school entries.\n\nMysuru-based Naik is a qualified doctor. After graduating from medical college, he practised for some time before enrolling in a one-year course in the television wing of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). Sunflowers was Naik’s final television film at the institute.\n\nLa Cinef has Indian filmmaker Mansi Maheshwari representing the UK. The Meerut-born animation director is in the line-up with Bunnyhood, a self-reflexive graduation film made at the National Film and Television School (NFTS) in London. Maheshwari is a 2024 NFTS graduate.\n\nKaran Kandhari’s Sister Midnight, an India-British noir drama starring acclaimed actress Radhika Apte, is in the Directors’ Fortnight selection. The film will vie for the inaugural Quinzaine des Cineastes People’s Choice Award.\n\nThere’s also Maisam Ali’s In Retreat, screening at L’Acid, a space dedicated to independent cinema.\n\nSet in the picturesque Ladakh, it tells the story of a middle-aged man trying to return home to a mountain town for his brother’s funeral.\n\n“I didn’t know the director was young, because when you see the film, it’s incredibly deep, really mature,” Pamela Varela, one of L’Acid’s programmers told the New York Times.\n\nThen there is the Hindi film Kooki, which narrates the trauma of a 16-year-old rape survivor who feels let down by the judicial system. Directed by Pranab J. Deka, the movie – from Assam – also gives an insight into the culture of the region.\n\nRounding off India’s presence in Cannes this year is a 4K restored version of Shyam Benegal’s 1976 crowdfunded film Manthan.\n\nThierry Fremaux, the artistic director of Cannes, noted the new generations of filmmakers in India when he announced the line-up in April.\n\nThese movies offer what critic Namrata Joshi calls “a young, probing and provoking gaze at Indian reality”.\n\nWhen the festival winds down on May 25, the media contingent from the world’s largest film-producing nation might, fingers crossed, have plenty to write home about.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/50451428fea3c9520095c2200dd563fcb29189cfb7bb0d7774388a1a27f11db9?w=825", "alt_text": "Sandhya Suri’s Santosh, starring Shahana Goswami, is in the running for an award at the Cannes Film Festival 2024."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nOne-person shows seem to be catching on at the Singapore Theatre Company (STC), previously known as Singapore Repertory Theatre.\n\nAfter the success of Grounded by George Brant in March, and Taha by Palestinian actor Amer Hlelel last month, the STC is set to stage its third such show this year with Paradise Or The Impermanence Of Ice Cream.\n\nStarring New Zealand-based Indian Jacob Rajan, the play has Mumbai as the backdrop and will run from May 16 to 26.\n\nIt is the first time that the STC is doing three one-person shows in a row in a year.\n\n“These one-person shows are proving to be popular with our audiences and we thought why not get Rajan to perform here,” said STC’s artistic director Gaurav Kripalani. “We have an appealing story, and I would rate Rajan as one of the best actors in the world.”\n\nInspired by Ernest Becker’s Pulitzer prize-winning book The Denial Of Death, the play follows the afterlife of Kutisar, a man who tries to avoid death by reliving his past, where a rebellious young woman holds the key to his salvation.\n\nAs he grapples with past transgressions, he navigates into the real-life mystery that’s gravely affecting Parsi death rituals – India’s vanishing vultures.\n\n“Paradise Or The Impermanence Of Ice Cream is a delightful show that features exquisite puppetry, inspired sound design and a dash of Bollywood disco,” said Kripalani.\n\n“Rajan channels seven characters, and in the show, love, ice cream and the mysteries of death intertwine in unexpected ways.”\n\nOne-man shows are a slight departure from STC’s goal to get the best actors in the world to work with Singaporeans in big productions. But Kripalani believes it is important to be fresh and try something different and exciting as competition mounts.\n\n“When we started 30 years ago, we wanted to differentiate ourselves,” he said. “We said we were going to do an international repertoire of work with Asian actors.\n\n“When I took over as artistic director in 2001, I wanted a change. I wanted Singaporeans to work with the best actors in the world. We have such a wonderful pool of talent here and we were able to do big productions.\n\n“We then had a calling card and could fly the Singapore flag around the world. But then competition got a lot hotter and Covid hit.”\n\nKripalani pointed out that the going became became difficult because the competition was not just within theatre.\n\n“We’re competing with Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars, who take up a lot of people’s expendable income,” he said. “But I think our biggest competition post Covid is Netflix.\n\n“People got so comfortable watching great entertainment on their sofas. Why would they leave the house?\n\n“That I think is our biggest challenge. We spent years building up an audience base. I do feel we have taken a few steps back.”\n\nSo, Kripalani and the team at STC are enticing audiences to come back by reminding them that television and film will never give them the same experience live theatre does.\n\n“Sitting in a theatre is a communal activity,” he said. “You are surrounded by people who are experiencing the same emotions as you. It is a cathartic feeling that you will never get from television or films.”\n\nHas STC hit a jackpot with one-man shows? Is it the way forward?\n\n“It’s been really well received. So, we might do that on a regular basis,” said Kripalani.\n\nGaurav Kripalani\n\nPHOTOS: STC\n\n“We’re competing with Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars, who take up a lot of people’s expendable income.”\n\nSTC’s artistic director \nGaurav Kripalani", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/656a9f989a279cc2879d5c38042de6168f07edce058ece0f7b9eb1520967e941?w=825", "alt_text": "Jacob Rajan in Paradise Or The Impermanence Of Ice Cream."}]}

In fact, workers from the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) had to rescue it from being run over.\n\nIn February, Singaporeans rejoiced when wildlife photographers spotted a new baby in a troop of critically endangered Raffles’ banded langurs in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.\n\nA month before that, a couple filmed several rare sambar deer foraging along the Bukit Timah Expressway.\n\nOur otters were even featured in the new BBC Earth documentary series Mammals.\n\nNot all interactions between wildlife and humans have been peaceful.\n\nOtters have been known to raid koi ponds, monkeys help themselves to foodstuffs in kitchens and monitor lizards make themselves comfortable in secluded corners in homes.\n\nMembers of the Urban Wildlife Working Group (UWG) receive an average of 2,500 calls every month from the public. These are often complaints.\n\nAttributing this to a lack of understanding about our native wildlife, UWG members and its partners launched the Our Wild Neighbours initiative in April 2022 to promote coexistence with native wildlife.\n\nFrankly, the animals are paying a heavier price in the continuing urbanisation of Singapore.\n\nWhile Acres were able to save the python mentioned earlier, The Straits Times reported that about 20 pangolins, on average, were killed on roads annually from 2021 to 2023. This is a significant increase from the yearly average of around four cases in the previous three years.\n\nFortunately, attitudes towards wildlife are shifting.\n\nBritish producer Lydia Baines, here to produce the episode on otters, said: “Most people in Singapore cherish and look after the otters. You have people making sure they cross the roads safely. That is one of the most beautiful wildlife interactions I have come across.”\n\nMammals’ producer Scott Alexander says it succinctly: “We are the most successful mammal on the planet, and as such, we hold the future of our fellow mammals in our hands.”\n\nDo note that making room for wildlife does not extend to feeding them.

If a (sexual) act is committed (by a man) with his wife, not below the age of fifteen years, then the consent of the wife becomes immaterial. (In this case), marital rape has not been recognised so far,” the judge said.\n\nIndia’s Supreme Court increased marital consent from the age of 15 to 18 in a landmark judgement in 2017.\n\nThe woman also accused her in-laws of mental and physical harassment “on account of non-fulfilment of demand of dowry”, the court order said.\n\nA trial is pending.\n\nJudge Ahluwalia’s remarks have once again raised questions over India’s treatment of women, who continue to face the threat of violence and discrimination in the deeply patriarchal society.\n\nThe world’s largest democracy of 1.4 billion has made significant strides in enacting laws to better safeguard women, but lawyers and campaigners say its reluctance to criminalize marital rape leaves women without adequate protection.\n\nLawyer Indira Jaising, who is among several advocates fighting to outlaw rape within marriage, said “many women will benefit” if the exception is struck down.\n\nShe called for the courts to address the issue as a matter of urgency.\n\n“The crime has been invisible. Today these women have nowhere to go,” she said.\n\n“Fast-tracking the case will send a message to everyone that violence against women matters.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/india/judge-dismisses-case-unnatural-sex-between-spouses?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

There were also a handful who voiced their own indignation about his plight.\n\nHailing from Tamil Nadu, Mr Senthilmurugan’s late grandfather P. Govindasamy began distributing newspapers in Holland Village in the 1940s.\n\nHis father Govindasamy Periathambi then set up shop there in the late 70s. It sold sweets, knick-knacks and newspapers.\n\nBusiness thrived early on as the Holland Village area was home to many British servicemen and their families, who often requested for magazines from their homeland.\n\nIn the early 90s, when his father fell ill, Mr Senthilmurugan took over the business. He renamed it Thambi Magazine Store in honour of his father.\n\nAt its peak, the store offered about 7,000 magazine titles. Over time, and with the advent of the Internet, the number dwindled to about 1,000.\n\nLast weekend, he shut up shop for the final time after his landlords had asked him to remove the outdoor shelves and confine business activities to the shop interior – as part of plans to revamp the entire area.\n\nMr Senthilmurugan said doing so would defeat his shop’s tradition of having an open display or a “magazine cave”.\n\nWhen asked what his plans were, he said: “I have spent more time with my magazines than with my family and my children. So this feels like my baby has died. (But) this is only a break until I set up the next place.”\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Senthilmurugan said he will continue to work as a vendor, distributing newspapers. If he does set up shop again, he hopes for a place that would at least allow for a display rack.\n\n“My father used to put plastic sheets onto the racks. But I discontinued the practice as I wanted potential customers to feel and flip through the magazines.\n\n“If you offer me a place in Orchard Road or Changi Airport, I would not want it. I’m a kampung boy, I’ve played with soil and sand, and this is where I have seen three generations of people.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/91959edae239f651a317ddc76c2c751341d084bafe311f361058940365c66d06?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Periathambi Senthilmurugan as he drew down the shutters of his Thambi Magazine Store in Holland Village on May 5."}]}

A tattoo parlour, bars and nightclubs, art and crafts shops and tailors who made army uniforms and apparel, dotted the shop houses at Holland Village.\n\nSam also recalled the open-air cinema that specialised in Chinese movies, which was popular among the local residents. The theatre was created by arranging rows of benches each rented for 50 cents per show. It closed in 1985.\n\nHe spoke of a playground on a hilltop where the new One Holland Village mall now stands, and cycling with friends around the area.\n\nHe listed the lengthy repertoire of shops and eateries in the area, including Fitzpatrick’s Supermarket (later replaced by Cold Storage), Fosters Steakhouse, and pubs such as Balmoral and Kingsford – outlets that gave the village a cosmopolitan feel, almost like a mini Orchard Road.\n\nThere was also the Kampong Holland Mosque that used to rely on donations from worshippers to build a prayer hall slightly bigger than a five-room flat. The mosque held its last Friday prayer in 2014.\n\nModernity has led to a spanking new mall (One Holland Village opened in December 2023) replete with newgen eateries serving Japanese and fusion cuisines, and shops centered around several courtyards – to give the place an open feel and atmosphere.\n\nLocated a stone’s throw from Holland Village MRT station, the mall distinguishes itself as a pet-friendly locale, with water fountains and elevators dedicated to pets, as well as poop bag dispensers and “pet parking’ stations with leash hooks. Not to mention the more than 20 eateries and stores pets can actually enter.\n\n“This place was so different from when I was growing up,” Sam said.\n\n“It was a happening place that had a real kampung feel to it, and I miss the social part of everything. Back then, customers wouldn’t just pay and go, they would stay and chat for a while.\n\n“There used to be handicraft stalls and vendors selling wallets and knick-knacks in the open spaces. I remember when the NEA officers came by, the vendors would all pack up and scatter.\n\n“Now everyone’s gone for good – and I’m the last to go.”\n\nMr Periathambi Senthilmurugan greeting customers who visited the store in droves last weekend.\n\nPHOTO: T.

Santosh Kumar\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansali, regarded as one of the best filmmakers in India, has come up with an epic drama series, Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, which premiered on Netflix on May 1.\n\nThe show, set in pre-Independence India, is based on the lives of courtesans in the red light district of Lahore’s Heera Mandi.\n\nNetflix describes the eight-episode drama as “an epic saga of love, power, revenge and freedom”, and a “passion project” that Bhansali has worked on for some 14 years.\n\nStarring Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Shaikh, Aditi Rao Hydari and Sharmin Segal Mehta, the series also marks the return of Fardeen Khan.\n\nBhansali’s pet project is based on Moin Beg’s novel and focuses on a group of women – each with rather distinct personalities – in an era where Nawabs fund brothels, each having a nautch girl reserved for their daily entertainment, even as their wives lead lonely lives in their palaces.\n\nThe screenplay is detailed and patient, with each female character having a tragic back story that ultimately weaves itself into the main plot.\n\nAs Bhansali spins an intricate tale of power, greed, lust and love, he also understands that there are only shades of grey to every story; nothing is completely black or completely white.\n\nThe familiar elements of a Bhansali film are present – the grandeur, the drama and opulent sets, all amid a universe that only Bhansali –  best known for Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) and Devdas (2002) and acclaimed for his use of aesthetics, musical vision and period dramas – can create.\n\nThe show also has some terrific performances from its leading ladies.\n\nAs a review on wionews.com puts it, Sonakshi Sinha, who plays the calculative and conniving Fareedan, is a delight to watch as she shows her versatility as an actor.\n\nComplementing her is Manisha Koirala who adopts a deep baritone to play the menacing, controlling Mallika Jaan for whom power is above all kinds of familial bonding.\n\nKoirala and Bhansali collaborate after two long decades since their last outing Khamoshi, which launched the director’s career back in 1996.\n\nAccording to livemint.com, many netizens have been effusive in their praise of the series, calling Heeramandi a masterclass on camera movement and mise-en-scene.\n\nOne netizen, Aayush Sharma, wrote: “Heeramandi is a mesmerizing saga that pays homage to the unsung heroes of history. Bhansali ensures that his narrative reaches a wider audience while maintaining his signature cinematic flair. Manisha Koirala and Aditi Rao Hydari steal the show.”\n\nHowever, there were few who found the show a bit of a snooze fest, undoubtedly because of the slow pacing.\n\nAbhijit Iyer-Mitra took to X and wrote: “Could anyone get past the first 15 minutes of #Heeramandi? I mean, great sets, but two songs within 15 mins and no plot in sight.”\n\nHeeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar\n\nis streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe cast of Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar.\n\nPHOTO: NETFLIX", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6ff8d024b9938803a0d03acbb5b9f90b59fefa8f93305becd9dc05069389a255?w=825", "alt_text": "The cast of Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar."}]}

Today, the firm also supplies security guards to venues and events.\n\nBut every so often, the 62-year-old welcomes customers in the form of husband and wife – when one wishes to know if the other is cheating.\n\n“Studies have shown that the test is about 90 to 92 per cent accurate. Basically, if a person is lying it would pick it up easily,” Ron tells tabla!\n\n“We get matrimonial cases many times. Wife suspects husband, husband suspects wife. Rarely do people pass,” he adds with a laugh.\n\nWhile polygraph exams cannot be used as evidence in Singaporean courts, they are widely used by law enforcement agencies here. In cases lacking evidence, polygraphs can aid law enforcers in decision-making.\n\nAt SecuriState, these tests cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000, depending on the case. While the bulk of his polygraph cases involve cheating spouses, many also come from employers doing pre-hiring checks.\n\nBefore getting hooked up to the polygraph machine, Ron says he does a pre-test interview lasting 30 minutes with the client, to go through the facts of the case and formulate his questions. This allows him to read a person – through body language, eyes and tone – and get a sense of whether he or she may be telling the truth.\n\n“During the polygraph test, there’s an average of 10 questions, out of which three will be important questions pertaining to the case,” Ron says.\n\n“Another four will be unimportant questions such as ‘are you now in an office?’ And then there are the control questions like ‘Did you lie to anyone in the past year?’\n\nWhat the polygraph does, Ron explains, is measure the pulse, heart rate, blood pressure and breathing cycles – much like in the hospital monitors.\n\nThere are instances, of course, of people trying to “cheat the polygraph”.\n\nRon cites one recent example – a woman sent by a company for a pre-hire screening for an analyst job.\n\n“One of my questions was whether she had ever passed information via computers or took information back home. And she started employing countermeasures. She was tightening her anus.\n\n“So I stopped the test and asked her why she was doing so. She asked me: ‘you mean can see (on the reading)?’ I told her, yes of course I can.\n\n“I failed her and wrote a report back to the company saying she was deceptive.”\n\nCurious after hearing about the techniques employed and the ability to suss out deception, I ask Ron to test me.\n\nRon is reluctant.\n\n“There must be an element of threat,” he explains. “For example, if I ask you, in the past one year, did you abuse anyone, verbal or physical?”\n\nI look up to my left, and think for two seconds before answering.\n\nBut he interrupts.\n\n“See that question made you think, you’re looking out there. If the element of threat is present during the session, I can see if the person is hiding the truth.”\n\n“What is your phone number?” he asks me.\n\nWhen I rattle the number off, he says: “See you looked straight, you never looked up or down. Your eyes are moving to the part of the brain where the answer is. And your answer was immediate, no latency. You were trying to give me the correct number.\n\n“Have you noticed people saying: ‘err, you mean my phone number?’ They’re buying time. So when people repeat your question, they may be – it’s not always the case, of course – hiding information or lying.”\n\nWait, so I was hiding information earlier about abusing someone?\n\nBefore I can process that thought, Ron explains the polygraph’s one flaw, and perhaps why its results are still inadmissible in a court of law – the degree of inaccuracy, or bias, which the polygrapher can manipulate.\n\n“I can make a person pass or fail. I was once offered $5,000 to help this guy pass the polygraph test,” he says.\n\n“Even with the machine, the important thing is the examiner. He must also be experienced in detecting countermeasures.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bfb3c04f0bc6ea28255d1fa76ed89040eeab77479ba42cc037d0d5f73af70cce?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Malaravan Ponniah, managing director of security firm SecuriState."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTwo supporters of cricket in Singapore, the Singapore Indian Association (SGIA) and Ceylon Sports Club, (CSC) have come together to launch a cricket league that will give more than 1,500 players the opportunity to indulge in their favourite sport during the weekends.\n\nThe Balestier Premier League (BPL) will be played in T20, T25, T30 and T35 formats at the SGIA and CSC grounds.\n\nIt will have 56 teams, with a separate league for corporate sides. The league is open to all players, who can play as club or corporate teams.\n\n“Both clubs have produced top cricketers and hockey players who have represented the national teams over the years,” said Mr S. Chandra Das, adviser to SGIA and a former MP, during the launch of the BPL at SGIA on May 5.\n\n“The league will bring the community together and many players will get opportunities to showcase their talents.”\n\nThe organisers have also developed an app that will have all the tournament information, making it easier for officials to conduct the matches and fans to follow the scores and highlights.\n\nThe SGIA has its own Premier League, which kicked off last year. Teams which play in the SGIA league are not allowed to play in the BPL.\n\nThe Singapore Cricket Association also has its own league, which started on May 5 for this season. It will mainly be played at the Singapore Cricket Club ground in Dempsey and the new cricket-specific facility that SCA is developing in West Coast.\n\nIn the past, private entities used to organise their own leagues, apart from the SCA league. But that has stopped because it has become expensive for them to use land on lease.\n\n“Not many cricketers are getting a chance to play matches because of a lack of grounds. So we thought we will do the BPL so more of them can play, and there will be cricket for them throughout the year,” said CSC patron Chelva Rajah.\n\nThe competition will be tough, said Sudhanshu Gupta, captain of the Grab team, who will play in the T30 (corporate) league.\n\n“But it will give us an opportunity to bond, learn and grow. Our aim is to enjoy and find happiness through this league.”\n\nPlayers from different states in India, who are living in Singapore, are slated to be part of teams that are playing in the BPL.\n\n“Cricket is a uniting force and players from Bihar and Jharkhand are playing together in the tournament,” said Jitesh Singh, captain of the Bijhar Dabangs team.  “We play in the T25 edition and want to showcase our talents.”\n\n“The league will bring the community together and many players will get opportunities to showcase their talents.”\n\nMr S.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe founding family of the 127-year-old US$5 billion ($6.8 billion) Godrej Group has agreed to split the conglomerate.\n\nMr Adi Godrej and his brother Nadir will retain ownership of Godrej Industries, which includes five listed firms. Their cousins Jamshyd Godrej and Smita Crishna will take over the unlisted Godrej & Boyce and its affiliates, reported Reuters.\n\nThis split represents a division between two branches of the founding family. Mr Adi, 82, and Mr Nadir, 73, will lead one side, while Mr Jamshyd, 75, and Ms Smita Crishna, 74, will oversee the other, as outlined in a statement released by the group.\n\nThe rationale behind this split, according to the family’s statement, is described as an “ownership realignment” of their shareholdings in the Godrej companies.\n\n“The realignment has been arrived at in a respectful and mindful way to maintain harmony and to better align ownership in acknowledgement of the differing visions of the Godrej family members. This will help maximise strategic direction, focus and agility and will accelerate the process of creating long-term value for shareholders and all other stakeholders,” the statement read.\n\nThe division was agreed upon to honour the differing viewpoints within the family over business strategies, especially among the younger generation.\n\nThere have been no apparent undercurrents despite the differences, reported NDTV.\n\nThe two factions of the Godrej family have historically owned shares in various companies within the group and served on each other’s boards. However, to facilitate a clean separation, they have decided to transfer their equity interests after resigning from their respective board positions.\n\nSome family members may still own a small number of shares in the other family’s companies, but they will not have special privileges as owners.\n\nThe iconic business group began as a lock company and later produced the world’s first vegetable oil soap under the brand name Chaabi (meaning “the key” in Hindi).\n\nAccording to the company, the separation will help maximise strategic direction, focus, agility and accelerate the process of creating long-term value for shareholders and all other stakeholders.\n\n“Godrej was founded in 1897 to help build economic independence for India,” Mr Nadir said. “This deep purpose of innovating for a cause – the values of trust and respect and the belief in trusteeship and making communities that the companies operate in stronger and better – continue to form the bedrock of who we are 127 years later.\n\n“We look forward to building on this legacy with focus and agility.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/041d3d27f09cdd3561963596b474849e7ea14ae7317a0bc1e94234b86ff583e4?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Nadir Godrej."}]}

So, developers and real estate companies are complimenting the project by creating the ancillaries – houses, condos, even roads as well,” he explains.\n\nNRI One hosts property expos every month in various parts of the world, says Mr Sharma.\n\nIn addition to Singapore, it has a presence in the UAE, Bahrain, Hong Kong and in major cities in the United States.\n\nWhen it held its first expo here in November 2022, just after the Covid-19 pandemic, there were 11 real estate developers on show. Today, that number has risen to just over 30.\n\n“Singapore is a very India-friendly country, and because of its proximity to India, it’s a good market for Indian real estate,” Mr Sharma says.\n\n“Many Indians living here, I would say belong to the upward mobility segment, with disposable income and a good amount of savings. Indian real estate is the shining star in the world of investment. Then there is also the (favourable) currency difference that factors into their buying decisions.\n\n“Every Indian living abroad wants to have some kind of connection with India. Having a place in your motherland makes a difference. It’s an emotional connection.”\n\nI wasn’t sure if it was that very emotional connection that led me back to the Goa property sales booth, where a billboard displayed the tagline “G.O.A – great opportunity arrives”.\n\nMr Mehta notices me loitering about once again.\n\n“If you have any family in India, you can purchase a home in their name,” he says. “Or perhaps you can marry an Indian.”\n\nRight. Now if only there was a “world’s biggest Indian matchmaking event” at the Marina Bay Sands.\n\n“Singapore is a very India-friendly country, and because of its proximity to India, it’s a good market for Indian real estate.”\n\nMr Gaurav Sharma, director of NRI One", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ad2829f4ec3571e62cd186a97a983a8b300bd61b6a7bdaa54ab02c51552891c5?w=825", "alt_text": "The booth for real estate developers Excellaa, who were marketing condos in “new neighbourhoods” in Hyderabad, at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre on April 27."}]}

He has more than 50 million followers across social media platforms.\n\nBorn in Delhi, Badshah, whose real name is Aditya Prateek Singh Sisodia, is also a songwriter and music producer.\n\nHis style is diverse, encompassing pop, hip-hop, rap, synthwave, underground rap, pop rap and hardcore rap music. He has sung in Hindi, English, Punjabi and Harayanvi.\n\nRaised in a middle-class Punjabi home, Badshah embodies the quintessential rags-to-riches dream, becoming one of the most successful generational artists while building a culturally rich empire that has made him one of the most bankable names in the Indian music industry.\n\nIn 2021, he released a colossal hit “Jugnu”, which was supplementarily used by YouTube for the launch of YT Shorts, making him the world’s second artist after BTS to get this unique sync.\n\nHe premiered another smash hit thereafter in a collaboration with Internet sensation Sahdev Dirdo on “Bachpan Ka Pyaar”, which climbed to the No. 1 spot on the Global YouTube Music Videos Chart.\n\nThe Indian rapper also collaborated with Mikey McCleary on the celebratory song “Bachke Rehna Re Baba” for the Netflix action film Red Notice.\n\nIn 2023, he grabbed headlines with sold-out shows in Wembley’s OVO Arena and First Direct Arena as part of his debut UK tour.\n\nFrom a decade-spanning music career with over 500 stadium shows, his contributions have undoubtedly propelled him to a league of his own.\n\nHis string of film credits include Kapoor & Sons, Sultan, Dabanng, Dhakaad, Veere Di Wedding, Saaho and Shivaay.\n\nWith a long-term vision to take Indian music to western audiences, Badshah has collaborated with global heavyweights such as J Balvin, Tainy, Sean Paul, Major Lazer, Diplo, Tiesto and Lil Baby.\n\nHis ability to fuse contemporary production with traditional Indian soundscapes to create anthemic and experimental records has helped him garner admiration, respect and an unparalleled fandom among artists, stakeholders and audiences throughout the vast diaspora of Indian and South Asian communities across the world.\n\nFollowing the success of his third studio album Ek Tha Raja, which features stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Arijit Singh, Divine, Karan Aujla and Norah Fatehi, Badshah will be playing at multiple arenas in the United States, Canada and Singapore between May and June this year to support his new album.\n\nEk Tha Raja is currently one of the top five albums in India on Spotify and Apple, and one of the top five global albums on Spotify.\n\nThe show in Singapore is organised by VZ Solutionz, a premier event and concert organising company.\n\nThe opening acts will feature DJ Mass, Flint J, Yung Raja and Romaine Willis, while KP Sandhu will be the host.\n\nTickets can be purchased at sistic.com.sg\n\nBadshah Live in Singapore\n\nMay 11 at Expo Hall 5", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/124c534e1d434b6ed310edd512acd88c5b9077b785b8527a76620570694e2955?w=825", "alt_text": "Gear up for an electrifying night as Badshah, the king of Indian rap and pop."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives will be called Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Lives from the upcoming third season.\n\nWhat else is new about the Netflix reality series?\n\n“It has added three new wives to the mix, all from Delhi,” said Neelam Kothari Soni, a former actress who starred in the series’ first two seasons.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who currently manages her family’s jewellery business in Mumbai, was in Singapore last week for a promo event to talk more about the series and what fans can look forward to in the new season.\n\nShe was accompanied by the series’ other heroines Maheep Kapoor, Seema Sajdeh and Bhavana Pandey during the three-hour event with about 250 people – predominantly women – at the Sofitel Sentosa ballroom on April 25.\n\nAfter the series started off well, with people curious to know about the lives the four lead characters, it fell somewhat flat last season, with critics finding them boring and vacuous.\n\nFabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives focuses on the personal and professional lives of the four celebrities who live in Mumbai – the wives of actors Samir Soni, Sanjay Kapoor, Chunky Pandey and Sohail Khan (who Seema recently divorced).\n\nIt debuted on Nov 27, 2020, on Netflix, with a second season premiering on Sept 2, 2022.\n\n“Fans love our show but we wanted to give them more,” said Neelam, who revealed that the reality series is not scripted.\n\n“So in the new season, we will step out of our comfort zone and face off with Delhi’s best-known divas.”\n\nThe additions from Delhi are Riddhima Kapoor Sahni (wife of businessman Bharat Sahni and sister of Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor), Shalini Passi (wife of Pasco Group chairman Sanjay Passi) and Kalyani Saha Chawla (ex-wife of luxury retailer Ravissant’s Vishal Chawla).\n\n“Season 3 will be entertaining, funny, emotional, dramatic, over the top… but at the heart of it all, it remains an exploration of the many facets of friendship. The bond we share are special,” said Maheep.\n\nFrom lavish parties to business ventures, the two seasons, produced by Karan Johar, gave a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the opulent lifestyles that the wives lead.\n\nThe series had candid interviews, intimate moments and dramatic encounters.\n\nWithout an actual script, Bhavana explained it was up to the actors to decide what to discuss and “whether to fight or cry”.\n\nSeema said some situations are slightly planned, but that it’s up to the four to decide how the episode pans out.\n\nPakistani Fauzia Razi, who has been living in Singapore for 20 years and is in the clothing and jewellery business, said the show is interesting because the four talk about various topics like botox and sex, which makes it easier for most people to talk about subjects like that later.\n\n“I can now relate to them because I have seen them in front of my eyes,” she said.\n\nMs Deepika Thakur, a housewife from Delhi, is a huge fan of the show, but found the second season a bit dull.\n\n“I can see that the series needs a lift,” she said. “In Season 3 (for which the start date is yet to be announced)  I can see they are not going to hold back. There is sure to be anger, spice, fights and new vibes and surprises.”\n\nFor organiser Jinny Nevatia from Advaita Events, the event was an opportunity to gauge if the four wives had any sway in Singapore.\n\n“Indian jewellery brand Tanishq came aboard as the main sponsor and there were 250 screaming women wanting to take selfies with them. So, I think there is a market for such Bollywood shows in Singapore,” said Jinny.\n\n(From left)  Neelam Kothari Soni, Bhavana Pandey, Maheep Kapoor  and Seema Sajdeh in Singapore last week.\n\nPhoto: VHOK JOHN/ ADVAITA EVENTS", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/dbc4cd2255eadeb6dbcab43b1f66a53afa4a23aca843b956d3b5bc1c0426f423?w=825", "alt_text": "(From left)  Neelam Kothari Soni, Bhavana Pandey, Maheep Kapoor  and Seema Sajdeh in Singapore last week."}]}

I love durian anything – cakes or puffs or whatever.\n\n“I grew up very Singaporean, even my dad was very Singaporean. He lived here for over 20 years after university in Japan, so he was super cultured in that sense, and probably the least ‘French person’ I knew; he even spoke with a Singlish accent, just like I do.”\n\nIn 2016, Amita’s father, Eric, died in a workplace accident at age 51. Vacations to France were an annual tradition for the family before the incident, but in recent years, Amita along with her mum and three siblings, have visited the old country just once every few years.\n\nHer paternal grandparents Guy and Danielle, who are in their 80s, live in a “vyeh-ree” small village in Lyon, Amita says in a playful demonstration of her French accent. She is set for a reunion with them when she heads to Paris to compete in the Olympics from July 26 to Aug 11 – her second outing in the multi-sport showpiece.\n\nA sociology graduate from the University of Notre Dame in the United States, where she competed in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) tournaments for the past four years, Amita is articulate as she tells me about her preparations for the Olympics, acknowledging as well the expectation that she is among the Republic’s best hopes for a medal in Paris.\n\nIn her Games debut at Tokyo 2020, she suffered an opening-round exit in the women’s foil at the hands of eventual gold medallist Lee Kiefer of the US, whom Amita regards as her hero.\n\n“I work well with pressure. Competing in the NCAA helped a lot with that – it was just a different kind of adrenaline,” says the three-time champion at the South-east Asia (SEA) Games who secured her ticket to Paris via ranking points.\n\nRanked 28th in the world and seventh in Asia in the women’s foil, she claimed crucial points at the Grand Prix in Washington DC earlier this year by finishing joint-20th.\n\n“During my qualifying bout (in DC), I was trailing 12-14 and the referee was against me. But I stayed calm and told myself: ‘I am going to win this’. And I did (15-14). I realised if I could win that difficult bout, anything is possible.”\n\nHer stint in the US, where she trained under renowned fencing coach Amgad Khazbak, has been a successful one by some measure.\n\nAs part of the Notre Dame fencing team, she won the NCAA Fencing Championships team title in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn 2022, she was named the Women’s Foil Athlete of the Year by the United States Fencing Coaches Association.\n\nAnd last year, Amita claimed a historic bronze at the Asian Fencing Championships in Wuxi, China, before reaching the quarter-finals at the Asian Games in Hangzhou.\n\nKhazbak will not be in Amita’s corner in Paris, as he also works with Kiefer during major competitions. For that reason, she has returned home to work with national foil head coach Oleg Matseichuk.\n\n“I was reluctant to return here to train initially, because I was very comfortable in the US and I didn’t want to change that up so soon before the Olympics.\n\n“But I also needed a coach that would be there for me – and I knew Oleg could offer that. I like the camaraderie that we have.”\n\nMatseichuk, from Ukraine, and Amita didn’t take long to hit it off, she says, before impersonating her coach – “Hyelo Amita” – with perfect intonation and inflection.\n\nBy now, it’s clear that aside from fencing, Amita also has a flair for accents. And that while she engages in a sport of a duelling nature, when her foil mask is off, she’s one of the most disarming and gregarious people you’ll meet.\n\nBut just how did she come to pick up the sport?\n\nI cite an article from a few years ago that quotes her saying it was the Zorro movies that sparked her interest, after being enthralled by Antonio Banderas’ character.\n\nAmita laughs this off.\n\n“I think I mentioned Zorro to the reporter and he wrote it the way he did. But the truth is, I was really into football when I was in (Raffles Girls’ Primary School), but the school didn’t have that as a CCA (co-curricular activity) at the time.\n\n“Then one day, I was with my sister (Aarya) at United Square and we chanced upon a fencing school, Z Fencing, and we stepped in to give it a shot. The coaches there told our parents that we were naturals – though I’m not sure if it was just to get us to sign up. But the rest, as they say, is history.”\n\nThe youngest in the family, Amita comes from a sporting household: Eric did judo and was a football and Formula One fanatic, her mother Uma was an athlete (she is now a teacher), while her elder siblings Ashok, 34, and Aishwarya, 31 – finance professionals in London and New York respectively – played hockey and netball at school level.\n\nAarya, 25, also went on to become a national fencer for a brief period, and was a regular sparring partner for Amita up until recently. She is now a lawyer at a local firm.\n\n“I’m actually very close to my family even though we all live apart,” says Amita, who, in preparation for the Olympics, trains twice a day and resides at the Singapore Sports School.\n\n“During this period though, I’ve barely been able to see anyone. The one time I had a day off and where I actually saw people was during Vishu (Malayali New Year; April 14) when I went to my grandma’s house.\n\n“It’s been rough, but my family and close friends are very understanding, they know what my focus is for this period.”\n\nTowards the end of the dinner, as Amita crunches on her last papadum for the evening, I ask the million-dollar question: Is there a boyfriend in the mix?\n\n“No,” she says. “But I think it’s because I measure everyone up to see if they compare with my dad – and so that’s why no one ever seems good enough.\n\n“But whoever comes along doesn’t have to love fencing. He just has to be supportive of me.”\n\nFencer Amita Berthier tucking into her meal at Samy’s Curry.\n\nPhotos: Sundara Nataraaj, Lianhe Zaobao\n\n“I love my prata, my char kway teow, oh, and durians.

Santosh Kumar\n\nKarnataka will investigate a lawmaker whose party is a key ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on suspicion of sexual harassment, the state’s chief minister has said.\n\nThe scion of a prominent political family, Member of Parliament Prajwal Revanna, 33, is the grandson of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, the nephew of a former chief minister of the state and the son of another former Karnataka minister.\n\nThe accusations surfaced last week as half of the state voted in India’s seven-phase general elections, in which Mr Prajwal was seeking a second term for his Janata Dal (Secular) party.\n\n“The government has decided to form a special investigation team in connection with Prajwal Revanna’s obscene video case,” Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, whose Congress party is a BJP rival, said in a social media post.\n\n“Obscene video clips are circulating... where it appears that women have been sexually assaulted.”\n\nThe police registered a report against Mr Prajwal based on the statement of a woman who worked in the family home, and also named his father H.D. Revanna as a suspect, the media said.\n\nMr Prajwal is reportedly out of the country. Denying the allegations, he said he has informed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that he is currently not in Bengaluru, but will join the probe soon.\n\n“As I am not in Bengaluru to attend the inquiry, I have communicated to CID through my advocate. Truth will prevail soon,” he said in a post on X.\n\nHis father told reporters on April 29 that his son would return when required. The same day, the JD (S) party announced it was suspending Mr Prajwal.\n\nThousands of videos allegedly showing the MP sexually abusing women are circulating in Karnataka, sparking outrage.\n\nThe allegations against Mr Prajwal first came to light in June last year, but he obtained a court order preventing the media from reporting what was described as “morphed videos”.\n\nBut five days before the April 26 voting in Hassan – from where Mr Prajwal is the MP and seeking another term – thousands of pen drives were circulated in public places such as bus stands and parks.\n\nThe clips, which reports said were shot by Mr Prajwal himself, showed the faces of the women he had allegedly abused.\n\nFollowing a complaint from a woman, Karnataka’s women’s commission chief Nagalakshmi Chaudhary wrote to the state police chief seeking action against the perpetrators.\n\n“Your blood boils when you see some of the videos,” she told the BBC. “There is one woman who is begging... ‘please don’t, please don’t’. You feel sick.”\n\nOn April 28, a 47-year-old woman, who worked as a cook for the family and identified herself as a cousin of Mr Prajwal’s mother, filed a police report alleging she was sexually abused by the MP and his father.\n\n“When I joined, six other maids would say they were scared of Prajwal. The male employees, too, would ask us to be wary of Revanna and his son Prajwal,” she said in her report.\n\n“Whenever his wife was away, Revanna would repeatedly touch me inappropriately, disrobe me and sexually assault me. While I was working in the kitchen, Prajwal would grope me from behind.”\n\nThe woman claimed she decided to step forward after watching clips of other victims online.\n\nShe also accused Mr Prajwal of abusing her daughter, and his father of stalking and criminal intimidation.\n\nThe case has sparked a political storm in Karnataka, with many questioning how someone “accused of such a horrific act” was permitted to leave the country without questioning.\n\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah accused the Congress government in Karnataka of not taking any action over the obscene clips.\n\n“The government is of Congress party. Why they have not taken any action till now?” asked Mr Shah.\n\nSenior JD (S) leader and former state minister G.T. Deve Gowda said it would take disciplinary action against the two men if the charges were proven.\n\nReuters\n\n“Your blood boils when you see some of the videos.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMahavir Janm Kalyanak is one of the most significant religious festivals for Jains worldwide. It commemorates the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, the 24th tirthankara.\n\nJainism, also known as Jain Dharma, is an Indian religion which traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of 24 tirthankaras (supreme preachers of Dharma).\n\nOn the auspicious occasion (April 27), the Singapore Jain Religious Society (SJRS) held an event titled SJRS Got Talent at the PGP Hall, which was attended by more than 600 guests, including Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah, Singapore Indian Development Association CEO Anbarasu Rajendran and Revered Saint Saman Shrutapragyaji, founder of the Peace of Mind Foundation and a spiritual mentor.\n\nIn her speech, Ms Indranee, the guest of honour, noted: “The first Jains arrived in Singapore around 1910. Then there were only a handful, and now your community has grown to over 2,000. I am indeed honoured to attend this celebration.”\n\nFollowing the Jain principles of eating within sunrise and sunset, the event started with a Jain dinner following a Talent Show.\n\nThe celebrations started with the sthapna (commemoration) of Bhagwan Mahavir. SJRS members led the procession with diyas (lamps), ghadas (earthen pots traditionally carried on the head) and dandiyas (sticks used in traditional Gujarati dance).\n\nThe rest of the programme included dances, song and a skit.\n\nOne highlight was the melodious rendition of Jain bhajans (songs) in a qawali (sufi music) form by the SJRS’ women’s wing.\n\nAnother was a dance titled “Ratnakar Panchisi” where the performers told the story of a king who was deeply attached to a bag of gems. Upon realising his folly, the king repented and crafted 25 stutis (songs) that the performers showcased through a Kathak dance.\n\nThe SJRS also launched its very own band, Goonj, whose members play the cajon, flute, keyboard, guitar and violin.\n\n“It is heartwarming to see the talents we have in our Jain community”, said SJRS president Kenal Kothari.\n\n“I wish to thank all our well-wishers for their greetings and particularly from the Vatican (the Catholic church) whose message started with ‘may this feast bring abundant blessings, happiness, peace and unity to your families and communities’.”\n\n“The first Jains arrived in Singapore around 1910.

My hawker centre is closed\n\nUPDATED\n\nMay 3, 2024, 5:30 AM\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nThere is ample evidence that residents in the neighbourhood are suffering withdrawal symptoms with the closure of the Ghim Moh Road Food Centre. It will be shuttered from March 1 to May 10 for renovation. That’s more than two months.\n\nWhen I mentioned the hawker centre closure in a WhatsApp call to a former neighbour who migrated to the United Kingdom, he asked anxiously: “What are you going to do?” I ignorantly brushed it aside, saying: “There are many alternatives.”\n\nI was so wrong. Nothing it seems can replace your favourite hawker centre – even temporarily.\n\nThe familiar faces that were always present at the hawker centre are now seen loitering about, often wearing sad expressions as they look at the closed locale.\n\nAfter all, in December 2020, hawker culture in Singapore was officially added to the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Even the United Nations acknowledged just how important these centres are to Singaporeans.\n\nWhile there are options for affordable food, there are few alternatives for the folksy ambience of your regular hawker centre. Many of us have our favourite table when interacting with our “kakis” – a Singlish term, derived from a Malay word “kaki” for leg, that also means a close friend.\n\nA poll by the National Environment Agency in 2018 found that 83 per cent of Singaporeans eat at hawker centres at least once a week. Since one-third of Singaporeans dine out more than seven times a week, that surely means multiple visits to hawker centres.\n\nIn a Perception Survey of Hawker Centre Patrons in 2019, an astounding 99 per cent of the 1,103 respondents said they were satisfied with the affordability of food options in hawker centres.\n\nThen, shattering the common perception that hawker centres are generally hot and dirty, 87 per cent expressed satisfaction with their cleanliness, hygiene and ventilation.\n\nHawker centres have even become tourist attractions. Think of Newton hawker centre and Lau Pa Sat.\n\nThere is even a tour to explore – and taste – the many flavours of local hawker centres with an expert guide.\n\nTour promoters probably drew inspiration from retirees who occasionally venture to hawker centres outside their neighbourhood to try out a famous dish.\n\n“With the MRT, even the nasi lemak at Changi Food Centre is easily accessible,” said a 70-year-old uncle, as retirees are affectionately known. “But I’m missing Ghim Moh hawker centre a lot.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ff66c4b700ff4f5524c90b8b5c890ac712c1ddcb6a1e6fd2474d9420b409ab65?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Paul, a former human-resources executive at Foxconn India, told the news agency that the company’s executives verbally convey the recruitment rules to its Indian hiring agencies, which Foxconn tasks with scouting candidates, bringing them in for interviews and employing them.\n\nFoxconn typically doesn’t hire married women because of “cultural issues and societal pressures”, said Mr Paul, who left the company in August 2023 for a better-paying role at a consulting firm.\n\nThe company’s view was that there were “many issues post-marriage,” Mr Paul added. Among them: Women “have babies after marriage”. “Risk factors increase when you hire married women,” he said.\n\nReuters’ investigation team reported that two sisters in their 20s, Ms Parvathi and Ms Janaki, had gone to the Sriperumbudur plant for interviews in March 2023 after seeing job ads on WhatsApp. But they were turned away at the main gate by a security officer who asked: “Are you married?”\n\n“We didn’t get the jobs as we both are married,” Ms Parvathi  told Reuters. “Even the autorickshaw driver who took us from the bus stand to the Foxconn facility told us they wouldn’t take married women. We thought we would still give it a shot.”\n\nReuters also spoke to five other women who said they were rejected by Foxconn’s hiring vendors on the grounds that they were married.\n\nMs Priya Darshini, who is in her late 20s, received the news in a WhatsApp group chat, which a recruiter from SS Enterprises had created to scout for candidates.\n\nShe posed questions to the group in August 2023, according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters: “I have a baby. Are there child care facilities? Could I bring my baby? Age is 2. Salary?”\n\nThe recruiter, Mr T. Balu, sent a curt reply: “Married not allowed.”\n\nAsked about his response, Mr Balu told Reuters that Foxconn does not hire married women who wear ornaments because it wants to ensure a metal-free zone.\n\nMr Paul said the Foxconn management advises its hiring vendors not to mention marital and age criteria in their job ads. But in some instances vendors did not heed that advice.\n\n“Job vacancy for Only Female … iPhone Manufacturing … Age: 19 to 30 Unmarried,” said an ad posted by a recruiter at Proodle, a hiring agency for Foxconn, in a publicly accessible WhatsApp group in February 2024.\n\nA YouTube ad for Foxconn jobs posted by recruiter Cumans Manpower in July last year sought “unmarried only” female candidates aged 18 to 28.\n\nNone of the hiring agencies identified by Reuters responded to questions about the job ads and employment practices at the Foxconn plant.\n\nIn response to questions from Reuters, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged lapses in hiring practices in 2022 and said they had worked to address the issues. All the discriminatory practices documented by Reuters at the Sriperumbudur plant, however, took place in 2023 and 2024. The companies didn’t address those instances.\n\nApple told Reuters it upholds the “highest supply chain standards in the industry,” and noted that Foxconn employs some married women in India\n\nIn a statement, Foxconn said it “vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status, gender, religion or any other form.”\n\nHowever, the exposure of the factory’s hiring practices turns a new spotlight on one of the highest-profile foreign investments in India.\n\nApple, Foxconn and other big companies play a key role in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s imperative of removing societal impediments that prevent many Indian women from getting jobs.\n\nWhile Foxconn employs thousands of women in India, discrimination on the basis of marital status risks undercutting Mr Modi’s aims.\n\nFor some Indian women, a job making iPhones is a ticket out of extreme poverty. The Foxconn positions offer food and accommodation and a monthly cheque of about Rs16,690 ($270), roughly in line with India’s per capita GDP.\n\nSuch jobs are the kind of opportunities offered by multinational companies that the government has encouraged to help lift living standards.\n\nReuters\n\nA job ad posted on YouTube by recruiter Cumans Manpower in July 2023 sought applications from only unmarried women.\n\nPhoto: Screenshot of Cumans ad via YouTube\n\n“We didn’t get the jobs as we both are married.

The 16-year-old’s parents then took her to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), where they received some shocking news.\n\nThe diagnosis was infective endocarditis, a rare bacterial infection that causes abscesses and vegetations around the heart valves.\n\nAshwini soon found herself in the hospital’s operating theatre, where she underwent a 12-hour open-heart surgery.\n\nThe experience, she said, left her with both physical and emotional scars, including one that stretches from her chest to her collarbone.\n\nShe told tabla: “I don’t worry about what others think. People accept tattoos; they should view my scar the same way.”\n\nAshwini was not fully aware of her condition before her surgery. Her parents, worried about the risks involved, as outlined by the doctors, chose not to inform her – “they wanted to protect me from the dread”.\n\nDr Charmaine Chan, a consultant in cardiology with KKH hospital, explained: “When a person is affected by infective endocarditis, bacteria enter the bloodstream and attach to a damaged part of the heart lining or valves, forming vegetations.\n\n“In Ashwini’s case, a large vegetation on her mitral valve caused significant damage and holes in her valve, as well as abscess around the valve.”\n\nDr Chan added that infective endocarditis is not a common condition among children, especially those without a history of congenital heart disease. Cases of infective endocarditis that require surgery are rarer, she said, with just three cases over the last 10 years.\n\nAshwini recalled waking from the surgery with tubes in her nose, mouth and urinary tract.\n\n“I was unable to talk for two days, I had to type out words to speak to my parents,” she said. “I had to have a glucose drip for three weeks before I could finally drink something.”\n\nIt was only while recovering from surgery that Ashwini learnt of her situation, when the surgeon explained it to her.\n\n“Until then, I thought that I had undergone only a stomach procedure. I was just blank with shock when I heard the news,” she said.\n\nAfter weeks of post-surgery rehab and a significant loss of study time, Ashwini was determined not to delay her O’Level examinations. “I didn’t want my situation to hold me back. Regardless of my exam results, I was eager to move forward,” she said.\n\nThough she did not secure a place in a mass communications course at a polytechnic as she had hoped, Ashwini enrolled in a criminology diploma programme at Kaplan University.\n\nNow almost a year since the surgery, Ashwini is determined to move on. While she can’t partake in vigorous physical activities, she goes for regular walks to ease herself into normal life. Engaging in community service also helps her relax.\n\nDoctors have informed her that, despite surviving the surgery, there remained ongoing risks. Her situation has been described to her as a “ticking time bomb,” suggesting a likelihood of future complications or the need for additional medical interventions.\n\n“Recently, I was admitted to the hospital again – for just a slight pain in the chest. This is what I have to live with – anticipation and caution,” she said.\n\n“But the aftermath of the surgery has made me stronger and weaker in different ways.  I remind myself that it’s okay to feel scared or insecure and that the feeling will pass.”\n\n“I don’t worry about what others think. People accept tattoos; they should view my scar the same way.”\n\nAshwini Thirupathi (right)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/af279b07f39e63b919847ecf671ebb5d0fc04aca007d5e434405e1ba1733c46a?w=825", "alt_text": "Ashwini Thirupathi"}]}

Following her passing, he took over the business, running it successfully for 20 more years before relocating to his current stall at the wet market in Bedok 85 Fengshan Centre.\n\nHe has since been running the stall with his wife for another 20 years.\n\nReflecting on the current state of the trade, Mrs Ajarah expressed a sense of loss.\n\n“This profession is dying as people’s preferences are changing with the times. Young people these days are not interested in such jobs,” she lamented. “Even our own children do not want to take up this business.”\n\nShe pointed out that today’s youth cherish their freedom, which is why few are willing to pursue the spice mixing business, where taking even a day off is unheard of.\n\nDespite all these challenges, Mr Allah emphasised that it’s important to preserve this unadulterated traditional craft for future generations. “We must not let it die.”\n\n“This business has seen us through many significant moments in our lives, such as buying a house, a vehicle and educating our children,” he said.\n\nThe couple remains committed to their trade, driven by the appreciation of their loyal customers.\n\n“Along with Indians, Chinese and Malays also buy our spice blends regularly. Even foreigners come to our stall from time to time,” Mrs Ajarah said with pride.\n\n“As long as there are folks who appreciate what we do, we’ll continue doing it for as long as we can.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a49bc37eef2f2204ed4419ab9849f8c4c52df44988cc975fb15a96ad3874fdc1?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Allah Pichai and his wife Mrs Ajarah Beebi at their stall in Bedok 85 Fengshan Centre."}]}

The sum almost matches the Rs2,400 fans paid for the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan in September 2023.\n\nThe surge in advance bookings has overwhelmed the ticket-booking platform BookMyShow, causing it to crash in Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka due to the high demand.\n\nDirected by Nag Ashwin, Kalki 2898 AD is a mythological sci-fi film produced by Ashwini Dutt’s Vyjayanthi Movies, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\nThe film gained international acclaim when its teaser premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con last year.\n\nRecently, filmmaker Karan Johar shared the film’s second trailer on his Instagram handle and wrote: “The grandest spectacle of the big screen awaits...packed with powerful and glorious performances by my favourite artists in the industry. I cannot wait for this to be unleashed to all!!!!”\n\nTelugu auteur S.S. Rajamouli, who also directed Prabhas in two blockbusters Baahubali & Baahubali: The Beginning, also gave a shoutout.\n\n“Power packed trailer it is,” he said. “It sets the right mood and tone to watch the film. Amitabh ji, Darling (Prabhas) and Deepika’s characters seem to have a lot of depth and are truly intriguing.”\n\nSet in a dystopian future, Kalki is about three individuals fighting to save the world from a great evil entity. It features Amitabh as the immortal Ashwatthama, an immortal character from ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, and Prabhas as Bhairava, an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu.\n\nThe storyline is about the wealthy living in luxury within The Complex, a massive mega-city structure in the shape of an inverted pyramid that towers over Kasi. Those outside face harsh realities and aspire to make it into Kasi. A hidden refuge, Shambala, offers shelter for people from all cultures and religions.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Kalki is the 10th and final incarnation of the god Vishnu who appears in order to end the Kali Yuga, the darkest period in mankind’s history, reported The Times of India.\n\nThe action drama marks the Telugu debut of Bollywood stars Deepika and Amitabh and their first collaboration with Telugu superstar Prabhas. It also features Tamil cinema legend Kamal and Bengali actor Saswata Chatterjee as antagonists.\n\n“It’s been a truly wonderful experience to have worked in a setup where they’ve actually gone beyond thinking what most of us have been doing all our lives in the film industry,” Amitabh said. “And I really appreciate the fact that we’re moving a little ahead of times, and making us a part of that and making us work in conditions that we never thought we would be able to work.”\n\nKamal, who plays the antagonist Supreme Yaskin, said: “I always wanted to play the bad man because the bad man gets to do all the good things in the film, when heroes are singing romantic songs and waiting for the heroine, where you can just go and do what you want.”\n\nHeavily pregnant Deepika, who is due in September and plays a pregnant character named Sumathi, said: “It’s been a great learning experience. A completely new world and we went through different phases of discovering what this movie is all about. The magic that is in Nagi’s (Ashwin) head is now here finally for everyone to see.”\n\nPrabhas, who plays the protagonist Bhairava, said that working with his co-stars and a production of this scale was “bigger than a dream.”\n\nWhile a budget for the film has not been officially revealed, Variety reported that it is in the region of Rs600 crore ($97 million). If correct, that would make it one of the most expensive Indian films of all time.\n\nThe film, which released in Telugu and Hindi with dubbed versions in Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and English and in a variety of formats including 3D, 4DX and IMAX, is expected to make a grand opening at the box office.\n\nAccording to trade website Sacnilk, it could be the third Indian film (behind RRR and Baahubali 2) to “take the opening of Rs200 crores at the worldwide box office on June 27”.\n\nSacnilk posted: “Kalki 2898 AD is expected to take the opening of R120-140 crore gross in India. In Telugu states (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), the movie is expected to open in the range of Rs90-100 crore. In North India, it is expected to take Rs20 crore, while Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are likely to give a Rs15+ crore start.”\n\n“It’s been a truly wonderful experience to have worked in a setup where they’ve actually gone beyond thinking what most of us have been doing all our lives in the film industry,”\n\nAmitabh Bachchan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f5585096e000a4a17ca0b3f47782128d6265dc2b92038c10c5f3ebb0fbea4eb3?w=825", "alt_text": "Deepika Padukone, Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan in a Kalki poster."}]}

However, the family miraculously survived the crash and was rescued from the mangled car.\n\nMs Neha admitted that her husband drove the car off the cliff intentionally but testified later that she did not want him prosecuted.\n\nAccording to doctors, Mr Patel was suffering from schizoaffective disorder and a major depressive disorder.\n\n“He had been hearing footsteps and thought he was being followed in the weeks before the crash.

Ambedkar in Origin, with director Ava DuVernay during shooting in Georgia, United States.\n\nPhoto: @GAURAVJPATHANI2/X\n\nWhen filmmaker Ava DuVernay read Isabel Wilkerson’s 2020 book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, she was so stunned that she reread it twice.\n\nThe bestselling book draws a line between India’s caste system, the hierarchies of Nazi Germany and the historic subjugation of the black people in the United States, reported The wire.\n\n“It took me a really long time to wrap my mind around the idea that there’s something underneath racism that’s called caste,” DuVernay says. “It doesn’t mean racism doesn’t exist. It means the foundation, the root, the origin, underneath is the very simple premise – someone has to be better than someone else.”\n\nDuVernay was warned that caste was too complex to adapt into a film but with each reading she felt a story emerge more clearly. Her new movie Origin, which released in Singapore on June 13, centres on Wilkerson, played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, as she explores how understanding the caste system can deepen our understanding of what black people experience in America. DuVernay describes it as “a film about a woman in pursuit of an idea”.\n\nThrough this 150-minute movie, DuVernay, known for her Oscar nominated Selma (2014) tries to establish a compelling and convincing link between caste discrimination in India, racial apartheid in America and the persecution of Jews in Germany.\n\nIt features Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, an Indian jurist, political leader and social reformer, who founded Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha (Society for Welfare of the Ostracised) and led social movements such as Mahad Satyagraha in 1927 to demand justice and equal access to public resources for the historically oppressed castes of Indian society.\n\nGaurav Pathania, assistant professor of sociology at Easter Mennonite University in Virginia, plays the role of Dr Ambedkar.\n\nIn one scene, Wilkerson is shown opening The Annihilation of Caste, an undelivered speech written in 1936 by Dr Ambedkar. as she tries to find answers to a range of questions that hit her after she learns of the death of a young black man, Treyvon Martin, who was killed in 2012 for merely walking in a white neighbourhood.\n\nThis shatters her to the core. She instantly decides to understand the root cause of racism and its nuances in the US. In her quest, she travels to Germany and India as well.\n\nOrigin underlines how caste is an intrinsic factor in a developing country like India where there still continues an inhuman practice of manual scavenging: Dalits (untouchables) enter a manhole full of human excreta without any protection and only the oil on their body.\n\nThe director uses Dr Ambedkar’s original voice and his opinion on endogamy (the custom of marrying only within a local community) as a preserver of caste very succinctly to make a point. He is shown in various avatars – as a student at Columbia university, in New York and during the Mahad Satyagraha.  But his screen presence is limited and he has no dialogues.\n\nIn the US, the movie has received rave reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and has been appreciated for the incredible performance of the lead actor and unique storytelling by the director.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8863230c53980fc28b7900ee8143d378138b6123a6879ff4a1702d4e2a1e85e9?w=825", "alt_text": "Assistant Professor Gaurav Pathania (right), who acts as Dr B.R.

Royal screened MGR movies while Diamond was Sivaji’s domain.\n\nOccasionally, rival fans, intoxicated by more than just the cinematic experience, would indulge in theatrics of their own outside the cinema hall, their punches and flying kicks rivalled only by what they had witnessed minutes earlier.\n\nDad decided we didn’t need to hang around for the sequel, so we made a beeline for the bustop.\n\nIn time, we didn’t have to travel to the city to watch movies.\n\nMovies came to us when Venus and Golden City cinemas opened near our Margaret Drive home in Queenstown, shortly after Singapore’s independence in 1965.\n\nFor what was then a princely sum of 50 cents, I watched Tarzan swinging through the trees in his loincloth, Benhur racing a chariot of horses around a Roman ring and Mary Poppins flying through the air with an umbrella.\n\nIn 1972, life imitated art when the notorious gangster Lim Ban Lim, who had killed a policeman, was himself gunned down by the cops near Golden City. It was curtains for Lim.\n\nFor the rest of us, life and the movies went on.\n\nAcross from my old school in Bras Basah Road was the Capitol cinema where I watched Dracula starring Christopher Lee who played the timeless vampire.\n\nSchoolboys would regularly visit the cinema as there were student discounts in those days.\n\nGrowing up, I also frequented the old Lido cinema, Orchard cinema, the Odeon theatre in North Bridge Road and Prince theatre in Beach Road where I watched John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever with a group of NS buddies.\n\nThere was also a kampong theatre I went to occasionally called Starlight in Pasir Panjang where I watched the Beatles in Hard Day’s Night while seated on a bench.\n\nThe movies I will never forget though are Gandhi, The Godfather, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Exorcist and All The President’s Men, which inspired me to become a journalist.\n\nWhen I was dating my wife Chitra, I introduced her to fish head curry and Freddy Krueger, a bogeyman character who slashed his victims to death with knives for fingers,  in A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nShe wasn’t amused. The fish head definitely left a bigger impression on her than did Freddy.\n\nWhen the kids came along, we took them to The Lion King, Jurassic Park and the entire Harry Potter series.\n\nThey’ve since left the nest, but we still go to the movies together as we did last Sunday when we went to Lido to watch Origin, a controversial movie about caste.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever tire of going to the cinema and I’m glad that seniors like me can get a discount on weekdays.\n\nWatching a movie at home may be a great experience for many but for me, nothing beats watching it in a cinema hall while sipping a coke and munching on my popcorn. \n\nLong may the Force be with me...", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3f41a9fc9f360b0d632b893ff4c275cbf24093a3985fa12c146a24756f9a3fd7?w=825", "alt_text": "The Cathay Building near Waterloo Street which was built in 1939."}]}

Singapore is just way too perfect, and we thought it’s making her soft. Unfortunately we also had forgotten what the Indian chaos feels like... turns out we have also become soft.”\n\nMr Dharmadhikari has touched on a point that is extremely important for Singapore. The Republic might not be “just way too perfect”, but it does come close to that ideal in terms of the efficiency and probity with which the Government conducts the affairs of the nation, the high standards of delivery of public services and other expectations that people have of life in advanced nations.\n\nSingapore has made the transition from Third World to First in a way that few could have foretold. Given its paucity of  natural resources, Singapore has been able to achieve so much since its independence in 1965 because it is what I can only call a “willed nation lying within a destinarian state”.\n\nThere was no Singapore nation in 1965 but only a largely plural society (one in which race corresponded with economic function). The nation was willed into being by the economic imagination of its founding fathers, who sought to provide  every citizen a common social stake in a fledgling country.\n\nTo do that,  they adopted a political destination: that of Singapore as a successful state. Carrying the willed nation on its back, that destinarian state crossed one milestone after another on the international highway to success.\n\nWhat helped was the ability of Singapore’s political and administrative leadership to put nation above ethnic and partisan self, and the energetic approval of voters for severe laws and powerful institutions that made it possible for an island city-state to adopt a globalising strategy of survival and success.\n\nThe willed nation residing in a destinarian state did not signify softness but its opposite. That opposite was embodied in the belief of the leadership that the world did not owe Singapore a living. Singapore must progress or perish.\n\nI arrived in that Singapore from India in 1984. Mr Dharmadhikari would have arrived in 2017 in a very different Singapore. Hence his concerns that his daughter might be spoilt by the ample comfort zone provided by this country. Hence his desire to give her a reality check by way of introducing her to the “uncertainties of life” in India.\n\nI wish the family well, but I do not think that the Singapore-India binary holds true. That is because both countries are part of a single international trajectory in which the competitiveness of nations is decided by impersonal and extra-national forces that take no interest in geographical borders. Globalisation does not respect the past but thrives on an expansive view of the future. That can be a cruel view.\n\nA small but pertinent example: Changi Business Park. A recent Bloomberg article carried by The Business Times said that it was emptying out as global tech and finance layoffs take a toll on it. This news would come as a shock particularly to Indian expatriates, who are more than familiar with what some locals call Chennai Business Park or  Changalore.\n\nSoftness? What softness? The business park’s fortunes are  cyclical: There is no structural softness in it. It was set up for a good reason (to reduce economic concentration in the Central Business District), is meeting international headwinds and will have to recover its position in a globalised Singapore economy.\n\nThe same holds true for globalised India, whose economic future resides in cities such as Bengaluru where talented graduates from elite institutions such as the Indian Institute of Technology congregate because of the economic ecosystem that the cities provide.\n\nBengaluru’s success has spread to Hyderabad and other cities which are now a part of the same trajectory of success that includes Shanghai and Singapore.\n\nIn time to come, Bengaluru might spoil Mr Dharmadhikari’s daughter in a way that he fears Singapore might have done. That does not mean that Bengaluru would have gone soft. It would have reached its optimum level of performance. That is all.\n\nAll this said, there is no way in which Singaporeans can or do imagine that they can go soft on themselves. They can preserve their place in the world only by being realistic about their own chances of survival. No one owes Singapore a living.\n\nNo one owes Bengaluru a living, either.\n\nPerhaps Mr Dharmadhikari’s daughter will return to Singapore in the years to come, strengthened by her residence in Bengaluru.\n\nThe writer is a former Straits Times\n\njournalist.\n\nChangi Business Park and (above, right) Mr Aakash Dharmadhikari.\n\nPhoto: X", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/807235c1ae329da569ae63e6f24d7e72ed21bda74f47235c1d5778bc74d74c67?w=825", "alt_text": "People walking outside Changi Business Park, developed by Ascendas Land (Singapore) and Frasers Centrepoint."}]}

Dickerson, Mr Marc Casper and Mr Manish Bhatia have significantly expanded the presence of their respective firms in Singapore, benefiting our local ecosystem through the creation of good jobs and business opportunities.\n\n“Applied Materials, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Micron are stalwarts in Singapore’s manufacturing sector, and their activities have deepened and strengthened Singapore’s semiconductor and healthcare industries, contributing to our continued attractiveness as an investment destination.”\n\nMr Bhatia, 52, a second-generation American whose parents migrated to the United States from Sindh, now part of Pakistan, said: “I love Singapore for the talent pool it has, there are many qualified students and youth here who can contribute so much to the semiconductor industry making Singapore a forerunner in it. I see the industry continuing to grow here.”\n\nMr Bhatia also shared that he enjoyed his stay in Singapore with his family between 2018 and 2021 when he oversaw the process of NAND flash memory facilities built by Micron.\n\n“Both my family and I loved our time here and we got an apartment to reside in when we visit,” he said.\n\nBefore Micron, Mr Bhatia, who earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served as the executive vice-president of Silicon Operations at Western Digital Corporation.\n\nHe has played a crucial role in shaping Micron’s commitment to building a strong pipeline of semiconductor talent in Singapore.\n\nFor instance, Micron launched a comprehensive partnership with the five polytechnics in Singapore in 2023. This partnership includes providing 20 scholarships annually to polytechnic students with a passion for engineering and an interest in the semiconductor industry.\n\nOn being conferred the award, he said: “I am honoured to receive the Public Service Award on behalf of Micron and our strong team of nearly 9,000 members in Singapore. As semiconductors become an increasingly integral part of our lives, we look forward to continuing our partnerships with the Singapore government and ecosystem partners to drive technology innovation in the years ahead.”\n\nBetween 1998 and 2023, 49 senior business executives have been awarded the Public Service Star, while 49 have been presented the Public Service Medal.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7975bae9e098489df070ce83aea2656ebefea9d7fd08029567ce7df4bddc9213?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Manish Bhatia with his family in Singapore."}]}

One day, I wish to share the health perils of my professional life.

I consider this as a small contribution to society,” the 64-year-old said of his book.\n\nDr Ramam, a director in the president’s office at Nanyang Technological University where he coordinates research administrative matters, lost his wife Vijaya Bhanu to lymph node cancer in 2011. She was only 44.\n\nHis youngest son Sudhakar Akkipeddi, 29, was barely two years old when he was diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis – a rare kidney disease in which scar tissue develops on the glomeruli, the small parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood.\n\nMr Sudhakar’s condition was classified as end-stage kidney failure, a lifelong dialysis.\n\nDr Ramam’s older son Lokesh who works as an engineer, is married and settled in the United States. He helps with his family’s matters and stands as a strong pillar of support for Dr Ramam.\n\n“Before my wife passed away, my daily routine was to get ready for work and send Sudhakar and her to National University Hospital (NUH) for their dialysis and chemotherapy sessions respectively. During lunch time I will get food for them and fetch them back once I end work,” said Dr Ramam, who also cares for his 87-year-old mother.\n\nDr Ramam, a Singapore permanent resident, used to work as a scientist before entering NTU. With a background in engineering, he worked at The Agency for Science, Technology and Research where he contributed to semiconductor research and was deeply involved in the development of LED technology.\n\nIn 2015, he suffered a heart attack but pulled through after undergoing stent-placement surgery.\n\n“Even when I was admitted to hospital, I was thinking only about Sudhakar. I have to live for this boy. It is not the time for me to go yet,” he said.\n\n“I am surviving all alone with a hectic work schedule and managing the domestic chores by myself. It took me some time to move on from Vijaya’s passing.\n\n“I could not cry in front of my sons as they have only me. I have to be strong and take this as an assignment given to me.”\n\nDr Ramam, who is also a certified yoga practitioner, follows a strict routine to keep his health in good shape. He takes long walks daily, plays tennis during his free time and even teaches yoga for free to some of the residents who stay in his condominium at Lakeside.\n\nTime and worry aside, the costs involved in Mr Sudharkar’s treatment has been another concern.\n\n“Hospitalisation costs have soared to $70,000 each year, while dialysis costs another $40,000. Fortunately, my workplace and personal insurance helped to cover some of these medical bills. I am blessed to have earned well from my investments to continue footing the medical bills that have soared over the years,” said Dr Ramam.\n\nWhen his son needed a kidney transplant to survive without dialysis, Dr Ramam tried to donate his kidney – but was rejected as he was a single parent.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Sudhakar underwent a kidney transplant in Chennai. The transplant was successful initially and Dr Ramam and Mr Sudhakar returned to Singapore, but the kidney became unresponsive for a week.\n\n“His underlying condition rejected the kidney. Despite so much effort, I started to wonder if this transplant might lead to another tragedy. Most of my salary went towards Sudhakar’s medical expenses in Singapore and towards funding Lokesh’s education in the United States during that time, ” said Dr Ramam.\n\nMr Sudhakar had to undergo a nephrectomy – a surgery to remove the transplanted kidney, merely a year after the transplant. He had his second emergency kidney transplant at NUH last month.\n\nKidney transplants have the risk of one’s body rejecting the new organ and Mr Sudhakar is not new to this. As a major surgery, it carries risks such as blood clots, infection, stroke, failure of the donated kidney and heart attack.\n\n“Some complications have come up. It’s a complex issue,” said Dr Ramam. “But I will brave through the storm to make sure Sudhakar stays in this world.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/44c8bd1c10907964fe9ca0028b383b8b8817d942c9e47ebb5a2c4d71a5cfcfce?w=825", "alt_text": "Dr Akkipeddi Ramam and son Sudhakar."}]}

Commercial organisations tend to market it as a form of new age “sport” to help reduce stress and improve wellbeing.\n\nBut yoga is not limited to only the commonly known asanas (postures). The asanas form only one of the eight paths that make up complete yoga, also known as Samagra Yoga.\n\nYoga means to join. It is the confluence of body and soul with a focus on increasing soul consciousness.\n\nGenerally, yoga asanas have been of interest to make the body beautiful and shapely. But by doing this, priority is given to the body itself and thus increasing body consciousness, which is completely opposite to the essence of yoga.\n\nComplete yoga can be understood through the eight paths of Ashtang Yoga: Yam – renunciation of bad deeds; Niyam – being part of good deeds; Aasana – positions to have control over the body; Pranayam – control over one’s breath; Pratyahar – introspection of values; Dharana – focus in one place (often a guru); Dhyan – experiencing a thoughtless state; and Samadhi – having no bodily feelings or body consciousness.\n\nOne considers oneself to be a soul.\n\n“As soon as you start practising Samagra Yoga, then the yoga inside you starts to happen. You start getting the benefits of all these steps automatically,” says spiritual master His Holiness Shree Shivkrupanand Swami, founder of Himalayan Samarpan Meditation.\n\nHe  has been spreading Himalayan Samarpan Meditation for the past 28 years to bring self-realisation to the masses and elevate soul consciousness.\n\nHe says that through Himalayan Samarpan Meditation, an inculcation of values happens by connecting with one’s soul and one automatically reaches the state of samadhi – the last step of complete yoga.\n\nSwamiji adds that Himalayan Samarpan Meditation is a method of yoga that has the power to connect one human being with another; amplifying the concept “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” – the whole world is a family.\n\nHimalayan Samarpan Meditation is currently practised in 29 countries, including Singapore.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe official Fifa World Cup Instagram handle has sent Indian fans into a frenzy, with a post commemorating both cricket legend M.S. Dhoni and iconic Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nAs the forward prepared to start his Euro 2024 campaign with Portugal on Wednesday, when his side beat the Czech Republic 2-1, the Fifa World Cup account made a unique comparison.\n\nBoth players have made the No. 7 jersey their trademark in their respective sport, and Fifa, football’s world governing body, used the opportunity to catch the hearts of Indian fans on the Internet.\n\nPosting a photo of Ronaldo, the official Fifa World Cup account captioned it: “Thala for a reason”, reported The Times of India.\n\nThe phrase has gone viral among Indian cricket fans. It is used whenever a reference to the number 7 is made, as a tribute to the former India captain Dhoni.\n\nThala is a colloquial Tamil word, which means leader or chief. Dhoni is called Thala because he was the long-standing captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK), a team based in Tamil Nadu’s capital Chennai, since the first season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008.\n\nCSK’s performance under the leadership of Dhoni has been unmatched. The team won the IPL title five times and also the Champions League title.\n\nNicknamed Thala, Dhoni is the beating heart of CSK. Dhoni dons the No. 7 jersey  for CSK. He also sported No. 7 in his trophy-laden international career between 2004  and 2019.\n\nFifa’s post was limited to Indian viewers, and a clever tactic to garner the love of both football and cricket fans in India, reported the Hindustan Times\n\nDhoni played in this year’s edition of the IPL, where he scored 161 runs in 14 matches.\n\nHis impending retirement talk over the last two IPL seasons has created a wave of tribute towards the 42-year-old, and “Thala for a reason” is one of the trends that has become popular.\n\nDhoni and his love for the number 7 is well documented by his fan army. Over the years, Dhoni loyalists have flooded social media with posts about the former CSK skipper.\n\nEarlier, Google also joined the “Thala for a reason” trend by honouring Dhoni in a heart-warming post. Multiple brands shared their takes on the “Thala for a reason” trend during the IPL season.\n\nAfter calling time on his illustrious international career in 2020, Dhoni only features in the cash-rich IPL.\n\nThere was speculation about him retiring after the 2024 edition of the IPL. On the eve of this year’s IPL opener between CSK and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Dhoni stepped down as the leader of the Super Kings franchise.\n\nDhoni handed the captaincy to Indian opener Ruturaj Gaikwad. With seven wins from 14 matches, CSK failed to enter the playoff stage. The team finished fifth in the 10-team tournament with 14 points.\n\nRonaldo, who wears No. 7 for Portugal, will be aiming to fire Portugal towards a second Euro title, after their maiden trophy in 2016.\n\nWith the likes of Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes, Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva and AC Milan’s Rafael Leao for company, Portugal are one of the favourites in Euro 2024.\n\nIndian batsman-wicketkeeper M.S.

It also indicates longevity and resilience, like seen when priceless vintages are unearthed during excavations and from shipwrecks.\n\nThis enduring symbolism was prominent when Mr Ismail Gafoor, CEO of leading real estate  agency PropNex, and his siblings celebrated the 100th birthday of their father Abdul Gafoore Mohamed Kassim on Father’s Day (June16).\n\nFifty specially-crafted tea sets were presented to the families who attended the event at the Sky Ballroom in Parkroyal on Beach Road.\n\n“These tea sets are not just tokens of the celebration,” said Mr Ismail. “These symbolise the enduring values of hard work, love and strength that the patriarch has shown and are reminders of his principles that have guided our family through generations — a legacy that I hope will inspire future generations as well.”\n\nThe poignant ceremony, blending Father’s Day and a remarkable milestone, was attended by about 80 guests, who included family members, close relatives and longtime friends.\n\nIn speeches by family members and guests, the head of the Gafoor family was described as a loving father and friend.\n\nMr Ismail spoke emotionally about the lessons he learnt from his father and the values the old man instilled in him from a young age.\n\n“I owe everything I am today to my father,” Mr Ismail said. “From the early days when I helped him with his newspaper delivery to the unwavering principles of hard work and compassion that he displayed, he shaped not just my life but the lives of our entire family.”\n\nBorn into a poor family in India, Mr Gafoore started working as a labourer at the age of seven. He  arrived in Singapore in 1947, seeking opportunities to build a better life.\n\nIn the decades thereafter, through diligent work in grocery stores and as a newspaper delivery man, he provided for his family, both in Singapore and back in his hometown of Kodavasal in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHis commitment to his family’s well-being and his steadfast values of discipline and determination were evident throughout the journey.\n\n“This event is more than a celebration of age,” Mr Ismail said. “It’s a testament to the values my father has lived by – values that have shaped our family’s success and unity.”\n\nHe said that his father leads a simple life, adding that Mr Gafoore still wears the pants sewn by his wife Maharunisabi Kadir Maideen, 78, about 35 years ago.\n\nHe also drinks coffee from a 40-year-old cup – a gift from The Straits Times.\n\nMr Ismail’s siblings, three brothers and a sister, paid a video tribute to Mr Gafoore.\n\nYoungest son Nizam Gafoor said his father donated all his wealth to social causes in his hometown.\n\nMr Gafoore turned his house in Kodavasal into a religious school for women. More than 300 students are studying there. He has also channelled other savings to build a mosque,  a community hall and a clinic.\n\nAnother sibling, Mr Burhan Gafoor, who is Singapore’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, is based in New York and could not attend the celebration.\n\nLawyer Subra M. Suppiah from Subra TT Law LLC attended the celebration with his wife. He sang a Tamil song on stage.\n\nMr Subra, who has known the Gafoor family for the past 20 years, said the love showered on him by Mr Gafoore is unparalleled.\n\nThe celebration came as a surprise to Mr Gafoore. He learnt of it only when he was wheeled into the ballroom by his sons.\n\nMr Gafoore was visibly surprised and greeted everyone with a beaming smile. As he moved down the red carpet, the guests threw rose petals to welcome him.\n\n“My heart is full of gratitude as I reflect on the incredible journey of my life, surrounded by the love and warmth of my beloved family,” said Mr Gafoore. “I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my family, extended family members and friends. Each of you have made my life vibrant and meaningful, filling it with joy and cherished memories.”\n\nPropNex’s CEO Mr Ismail Gafoor made a special tea set for all the family who attended the event.\n\nSPH Media Limited", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/59e9caa6d95b6b4ddb20ed3a335812073f9b41a06ad4eeb2557c3c813226743d?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Abdul Gafoore Mohamed Kassim being showered with rose petals on his 100th birthday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5df6b49b84a517fc8999b6800d7bd955a1394206d4fac75c4a9df8a56edd6a30?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Abdul Gafoore Mohamed Kassim being showered with rose petals on his 100th birthday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/59e9caa6d95b6b4ddb20ed3a335812073f9b41a06ad4eeb2557c3c813226743d?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Abdul Gafoore Mohamed Kassim being showered with rose petals on his 100th birthday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5df6b49b84a517fc8999b6800d7bd955a1394206d4fac75c4a9df8a56edd6a30?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Abdul Gafoore Mohamed Kassim being showered with rose petals on his 100th birthday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/59e9caa6d95b6b4ddb20ed3a335812073f9b41a06ad4eeb2557c3c813226743d?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Abdul Gafoore Mohamed Kassim being showered with rose petals on his 100th birthday."}]}

Rajinikanth, the superstar of Tamil cinema, is paid between Rs150 crore and Rs210 crore for a film.\n\nThalapathy Vijay is third, reportedly charging between Rs130 crore and Rs200 crore for a project.\n\nThe others on the list are: Prabhas (Rs100 crore to Rs200 crore), Aamir Rs100 crore to Rs175 crore), Salman (Rs100 crore to Rs150crore), Kamal Haasan (Rs100 crore to Rs150 crore), Arjun (Rs100 crore to Rs125 crore), Akshay Kumar (Rs60 crore to Rs 145 crore) and Ajith Kumar (Rs105 crore).\n\nForbes also says that Shah Rukh is clearly the king with an estimated net worth of Rs6,300 crore ($972 million).\n\nThe 58-year-old, fondly known as SRK, most recently starred in Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki, which received mixed reviews from the audience and critics.\n\nBut overall he is an iconic figure in Bollywood, renowned for his stellar performances in more than 80 films.\n\nShah Rukh’s journey to stardom began with humble origins, starting with stage productions in Delhi before making his television debut in the 1988 series Fauji.\n\nHis silver screen debut came in 1992 with Deewana, marking the onset of a prolific career adorned with critical accolades and commercial triumphs.\n\nKnown as King Khan, Shah Rukh has had his share of flops, but his recent successes, Jawan and Pathaan, both grossing over Rs 2,000 crore worldwide, reassert his dominance.\n\nBeyond acting, his entrepreneurial spirit shines through his ventures as a co-owner of cricket franchises Kolkata Knight Riders and the Trinbago Knight Riders.\n\nHe has also made significant investments in diverse business ventures, leveraging his brand value and financial acumen to establish a formidable presence in the corporate landscape.\n\nCentral to Shah Rukh’s business empire is his production company Red Chillies Entertainment, which has churned out a myriad of successful movies and TV shows.

Nuts do not cause weight gain. Furthermore, they do not adversely affect weight loss, rather they appear to assist it,” said Prof Coates.\n\nDr Sharayah Carter, co-author of the study, said: “For those who enjoy eating nuts, knowing that they can help meet weight loss goals, while also improving overall health, is a huge plus.\n\n“It’s also great for health professionals who can be confident in recommending nuts, in the context of a healthy diet, without concerns of an adverse effect on weight.”\n\nIndo-Asian News Service", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a3869254b739cff8316969a62e0db9c1e5b08afb5b83265e708f19c4e9d69aef?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

In fact, we, kids, kept our lips sealed about the scolding, pinching and caning that transpired.\n\nComplaining to parents would mean a second round of pain since, in those days, mum and dad believed teachers were always right. So our policy was: What happens in school stays in school.\n\nOn the contrary, today’s students do not hesitate to blab. They know that their parents will confront the teacher, complain to the Ministry of Education, go on social media or consult a lawyer. Many parents do all of the above.\n\nSo, now it is the teachers who are being criticised, publicly shamed and even threatened.\n\nParents have even involved the law. In 2019, Shin Min Daily News reported that the mother of a Primary 6 student filed a police report about her child being caned by the headmistress.\n\nA check reveals that the Education Act allows caning of male students but not girls. Also, no other corporal punishment besides caning is allowed.\n\nThank heavens my Primary 3 form teacher in the 1960s has long retired.\n\nFor ‘‘transgressions’’ such as failing to complete your homework or talking or misbehaving during a lesson, you would be summoned to her desk in front of the classroom. She would then grab about a centimetre of flesh at the side of your waist with her fire-engine red nail-polished fingers and twist with gusto.\n\nFor the rest of the class, it was truly a sight to behold the victim squirming every which way – like a fish on a hook. We called her Miss Pincher – only behind her back of course.\n\nOther forms of punishment from her and our other teachers included making the offender stand on a chair or outside the classroom.\n\nThere have also been cases of “flying dusters”, when an infuriated teacher would throw the blackboard duster at overly talkative students. Being kampung kids, we knew how to duck, but we got the message.\n\nDespite what could be considered cruel and unusual punishment these days, most of us grew up and become responsible citizens.\n\nMuch thanks to our teachers, especially Miss Pincher, who not only administered her peculiar brand of punishment but did not discriminate. Both male and female students were pinched equally.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7a958a5a727794763f19fe878a9f90937c2dba30f2ad6800d7d450737d85c8e7?w=825", "alt_text": "Caning a student was common in the 1960s."}]}

It is now seeing an unparalleled spike in American fans, reported The Week.\n\nAmerica’s obsession with cricket was cemented by the US team’s June 6 win over Test-playing Pakistan at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup.\n\n“The win was the biggest in US cricket history and is already being regarded as one of the biggest upsets in the sport,” said CNN.\n\nBut even before that stunning victory, which ensured their entry into the Super Eight stage of the tournament, cricket was gaining fans in the US.\n\nAccording to CBS News, there are at least 400 nationwide cricket leagues. This equates to about 200,000 players, and this figure is expected to continue rising in the coming years.\n\nAlso notable are the number of fans attending cricket matches.\n\nThe June 9 Pakistan-India match and the June 12 US-India match, which both took place in Nassau County, New York, drew more than 34,000 spectators, according to the International Cricket Council.\n\nMore than 400 million people globally watched the Pakistan-India game, compared to the 125 million that watched this year’s Super Bowl.\n\nThe names of American cricket stars are “obscure in the eyes of most Americans,” and yet the “potential for cricket’s growth in America has never looked stronger,” said The Atlantic.\n\nThis is partially because of a demographic shift over the past century. While baseball was cemented as America’s national pastime by the early 20th century, in the 1960s “increased immigration from the West Indies reinvigorated cricket, in the New York region especially, and in the decades that followed, immigration from South Asia also dramatically increased,” The Atlantic said.\n\nToday, there are “more than five million Americans of South Asian descent, the majority being Indian American,” said The Atlantic, though many of them “have almost nowhere local to play or watch the game.” This has created pent-up demand and a new market for cricket players.\n\nBeyond the average fan of the game, there are also a “coterie of big-money backers including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and Access Healthcare chairman Anurag Jain” who are looking to increase cricket’s profile, said Vanity Fair.\n\nAll three have invested in Major League Cricket, the US men’s pro league that launched with six teams last year.\n\nThe game will also be featured at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. “It’s truly a watershed moment for cricket in this country,” cricket writer Smit Patel told CBS.\n\n“There’s a growing embracing of what is a global sport,” University of Colorado professor emeritus Jay Coakley told the Christian Science Monitor. “But I don’t see cricket just entering the US like a waterfall. I see it more like a stream.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a4894ef1ec206f525a802a2cdc4de6682ec70fb30ff1eb04143ce33a3afd2bce?w=825", "alt_text": "Local fans at the T20 World Cup match between the US and India in New York."}]}

Komala’s charges $6.60, while MTR in Serangoon Road, which serves one of the best masala thosais in town, charges $7.\n\nIt can be a rather expensive affair.\n\nSo I embarked on a quest to the heartlands, hoping to find coffee shop stalls that serve decent yet affordable thosai.\n\nWhat makes a decent thosai, you ask? A good thosai – made from fermented batter of rice and urad dal – should be spongy and crisp on the outside and white and soft inside. Of course, the potato masala and accompanying chutney and sambar condiments matter too.\n\nFor the purpose of my search, value and the coffee shop’s ambience are taken into account as well.\n\nLocated in a well-renovated Kopitiam Corner at Vista Point shopping mall is a stall (Al Fazilah) that serves one of the cheapest masala thosais in town.\n\nI learnt that the low pricing was a result of a “Budget Meal” scheme implemented by the Housing Development Board (HDB) in heartlands across Singapore. The initiative, which started in May 2023, provides affordable meal options ($3.50 or less for food, $1.20 or less for drinks) to low-income families and the elderly.\n\nIn line with the scheme, HDB launched a BudgetMealGoWhere website – in collaboration with GovTech – for customers to locate the stalls with ease. Patrons can also add budget meal locations to the list online, pending a few verifications steps.\n\nA plethora of thosai options can be found on the BudgetMealGoWhere website among 291 coffee shop stalls. Out of these, 125 are halal-certified.\n\nAway from the heartlands, there are actually a few stalls at Tekka Centre in Little India that sell masala thosai for a mere $2.50 – Naga Indian Food Stall, Sri Aachi Aapakadai and Sri Tiffin Stall – to name a few.\n\nAs these outlets aren’t considered “HDB coffee shops”, they are not listed on the BudgetMealGoWhere website.\n\nIf you come across any affordable masala thosai options around Singapore, do add the entry to the list – so we can all savour thosai while saving money.\n\nAl Fazilah (548 Woodlands Drive 44)\n\nThosai: 3.5 (out of 5)\n\nChutney/Sambar: 3.5\n\nAmbience: 4.5 (clean and the food court is air-conditioned)\n\nValue: 5\n\nQuite possibly one of the cheapest masala thosais in town, the meal was well worth the price, both in terms of portion and taste.\n\nFor just $2.50, you get a masala thosai with three condiments – spicy sambal, coconut chutney and chicken curry.\n\nAK Amir Indian Muslim Food (610 Tampines North Drive 1)\n\nThosai: 3\n\nChutney/Sambar: 4.5\n\nAmbience: 3.5\n\nValue: 4.5\n\nThosai lovers can attest to how important a good chutney is. Made in a variety of forms, such as a tomato relish or yogurt, with cucumber, coconut, onion or mint, the dipping sauce can turn an average thosai into a good one.\n\nAK Amir Indian Muslim Food in Tampines is an example of this dynamic.

I am not as simple as you all say. I don’t know what else I have to do. According to me, being handsome or smart has nothing to do with physical appearance.”\n\nWhen asked about the trend of actors having six-packs, he said: “How many of us here have a six-pack? Let me get the number. Aren’t you all heroes at your own homes? Aren’t you heroes to your wife and kids?\n\n“I am not against it. Suppose, if there is a project where I have to do it, then I will. The filmmakers should give me time for it. But the story should convince you to do that. I won’t get a six-pack for the sake of it.”\n\nSethupathi plays a cold-blooded barber in Maharaja, reported The Times of India. Directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, the film also stars Anurag Kashyap and Abhirami.\n\nThe film’s trailer promises an action-packed ride. It is a whirlwind of action sequences, glimpses of a dark and complex storyline and hints at a ruthless side to Sethupathi’s character.\n\nThe background music by B. Ajaneesh Loknath adds to the film’s intensity.\n\nIt marks a departure from Sethupathi’s usual roles, showcasing him in a gritty and intense avatar.\n\nThe actor recently revealed he would not be acting as an antagonist because of bad experiences.\n\n“Many producers are offering me villain roles, and they want me to hear the script before saying ‘no’,” he said. “I don’t have time to listen to all of them. That’s why I stopped listening to such pitches.”\n\nSethupathi also said he is not averse to doing an action film.\n\n“Everything is fine by me. As an actor, I have to justify the story if I like it. I can’t say this is right and this is wrong,” he said.\n\n“I don’t have anything against commercial films. If I get a good film and a director who has it in him to execute it, I will do it.”\n\nHowever, Sethupathi made it clear that he will not act in a film that has a much younger female lead. His sentiment goes against the grain of Indian films where casting male actors in their 60s along with females who are much younger is rather common.\n\n“I have spoken out about this before,” Sethupathi said, referring to his 2021 film Uppena in which he worked opposite 20-year-old actress Krithi Shetty.\n\n“I acted with Krithi Shetty in Uppena in 2021, and later, a director told me to approach her for another film as a heroine. I said no because I had asked her to consider me as a dad during the climax sequence of Uppena.\n\n“What if she had told me that she doesn’t want to act with me because ‘this man has asked me to consider him as dad’? She can say no also.”\n\nWithin a month of its release, Maharaja will appear on Netflix, enabling a wider audience to appreciate Sethupathi’s newest cinematic offering.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e888dd4da659dbce2c466ddef01c0a2ffd967e23335d48c9328096cae22eccb0?w=825", "alt_text": "Vijay Sethupathi in Maharaja."}]}

Police had to put up barricades around the police station in Bengaluru to hold back desperate fans who were calling for his release, visuals on local media showed.\n\nAccording to OneIndia, Mr Swamy was an ardent fan of the actor. A resident of Chitradurga, he was reportedly murdered at the instruction of Darshan after he sent lewd messages to actress Pavithra Gowda, who is believed to be in a relationship with Darshan.\n\nThirteen people, including Darshan, have been arrested over the incident.\n\nNDTV reported that Mr Swamy, who worked at a pharmacy and got married last year, forwarded Pavithra photos of his private parts and claimed that he was “better in bed’’ than Darshan.\n\nFed up with the harassment, the actress confided the matter to her house help Pawan, who notified Darshan.\n\nThe actor then instructed Raghavendra, the president of his fan club Akhila Karnataka Darshan Thoogudeepa Sena, to kidnap Mr Swamy. Darshan allegedly paid Rs30 lakh ($480,000) to a gang to murder Mr Swamy and dispose of the body.\n\nAccording to a TV9 Kannada report, a woman associated with the Chitradurga Darshan Fans’ Association contacted Mr Swamy and lured him out of his house.\n\nMr Swamy was confined in a warehouse in Kamakshipalya, a Bengaluru neighbourhood, where he was beaten severely. He eventually succumbed to his injuries.\n\n“Raghavendra and a few others abducted Swamy from Chitradurga on Saturday morning. Swamy, who was on his way to the pharmacy, was bundled into a car and taken to the warehouse,” a police officer told the Times Of India.\n\n“There, Swamy was locked up and severely beaten by Raghavendra and four others. In the evening, Darshan  joined in the beating along with a few others. Later, Pavithra too was present at the warehouse, when one more round of thrashing was carried out. Swamy died on the spot.”\n\nAccording to reports, the group inflicted severe injuries on Mr Swamy, slashing his nose, mouth and jaw.\n\nMr Swamy’s body also showed burn marks, suggesting the use of a hot iron rod. Police sources told NDTV that more than 10 people, including Darshan, assaulted Mr Swamy, repeatedly throwing him against a wall.\n\nHis body was discovered by local people in a drain in Kamakshipalya as it was being chewed by stray dogs.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Bengaluru trial court ordered Darshan, Pavithra and 11 others, to be remanded in police custody for six days.\n\nIn a video shared by Public TV on YouTube, Nr Swamy’s wife Sahana is seen breaking down in tears.\n\nShe said she was three months pregnant and was looking forward to celebrating her first wedding anniversary with Mr Swamy on June 28. “Why did they kill my husband? Don’t they have families?” she asked.\n\nMr Swamy’s parents are seeking a complete ban on Darshan. They have requested the Karnataka government to stop the releases of his films in the state.\n\nCalling him a “villain’’, the elderly couple said his fans deserved to know that their idol is a criminal.\n\n“He was my only son. He got married last year. I spoke to him just on Saturday. I want justice,” his father Srinivasaiah said.\n\nAlleged victim Renuka Swamy\n\nPhotos: Instagram\n\n“In the evening, Darshan joined in the beating along with a few others.

It officially opened in 1924, two years after the purchase of the land where it currently stands at Jalan Bukit Merah.\n\nThe land was purchased by members of the Sikh Contingent of the Straits Settlements Police Force and used for religious and community gatherings. It was the first gurdwara (Sikh temple) in Singapore whose architecture included a traditional Sikh dome.\n\nDuring World War II, SRST housed the widows and families of Sikh soldiers killed in action.\n\nAfter the war, while some of these families returned to India, the temple continued to provide accommodation to Sikhs in transit from India to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and to the newly migrated local Sikhs – a role it played until the 1990s.\n\nThis year also marks the 168th anniversary of the saint-soldier Bhai Maharaj Singh, who died during internment by the British at Outram Prison in 1856, and to whom the adjacent memorial at SRST is dedicated.\n\nWhile the SRST started as a gurdwara for the Sikh Contingent of the Straits Settlements Police Force who were among the first Sikhs brought in by the British in the late 19th century to help with law and order, it was merged with Central Sikh Temple in 1981 to form the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board.\n\nToday, SRST continues to provide religious activities to the devotees and runs a significant community kitchen that operates seven days a week and was particularly active during the Covid-19 lockdowns, serving thousands of meals a day to people of all races.\n\nIt is arguably the most patronised gurdwara in Singapore and maybe even the region, not least because of the Bhai Maharaj Sahib Memorial located within its premises which is visited by Sikhs and non-Sikhs.\n\nOver the years, the temple has been instrumental in fostering understanding of the Sikh community and its traditions, promoting interfaith harmony and serving as a conduit between the Sikh community and the wider Singapore community, thereby making an indelible contribution to inter-religious harmony and nation-building.\n\nSRST’s 100th anniversary celebrations not only commemorate its history and contributions, but also highlights its continued commitment to contribute to Singapore’s multicultural fabric.\n\nBhai Maharaj Singh Ji - A Saint Soldier", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f5d195ad5b13604ee892f1228217b6dc98474cda42033e6b8f9aed52ff7fad49?w=825", "alt_text": "The Bhai Maharaj Memorial, which was opened in 2010."}]}

Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nThere are dishes at TANI Bistro & Bar that would not be out of place at a top-rated tandoori restaurant in Little India.\n\nYes, you can roll up and order a beer as well, but referring to the venue – at Zhongshan Mall in Balestier Road – as a “bar’ doesn’t quite do it justice, given how good the food was.\n\nIt came as no surprise when I learnt later that the owner, Mr Chandradev Sharma, is an established restaurateur.\n\nThe small neighbourhood mall has seen several changes over the years. It started out in the early 2000s as a modest plaza with a food court and a 7-11 that served mostly the guests staying at the mid-range hotel attached to it.\n\nToday, it houses a string of restaurants, a handful of salons and a FairPrice outlet. It is also perpetually busy with diners and shoppers from all over town. Not a bad place to run a cosy bar overlooking the mall’s courtyard.\n\n“The mall is bigger and better now, with more shops and restaurants, so it’s getting more popular,” said Mr Chandradev, 47, who bought over TANI Bistro & Bar in 2022 after the commercial effects of the pandemic had eased.\n\n“We are crowded almost every evening, and not just on weekends. We get a mixed crowd, not just Indians – all other races come here too,” he added.\n\nAt 6pm on a Saturday evening, the place, which can hold about 70 patrons both indoors and out, isn’t packed to the tilt, but there are a handful of regulars who greet and chat with Mr Chandradev as they walk in. Some of them didn’t even need to place an order – as if the waiters already knew what a nod indicating “I’ll have the usual” meant.\n\nMr Chandradev, who hails from Jharkhand, is also the co-owner of Tandoori Culture in Hillview Rise, which serves authentic and well-reviewed North Indian cuisine.\n\nThough he elected not to change the name when he bought over TANI (which means “water” in Tamil, and colloquially refers to liquor), the establishment did see a change in the kitchen, in the form of a new head chef. As a result, the food quality at the bistro doesn’t stray too far from that of Tandoori Culture.\n\nThe Seafood Platter ($30), for instance, came with six pieces of fish so fresh you could hardly pick it up with a fork. The Adraki Lamb Chops ($28) was also well-roasted with the right amount of fat trimmings along the bone.\n\nAs far as “bar bites” go, on the menu are bhaji pav ($10) and vada pav ($6), along with various chaats and puris to go along with your pints of beer.\n\nTo perhaps complete the experience, especially for the Indians who frequent the bar, it would have been ideal to screen Indian Premier League cricket matches on the two giant TVs inside and outside the bar.\n\n“Right now, we can’t show the cricket matches (because of licensing issues),” explained Mr Chandradev. “But maybe down the road, we’ll see.”\n\nGood food, ice cold beer and live cricket. That would take the transformed Zhongshan Mall up yet another level.\n\nAdraki Lamb Chops.\n\nSeafood Platter.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bf73d7bee2270ab0ea2423c6ec32235504fbe24a9183418688af2942e1799ec3?w=825", "alt_text": "TANI Bistro & Bar at Zhongshan Mall in Balestier."}]}

Apps, reels and stories have made it easier to connect with more people.\n\nOnline dating has become the norm of new-age romance, and terms and phrases such as fizzling and masterdating have become catchy.\n\nNow, pebbling, a new trend inspired by penguins, is gaining popularity and has made a lot of social media users happy.\n\nIt means giving small presents or making kind gestures to your partner to make his or her day brighter.\n\nIt draws inspiration from Gentoo penguins, usually found on the Falkland Islands. According to the New York Post, when a penguin has a crush, it gives pebbles to the other penguin which are used to build nests. This signals that it is keen on becoming a mating partner.\n\nIn the case of humans, pebbling can take place in the form of memes, Instagram reels, social media posts or simple messages to show affection.\n\n“I think it’s the cutest thing ever because memes are a love language these days. Pebbling started with the advent of meme-sending as a form of creating a connection with people,” relationship expert Gigi Engle told Metro UK.\n\n“You simply see something that reminds you of someone you love, and you send it to them.”\n\nGen Z looks at memes as a form of interaction, often in lieu of text messaging.\n\nMs Engle said: “It’s a way of sending a message saying, ‘I saw this and thought of you’.\n\n“Pebbling can be a really good way of building banter and a connection with a partner. It doesn’t have to be physical stuff – it’s meme culture.”\n\nHowever, if the pebbles – which include posts, videos and memes – quickly cease between two people, there could be a problem.\n\n“Pebbling does have the potential to set an expectation of communication you’re going to have throughout your relationship, so that’s something to keep in mind,” said Ms Engle.\n\n“If you stop pebbling, the other person may wonder what they did wrong.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/008511398d427d672b0d193a344112a7c57e905eb824bc2fea5b2d1be0f5deb5?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Another World Cup campaign has passed and Singapore’s football team just can’t seem to make the leap to the next stage.\n\nMind you, the next stage being the third round of qualifying, and not the World Cup proper. That, according to the powers that be who govern Singapore sport, is a realistic goal only by 2034. Though I’m sure they might be tempted to “push the goal back” another 16 or 20 years after watching Singapore get trounced 7-0 by South Korea last week.\n\nLocal football fans like myself set our targets a little lower. And while the recent qualifying campaign went up in flames, there’s a silver lining in all the ensuing smoke – at least we made sure our regional rivals Thailand didn’t advance either.\n\nDespite losing 3-1 to the Thais in Bangkok on Tuesday, Singapore’s solitary goal through Ikhsan Fandi meant Thailand could not leapfrog China in Group C and join group winners South Korea in the next round.\n\nWith South Korea claiming a 1-0 win over China in Seoul ahead of the Thailand-Singapore game, the Thais needed to beat Singapore by three goals.\n\nChina, who were level on points and goal difference with Thailand, advanced owing to a better head-to-head record after beating the latter 2-1 in November.\n\nThis, of course, has made us millions of new friends in China. In fact, so delighted were Chinese football fans here that they flocked to goalkeeper Hassan Sunny’s Muslim food stall in Tampines the day after the game.\n\nAgainst Thailand, the 40-year-old custodian saw a total of 35 shots fired at him, 13 of which were on target. The keeper also made a crucial save in the dying minutes when the Thais were throwing everything they had at him.\n\nHis stall, which sells nasi padang, saw a long queue of Chinese customers on Wednesday morning, with many taking selfies with the stall’s signboard in the background, while some also spammed online reviews with five stars.\n\nChinese fans also flooded social media platform Weibo to thank Hassan. “I suggest that this year’s Chinese Footballer of the Year award be given to Singapore goalkeeper Sunny,” a post with more than 1.7 million likes said.\n\nScorer Ikhsan received some love too.\n\nChinese fans swarmed the striker’s Instagram, commenting that he was the “saviour of Chinese football” and calling for him to join the Chinese Super League (CSL).\n\nApparently, one hashtag on Weibo that has been viewed more than 15 million times showed that searches for trips to Singapore from the mainland had increased by five times by Tuesday night.\n\nFootball has served this country well, indeed.\n\nMeanwhile, India, like Thailand, painfully missed out on the third round as well, after losing 2-1 to Qatar in Doha in controversial fashion.\n\nThe Indians needed a victory and for Kuwait not to win their match against Afghanistan. They led for 73 minutes before the referee judged Qatar’s equaliser as fair even after the ball appeared to have gone out of play.\n\nLearning from the sidelines that Kuwait were leading 1-0 in their match, India poured forward, leaving gaps at the back for Qatar to score the winner.\n\nIf Singapore were playing Kuwait instead of Afghanistan, things might have turned out differently.

He was among five Indian-origin players who played big roles in the match. Three of them have cricketing roots in India and migrated to the US to play regular international cricket.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who holds a US H1B visa (for workers in specialty occupations), developed his interest in cricket thanks to his father Naresh in Mumbai. He represented India Under-19s in the 2010 World Cup and made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in 2013, but decided to study computer science at Cornell University in New York in 2015 after he failed to secure a permanent berth in the Mumbai side.\n\nAccording to his father, when Netravalkar left Mumbai, he had not even carried his bowling shoes. “He saw a few people playing cricket near where he stayed,” said Naresh. “He played the game as a pastime. Look at his destiny – the US got a chance to play in this World Cup as the hosts, and Saurabh got a chance to represent them.”\n\nAfter Pakistan lost to the US, the popular take was the Test-playing nation lost to India B.\n\nLeading from the front was captain Monank Patel, 31, who won the Player of the Match award for his half-century.\n\nHe grew up in Anand, near Ahmedabad, and failed to make the India Under-19 grade. Disenchanted, he moved to the US in 2014 and became a restaurateur. But tossing noodles in woks at Teriyaki Madness, his restaurant in New Jersey, was not something he relished. He sold the restaurant and focused on cricket again. Soon after, former US coach J. Arunkumar recognised his talents and roped him into the team.\n\nSpinner Nosthush Kenjige, 33, who took three wickets against Pakistan, was born in Alabama, where his father Pradeep did his master’s in agriculture. When he was just two months old, the family returned to the quaint coffee-town of Chikkamagaluru in Karnataka. Nosthush developed an interest in cricket and played at the league level in Bengaluru, before beginning his life anew in Virginia as a biological technician.\n\nNosthush began playing in local leagues in the US. He then did community service for 800 hours a year to become eligible to represent the US.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Harmeet Singh, 31, whose bowling action is likened to Indian legend Bishan Singh Bedi, left India as a shattered man after setbacks and rejection, including an alleged match-fixing scandal that he was eventually cleared of.\n\nThe Mumbai-born Harmeet moved to the US in 2020, when he received an offer from USA Cricket, who back then were recruiting overseas players to play for them soon after getting one-day international status.\n\nBatsman Milind Kumar, who took a blinder in the Super Over when the US beat Pakistan, previously represented Delhi and Sikkim in India before quitting his oil-and-gas job and flying to Houston, were he played league cricket.\n\nA veteran of 46 first-class games with IPL experience, the 33-year-old Delhi-born Milind was a substitute against Pakistan, but left his imprint on the game with an acrobatic catch to consume Iftikhar Ahmed in the Super Over.\n\nNitish Kumar, whose last-ball four tied the game against Pakistan, was born in Ontario, Canada, but moved to the US during the pandemic.\n\n“Toronto had one of the longest lockdowns in the world. There was nothing going on in terms of cricket,” he told ESPNcricinfo. “To be fair, I’ve always dreamt about playing cricket. And I’m someone that’s 100 per cent in; I’m not going to do 50-50.”\n\nSo he shifted to the US in 2020. In four years, he did enough with the bat for the US team to earn the nickname “Tendulkar”.\n\nAnd then there are all-rounders Jasdeep Singh and Nisarg Patel, both of whom began their cricketing journey in India before moving to the US.\n\nNisarg, 36, has not yet played a match at the T20 World Cup but is “very excited” that the US are playing so well.\n\n“There’s nothing bigger for players than to play in the World Cup,” he told the Times of India. “We have played against Ireland many times and also against Canada.

In the text, the 39-year-old said he was unlikely to make it down after contracting high-altitude cerebral oedema, a severe type of high-altitude illness that could prove fatal.\n\nDespite a harrowing search-and-rescue mission that lasted a week, Mr Shrinivas was never found and Ms Sushma was forced to confront the inevitable – that she would not see her loving husband of nine years ever again.\n\nTo compound her sorrow, their pet dog Latte fell ill on the day he went missing, and died three weeks later from stage three cancer at the age of 12.\n\nWhile Ms Sushma saw it as a “profoundly beautiful” testament to “how intertwined their lives were”, the double loss left an unfillable void in her home and heart.\n\n“The grief took its toll on my vocal cords, causing a voice condition known as muscle tension dysphonia, and I had to undergo voice therapy,” she told tabla!\n\nAs the months went by and she recovered her voice, Ms Sushma turned to music as an outlet for her pent-up grief, and produced an album – titled The Mountain Has The Last Say – a moving tribute to her late husband.\n\nThe idea for the album struck her as she was preparing for various shows in India last year.\n\n“Given my state of mind, I felt uncomfortable, like I was lying to myself. How could I sing in this grief?,” she said. “That was when I realised that my only real way back into music was Shri himself.”\n\nIn October, she penned songs based on poems she had written after learning of her husband’s death.\n\n“I wanted the album to revolve around Shri’s own words – ‘the mountain has the last say’. It was something he always believed in, and it stemmed from the reverence he had for the majestic mountains.”\n\nShe turned to her best friend and fellow musician Aditya Prakash, whom she collaborated with on her earlier albums (HOME and her debut Sa), to produce the album. The duo recorded it at studios in Singapore and India over the course of three months until January this year.\n\n“Aditya saw me through my darkest moments during my mourning stages and is the only person who could have produced the album for me,” she said.\n\n“The moment I started work on it, I felt more at peace. By allowing myself to express my grief, it felt like I could move forward and experience other forms of music.\n\n“When it was finished, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to release it to the public because it felt so personal – it was a diary into my mind, a piece of my heart.”\n\nIt was in March this year, when Ms Sushma listened to rock singer Nick Cave’s Ghosteen album written in the aftermath of his son’s death and Richard Skelton’s music following the death of his wife, that she found the inspiration to release her songs.\n\n“Without even knowing their stories, I cried when I listened to their songs. How beautiful it is to share the experience with someone without even knowing their story? That’s when it hit me that music is so powerful and that even if one person could resonate with my album, that was all I wanted.\n\n“I wanted the album to be a blanket of safety, love and catharsis that could help not just me, but also my listeners’ own grief journeys.”\n\nOn May 19, exactly a year after Mr Shrinivas summited Mount Everest, she released her album comprising five tracks: “May 19th”, “his time | he’s time”, “my stoneheart”, “this too shall pass” and “a prayer for mySelf”.\n\nOn top of composing and arranging the music, Ms Sushma sang and played the guitar and violin. Her long-time friend and local poet Jaya Rathakrishnan co-wrote ‘May 19th’ and provided additional lyrics for ‘this too shall pass’. Other renowned musicians – such as R. K. Shriramkumar and Sean Roldan – also contributed to the five tracks.\n\nThe dark, mystical vibe of the album – which is sung in Tamil – embodies the immeasurable pain Ms Sushma encountered. “The music says everything that I find difficult to say in words.”\n\nIn the track “this too shall pass” for instance, prominent sounds of a front-door lock opening and a vacuum cleaner whirring are fragments of Mr Shrinivas, said Ms Sushma.\n\n“Shri loved technology. Our house is all Google-automated, even the water heater has a digital switch. Whenever he returned home, he would open the door, Latte would run to him, he would turn on the heater and the vacuum cleaner. Now, I follow that routine.\n\n“I am living in a place that constantly reminds me of him and everything that has happened, but this too shall pass.”\n\nVisual design for ‘THE MOUNTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY’.\n\nPhoto:  V.

Mr Gandhi’s father, grandmother and great-grandfather have all been prime ministers.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr Gandhi, with close-cropped black hair and a scruffy salt-and-pepper stubble, cris-crossed the country as his party’s main face, even though the Congress is led by family loyalist Mallikarjun Kharge.\n\n“I think Rahul Gandhi will get credit, not just for mobilisation, for his marches, but also for continuously clarifying the Congress’s ideological pitch against the BJP,” said Mr Rahul Verma, political analyst at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. “If there was a moment when Gandhi really emerged, it is now,” he said.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Gandhi pulled out a red-jacketed, pocket-sized version of the country’s constitution that he has referred to continuously during the campaign, and said his alliance’s performance was the “first step” in preventing Mr Modi from attempting to change it.\n\nChanging the constitution requires a two-third majority in Parliament.\n\nThe Cambridge-educated Mr Gandhi has often said he is battling Mr Modi’s BJP not just to wrest power, but to defeat the party’s and its parent Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s Hindu-first character, which goes against India’s secular roots enshrined in the constitution.\n\n“My fight is with the ideology of RSS and BJP which is a threat to our country. The hatred these people spread, they spread violence, I fight against it...

But for his new film Chandu Champion, which releases today, he had to do something radically different: Lose 18kg for a ripped body.\n\nThe 33-year-old plays India’s first Paralympic gold-medallist Muralikant Petkar and had to dedicate 18 months of training and weight-loss towards the project.\n\n“It’s a once in a lifetime chance to play this sort of character, and I would go to any level to actually portray this character well,” he told Gulf News.\n\nKartik’s ripped image in Chandu Champion was the result of a strict diet and training regime.

The INDIA alliance led by Mr Rahul Gandhi’s centrist Congress party won 230 seats, more than expected.\n\nMr Modi is set to meet President Droupadi Murmu today to present his claim to form a government and the swearing-in could take place over the weekend, an NDA leader said. Local media earlier reported that the swearing-in ceremony was scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nFollowing the closer-than-expected election, newspapers said Mr Modi’s aura had dimmed, with the Indian Express’s banner headline reading: “India gives NDA a third term, Modi a message.”\n\nThe BJP lost heavily in two bellwether states, its northern stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 seats, and the western state of Maharashtra, which sends 48 members to the decision-making lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe result may not necessarily mean reform paralysis, the chairman of a government finance panel, Arvind Panagariya, wrote in an article in the Economic Times newspaper.\n\n“Despite the reduced majority in Parliament, the necessary reforms are entirely feasible. Delivering sustained growth at a accelerated pace can only strengthen the government’s hand in the coming years,” he wrote.\n\nHowever, one central question hovers over the formation of the next government: Can Mr Modi rule a government dependent on other parties, something he has never done before?\n\n“This is an unknown,” said Mr Neelanjan Sircar, a political scientist at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) in New Delhi. “Modi has only been known to work as a leader with absolute centralised power.”\n\n“The ‘Modi phenomenon’ is based on a particular form of governance. Him having to compromise with allies is not a Modi we know, or a Modi he has sold.”\n\nSpeaking to party supporters at the BJP headquarters on Tuesday, Mr Modi credited Mr Nitish Kumar, the leader of the JD(U) for leading the ruling alliance to big wins in Bihar. Yet the two politicians have long navigated a love-hate relationship, with frequent break-ups and patch-ups. The JD(U) has won 12 seats.\n\nThe TDP too has dallied with both the BJP and the opposition Congress at different times. Unlike the BJP, both the JD(U) and TDP also tout their secular credentials, count on the support of Muslim voters and keep a distance from the BJP’s Hindu majoritarian politics. The TDP has won 16 seats.\n\nWith the election result, “Brand Modi” has suffered a setback, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai. But the results have also made “the politics of alliance a compulsion for Modi”, he said, taking India back to the pre-2014 era when coalition governments were the norm.\n\n“This will be difficult for Modi because allies come with certain expectations, including important positions,” said Kidwai, adding that Mr Modi’s bargaining skills would now be tested under a coalition government.\n\nThose expectations, he said, could include demands from allies for the post of speaker in Parliament and important portfolios. Though the speaker mostly has a ceremonial role, it becomes critical if members of Parliament are looking to break a party.\n\nAllies will also seek key cabinet positions, said analysts. “The game will be to keep allies happy and give up ministerial berths, however, ministers do not mean a lot in this government, as we have seen,” said the CPR’s Sircar.\n\nYet, Mr Modi will need to accommodate enough of those demands if he is to keep a governing coalition in place, said Modi biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay.\n\n“There is no other option for Modi – if he wants to behave the way he has behaved for the last 10 years, he will have to vacate office,” said Mr Mukhopadhyay. “Modi will need to come up with a personality that is humble and open to working with others – a side of him we have never seen.”\n\nWithin the BJP too, Mr Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, his confidant, could face questions over the centralised hold over power, said Mr Kidwai. The TDP also reportedly wants Mr Shah removed from the Home ministry.\n\n“The internal fissures will become triggers now – it is not the same India as before June 4,” said Mr Kidwai. “This will change contemporary politics fundamentally.”\n\nReuters\n\n“The INDIA bloc will continue to fight against the fascist rule of the BJP, led by Modi.”\n\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/92cc366865c6e61e5f2f3654a8636c5474094018592f1b5a576ee4d88963bfe1?w=825", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi with key allies, TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar."}]}

The team comprised members of Just Walk Lah (JWL), a community of brisk and race walkers that was formed in 2022.\n\nAmong the three women in the team was Ms Geetha Nallappan, who completed the walk in 3 hours, 41 minutes and 11 seconds – well in advance of the 5-hour cut-off time.\n\nThe 52-year-old said: “It was not an easy walk and it tested my endurance level. Walking barefoot was a new experience for me, so completing it successfully on my first attempt is something I’m proud of at this age.”\n\nThis was not the first time Ms Geetha, who works in an administrative role at a school, had her name recorded by the Singapore Book of Records. Last November, at the Let’s Take A Walk charity event\n\n,\n\nshe was one of 17 walkers who set the record for “largest group to complete a 100km walk”.\n\nThe man who started JWL is veteran Singaporean racewalker R Subramaniam, 61, also one of the 13 people who achieved the record.\n\nA runner in his younger days, he started race walking at the age of 15, drawing inspiration from his brother-in-law R Nadarajan, who won nine South-east Asian Games medals in racewalking between 1973 and 1983.\n\n“I wanted to create an opportunity for walking enthusiasts to enter the Singapore Book of Records,” said Mr Subramaniam.\n\n“Walking a half marathon is actually easy. But to do it barefoot is a big challenge, and not many can or would want to do it.\n\n“We all have blisters. It’s been close to a month and they haven’t fully healed. One of our runners had a blood clot in his toenail. Yet, we pushed on. That’s the mental grit that we have.”\n\nHe first started JWL as a solution to the dwindling number of competitions for race walking.\n\n“Compared to the early 2000s, there are very few community events for racewalking now. In my younger days, community centres organised race walks, and every week or two there would be a race,” he said.\n\n“From 1991 to 2016 there was a very popular The New Paper Big Walk. We don’t see those types of races anymore. So many racewalkers lose their motivation to train.”\n\nLast July, JWL organised a 5km Race Walk at Marina Promontory, which saw close to 100 participants.\n\nCome November, at this year’s Let’s Take A Walk event, JWL hopes to set another record with the “largest team to walk 50km”, Mr Subramaniam said.\n\n“Last year, we set the record for 100km, so this year we are looking at 50km.

Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nThe pink life-sized banner belonging to Bama’s Kitchen outside the Trio shopping mall in Sam Leong Road on the outskirts of Little India grabs your attention from metres away. On it is the striking bold claim: “First in Singapore: Duck Biryani”.\n\nIt’s enough to pique my interest.\n\nWhile I am no stranger to duck – being born and raised in the all-encompassing food paradise that is Singapore – I am cognisant of the fact that duck meat is rarely an option in Indian cuisine.\n\nCultural factors, availability, taste preferences – whatever the reason, the fatty bird just isn’t consumed in India as much as other meats like chicken, mutton and fish.\n\nDuck is particularly prominent in Chinese cuisine, most notably in the form of Peking duck, where the crispy roasted skin is wrapped with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce in a small spring pancake.\n\nPerhaps just as popular is the French duck confit, where the duck leg is slow-cooked in duck fat until the meat is meltingly tender, and the skin crisped to golden succulence.\n\nPeking and confit, yes. But duck biryani? What would the Mughals, who introduced biryani to India more than 100 years ago, have thought?\n\nFrom the exterior, Bama’s Kitchen looks more like a pub than a restaurant, what with its well-decorated (and stocked) bar overlooking no more than eight or nine tables.\n\nThere are no customers at 11am, though the owner, who wishes to be known only as Ms Bama, 77, tells me that many of her customers are from tour groups. Indeed, her duck biryani recipe was made with such patrons in mind.\n\n“We get a lot of Chinese customers, and they are mostly the ones who order the duck,” she says. “Indians, no. They don’t eat it.”\n\nWe Indians are a people of many quirks and traits, I tell her. But being adventurous with food has never been one of them.\n\nShe nods in agreement.\n\nAt first sight, Bama’s duck biryani looked like basmati rice slathered in korma. At first bite, however, there was no mistaking the biryani fragrance and spices. The rice is cooked separately, then mixed with the masala-stewed duck inside a pot during the final cooking phase.\n\nThis was a very light style of biryani, almost a “healthy version of it” – if such an oxymoron could even exist. There is no MSG, preservative or artificial colouring (saffron isn’t always necessary) to the dish, and the green chilli masala complements the flavourful breast meat.\n\nThere are some who opine – in hyperbolic fashion – that duck is closer to steak than chicken. The meat is darker and drier than chicken, and the fat content is quite rich.\n\nI like to think of duck meat as the best of both worlds. And while some duck dishes – especially those served at French restaurants – may have a gamey flavour, Bama’s duck biryani has no such issue.\n\n“We’ve had this dish on our menu since we opened in 2019,” said Ms Bama, who also runs Lady Fair Beauty Centre in Upper Dickson Road. She has been in the salon business for over 30 years.\n\n“It was our best-selling dish before Covid hit, but everything’s on and off now. It’s still popular though, especially with the tourists.”\n\nSome 2km away in North Bridge Road is a restaurant almost a century older than Bama’s Kitchen. Self-styled as the “great-grandfather” of biryani in Singapore, Islamic was founded in 1921, and was one of the first restaurants to serve the dish here.\n\nThe cosy two-storey shophouse space is adorned with heirlooms from Singapore’s colonial history and photos of owner Kalil A. Wahab’s grandfather and father, who started and ran the business respectively.\n\nInterestingly, Mr Kalil, 62, who took charge of the business in 2008, also collects replicas of ducks – his favourite animal.\n\n“I like ducks because when you see them in a pond, they look calm and peaceful and happy. But underneath the water, they are paddling furiously; we don’t see their struggles,” the well-spoken Mr Kalil explains.\n\n“Sometimes it’s like that with people too – we see them happy and successful, but beneath the surface they’re working hard and struggling, and we don’t see that.”\n\nMr Kalil furrowed his brow when I told him of the unique and rare combination of duck and biryani found at Bama’s Kitchen. He then points to a receipt on the wall from 1962, that shows “duck” on the menu.\n\n“We’ve been serving duck biryani here since then,” he says. “During Covid-19, we made it available just once a week on Fridays; but now it’s back on the menu every day – both here and our Desker Road branch.”\n\nIslamic’s nasi biryani is not as rich and fiery as the Indian version. Instead, it draws on Middle Eastern influences for its secret blend of about 25 spices for the meat marinade.\n\nThe duck is slow-cooked in an oven overnight “for consistency” Mr Kalil informs. Perhaps more significantly, the version served here keeps the skin on the bird.\n\nDuck fat, or skin in this instance, is called gold by everyone who knows its powers. It has a flavour profile not replicated by any other meat, and to serve duck without it would be akin to playing football without the goalposts – you could still have a kickabout, but really what’s the point?\n\nFor that reason alone, Islamic’s duck biryani, with its thicker and spicier masala, gets the nod over Bama’s – though the latter’s rice was just as tasty if not slightly better.\n\nAfter the last scoop of rice, I am reminded of the current hubbub over butter chicken between two restaurants in India, where both lay claim over its origins during the 1940s. The dispute has even gone to the courts in New Delhi.\n\nIn the case of the duck saga here, Islamic has a receipt to back up its claim.\n\n“Our customers know that we serve duck biryani, and many do order it – Malays, Chinese, even Indians,” says Mr Kalil.\n\n“It’s the same with our Mysore mutton,” he adds. “My grandfather created it in 1921, while Apolo Banana Leaf and Muthu’s Curry started serving their versions in the 70s.”\n\nI felt obliged, of course, to update Ms Bama on the situation. If anything, to see if she would withdraw her claim of serving the “First Duck Biryani in Singapore”.\n\n“That’s a joke man, nobody’s heard of it before,” was her reply over the phone.\n\n“(Islamic) only started selling it recently. Maybe, they sold it back then, then stopped and restarted again recently, but nobody heard of it even in the early 2000s.\n\n“When we introduced our dish, people also reacted in a way that indicated we were the first.”\n\nIf anyone’s thinking of starting a squid or scallop biryani dish, they best copyright it.\n\nThe chef at Bama’s Kitchen serving duck biryani.\n\nPhotos: T.

It was around 9 deg C so it was cold and hard to breathe, completely different from playing in Singapore,” said Joshua.\n\n“We landed in London three days before the tournament and started jogging in the mornings to get acclimated to the weather. It was a tough and tiring competition but it was all worth it when we won.”\n\nLa Plata went unbeaten the entire tournament –  which featured 12 teams from various countries – winning all five group-stage matches before beating Hong Kong 4-2 in the semi-final and Australia 2-0 in the final.\n\nVisva Manivannan, 22, who emerged as the player of the tournament after scoring six goals, said their toughest match was against Hong Kong.\n\n“They had excellent footwork and also used their keeper as an outfield player, which we did not expect,” said Visva. “It took us some time to understand their style before we could counter it, but we managed to do so.”\n\nThe six players in the team had been playing together in social leagues for a few years before they were talent scouted last year by Louis Amalorpavanathan, president of Tengah FC, to play semi-professional football.\n\nLast year, Tengah were runners-up in the Football Association of Singapore Islandwide League, the fourth-tier of football, featuring mostly amateur players and teams. They are now preparing for the Singapore Football League 2 (SFL 2) – football’s third-tier.\n\nLouis, 53, said Tengah FC was formed with the goal of playing professionally in the Singapore Premier League (SPL).\n\nAhead of the 2024-25 SPL season in March, the team had announced on social media their bid to turn professional and compete in the league. But a tight deadline meant the club could not get the process done in time and will instead ready itself for the 2025-26 season.\n\n“A good run in this year’s SFL 2 will be a huge confidence booster as we bid again to enter the SPL again next season,“ said Louis, who owns a security and investigation firm.\n\n“We want to give these boys a chance to play professional football and hopefully get them to the national team.\n\n“There are many youngsters on this team who were formerly at-risk youth, but have placed their trust in football to improve their livelihoods and that is what we aim to do for them.”\n\nBy Yugesh Kannan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/61d778b4d928c679d4aa7bac8acd02279789b889497c29cda088f0172311f0c7?w=825", "alt_text": "The Tengah FC players who won the AIA London Grand Final 2024 in London on May 13, while playing for La Plata Jrs.

A popular kampung pastime in the 60s and 70s – among boys especially – it involves catching spiders, housing them in empty matchboxes and pitting them against each other.\n\nNo money changed hands, but there was much pride at stake. We would show off our spiders with very much the same degree of pompousness as a Roman nobleman would display his gladiators.\n\nFinding a spider was easy. If you see a web, you would have likely found one.\n\nUsing a plucked leaf, we would gently push to get it to jump onto our hand, then coax it to enter the matchbox. This requires some patience since picking up a spider could quash it.\n\nThe arena for a spider fight would be a leaf atop an empty tin or placed on the floor. Being territorial, the spiders would rush at each other to establish dominance. As in most fights, the bigger, faster or more aggressive contender will prevail.\n\nIn a local spider derby, the loser will immediately turn tail and the fight is over. Unlike in Japan, where the fight is to the death and the winner won’t hesitate to kill a stubborn rival.\n\nChampion spiders were prized possessions. We took care of them better than we did ourselves.\n\nTo enhance the decor of the inside of the matchbox, we would add a leaf or two. To feed our arachnid gladiators, we would stun houseflies with our rubber slippers – the standard leisure footwear of that era.\n\nWe would go everywhere with our spiders, distressing our sisters at home and the girls at school.\n\nWhile the appeal of this pastime has waned, there is a group of childhood friends who still follow their passion even in their adult years.\n\nThese diehards administer a Facebook group that has more than 1,000 members scattered across Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.\n\nBefore Covid-19, they would travel every year to meet up with regional friends to go on spider hunts and stage fights.\n\nToday’s children have the Internet and their avatars for the innumerable video games available, but I might want to acquaint my grandson with the joy of spider fighting.\n\nFat hope – his mother is a true-blue, I mean solid-green, environmentalist.\n\nBy Khush Randhawa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d771bb94bb529796868c57f0cd584ac28d7c158fcb37a963f5ed78d681c8a7b7?w=825", "alt_text": "The “loser” is the spider which gives up on the fight and runs away."}]}

Based on true events.”\n\nAccording to Netflix, the storyline draws inspiration from the 1862 Maharaja Libel Case.\n\nJunaid portrays Karsandas Mulji, a journalist and social reformer known for advocating women’s rights and social change.\n\nThe synopsis shared by the streaming giant reads: “The year is 1862, a time when there were only three universities in India, Rabindranath Tagore is a year old and the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 continues to fan the flames of independence. Against all odds, one man takes a courageous stand in a landmark legal battle, a true story that’s now come to light in Maharaj – more than 160 years later.\n\n“A student at Elphinstone College in Mumbai and a protege of the scholar-leader Dadabhai Naoroji, Mulji wrote on widow remarriage, stood up for the oppressed and sowed the seeds of reform in society.\n\n“It all came to a head in the Maharaj Libel Case of 1862, which was ignited by allegations of misconduct by a prominent figure. The case garnered widespread attention and scrutiny, setting the stage for what many consider to be one of the most significant legal battles of all time.”\n\nMulji’s writings on widow remarriage and his efforts to uplift the oppressed were instrumental in sparking societal reform. However, certain Hindu organisations have expressed concerns about the film, alleging that it portrays Hindu saints in a negative light.\n\nThey are particularly aggrieved by the labeling of a leader of the Vallabha sect as a sex maniac and are reportedly planning to protest against the film.\n\nDirected by Siddharth P Malhotra, Maharaj is backed by Yash Raj Films.

Santosh Kumar\n\nSpectator interest in the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies and United States has been tepid. This is mainly because of the high ticket prices.\n\nBut the scenario is bound to change when India play Pakistan in New York on Sunday (10.30pm Singapore time). It is expected to be a full-house, with some fans reportedly willing to fork out US$20,000 ($27,000) for a seat.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have a storied sporting rivalry. But they rarely engage in a bilateral series these days because of political issues.\n\nSo, for fans of the two national teams, them engaging in a battle for honours in a major tournament on a neutral ground is a big reason to buy a ticket whatever the cost and enjoy the proceedings.\n\nT20 is slam-bang cricket. The shortest format of the sport is mainly aggressive batting, bowling and fielding over 160 minutes, often producing spectacular outcomes.\n\nBut it can also throw up unexpected results, only taking a batter to play out of his skin or a bowler to hit unplayable lengths to turn a match around.\n\nOn current form, India are favoured to beat Pakistan. Their players have arrived after the demanding Indian Premier League and thrashed Bangladesh in a warm-up game and Ireland in India’s World Cup opener on Wednesday.\n\nBoth matches were at the 37,000-capacity Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in East Meadow, the venue for the India-Pakistan clash.\n\nOn the other hand, Pakistan have had an unsettling captaincy change, with batsman Babar Azam recently replacing fast-bowler Shaheen Afridi.\n\nThe team have not fared well in recent T20 matches, losing to Ireland and England. They were also scheduled to play a solid-looking US side on Thursday night (Singapore time).\n\nBut the Pakistanis are doughty fighters and will surely unite and lift their game against India.\n\nLike most India-Pakistan matches, it is mainly going to be a contest between India’s batters and Pakistan’s fast bowlers.\n\nIndia’s batting line-up, led by captain Rohit Sharma, the prolific Virat Kohli and world No. 1 T20 batter Suryakumar Yadav, includes a plethora of left-handers. Pakistan are heavily dependent on the seasoned Babar and wicket-keeper Mohammed Rizwan for runs.\n\nIt is in the speed bowling area that Pakistan have the upper hand, with Shaheen, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir having the ability to rip through any innings.\n\nBut, though Pakistan have experienced spinner Shadab Khan, India’s bowling is more balanced. Led by the world No. 1 T20 bowler Jasprit Bumrah and the quick Mohammed Siraj, they also have crafty spinners in Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav.\n\nIndia have lost only once to Pakistan at the T20 World Cup in seven meetings – their only defeat coming in 2021 when the Kohli-led side lost by 10 wickets at the Super 12 stage.\n\nThe last time they met, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2022, Kohli single-handedly took India to victory by smashing an undefeated 82 off just 53 deliveries in what is widely rated as among the greatest knocks in T20 World Cup history.\n\nOn Sunday, any batting heroics could be limited because of the excessive seam movement and bounce on the New York drop-in pitch.\n\nIn the two World Cup matches held there, the team batting first, Sri Lanka and Ireland, were not able to score more than 96 runs, and most top-order batsmen were seen fumbling, ducking and weaving because of the unpredictable bounce.\n\nThe pitches, brought in from Australia, are underprepared and haven’t had the time to bed in. Pitch No. 1 was used for the first time when Sri Lanka batted on it. They were bowled out for 77 and South Africa sweated in the chase. The pitch that hosted Ireland’s 96 all out against India was being used for only the second time.\n\nIndia showed their bowling prowess on the New York pitch on Wednesday. Pakistan have quicker bowlers with higher release points, making it an even bigger challenge for batters.\n\nPerhaps two menacing bowling attacks will even out the toss advantage. Then the likelihood is a low-scoring thriller.\n\nBy V. K.

It has about 60 employees and operates out of Bengaluru.\n\n“My time with Autodesk, Grab and Singapore Press Holdings was fulfilling,” he told tabla!. “I helped in their digital transformation and subscriptions growth, but I also wanted to take up a fresh challenge in the technology industry I’m in.\n\n“It was not only a product and technology challenge, but also a mindset challenge.”\n\nOn his new venture, Mr Sachdeva said the Indian stock market has a lot of potential for growth.\n\n“The Indian stock market is valued at about US$4 trillion ($5.38 trillion) and it recently surpassed even Hong Kong. But the percentage of Indians investing in stocks is less than 4 per cent.\n\n“This is because Indians are taught to save money and not to grow their wealth. They are fearful of venturing into the stock market after losing a few lakhs.\n\n“So, with StockGro we want to teach people, especially the 400 million Gen Z in India, that the stock market is a place for them to apply their skill and grow their wealth.”\n\nApplying fintech, StockGro shows how to invest in the stock market in a very experiential way. The preparation zone helps people build a portfolio using virtual money in a risk-free environment. Then there are a host of experts who give tips. Theoretical knowledge is also provided in the form of bite-sized content.\n\nLaunched in 2020, StockGro has more than 35 million monthly active users. The initial learning is free. Later on, as people progress to actual trading, there are subscription tiers.\n\nMr Sachdeva, who now works remotely from Singapore, said his 10 years working for companies in the Republic has helped him tremendously with what he has to do at StockGro.\n\n“I came to Singapore in January 2014 and began working with American software corporation Autodesk where I set up its first product team and worked on subscriptions related product features,” he said\n\n“Two years later, I got an opportunity to work at Grab, where I was involved in its product development and growing the small business into a large business.\n\n“At SPH (in 2018), I relished the challenge that the media company offered: Transforming an old monopoly business into a model digital company.”\n\nInitially, it was difficult for Mr Sachdeva at SPH because “everybody thought it is a well-oiled machine and were not willing to listen to a 37-year-old who was trying to tell them how to run their business differently”.\n\nBut, over time, he managed to “change mindsets”.\n\n“Along with deputy CEO Anthony Tan we built the digital media products group within the media business,” he said.\n\n“We set up a product team and a design team from scratch. We brought analytics and data science into the organisation and we reinvented how products were done within the different papers and even radio and advertising.\n\n“There was this diversity of customer segments and consumer behaviours I was exposed to, while developing the product and engineering teams.\n\n“During that process, I got to work closely with the newsrooms in convincing them why they should listen to us and how we can work together and grow the circulation of not only the print newspapers but also the digital newspapers.\n\n“Those five years of my life from 2018 to 2023 were really exciting, very challenging and full of learning – lots of battle scars which I’m proud of. I have to give huge thanks to the opportunities I got while working at SPH.”\n\nIn 2022, SPH went through a restructuring that prompted Mr Sachdeva to consider if he wanted to take up another challenge.\n\n“At that point, I had a conversation with Ajay Lakhotia whom I had met through some investors in 2018. He was building his own company and needed somebody who could do product design and help in other areas.\n\n“I decided it was time for me to jump back into the start-up world and help build an organisation.”\n\nMr Sachdeva visits Bengaluru to oversee the business growth and product development.\n\n“Actually, I love living in Singapore,” he said. “It’s a very welcoming country and food is never a problem, even for a vegetarian. I have Chinese and Malay friends and have absorbed the local culture. It has been a journey of enrichment.\n\n“I came as a bachelor and got married to my wife Jyotika while in Singapore.

She then spent most of her time in the south, acting predominantly in Tamil and Telugu films.\n\nThe 45-year-old actress returned to Hindi films this year with Shaitaan and Srikanth, which was a great surprise to her “because it happened very organically”.\n\n“For 25 years, there was no sound, and suddenly these two films made such noise,” she told the Hindustan Times. “I have obviously returned during the best phase of Indian cinema.\n\n“There is no North-South divide any more and the audience is looking at everything as one. But in Bollywood, I am still waiting for the kind of roles I am used to doing down South.\n\n“I chose to be a part of Shaitaan and Srikanth because they are beautiful stories, but I am looking for more as an actor in terms of the length of my role in a Hindi film.”\n\nJyotika has actually seen the best and worst of both worlds. When she went to the South, not many people there were watching Hindi films. And in the North, a lot of fun was made of South cinema.\n\nBut things have changed.\n\n“On the sets of Shaitaan, me and (actor) R. Madhavan (who is Tamil) were given so much respect,” said Jyotika. “Ajay (Devgn, actor) made us feel equal to him and the team recognised us as big actors from the South, instead of thinking of us as regional actors. We could see love for the South that had penetrated through Bollywood, and it was mutual.”\n\nHowever, the actress, who is married to Tamil star Suriya, admits that even today, Bollywood often sticks to stereotypical portrayals of South Indians.\n\n“I agree some things are done over the top there,” she told the Hindustan Times. “We love the idli-sambar and we love action films, but sometimes how it is depicted here is definitely overdone.\n\n“We’ve had actors in Hindi also who have had their own style of overdoing things. But Rajinikanth sir has been taken to another level (referring to the mocking of Rajinikanth’s style of acting and memes on his mannerisms).\n\n“It might be done in good spirits, but frankly they do get it wrong most of the time.”\n\nJyotika said she looked for work in Bollywood after her debut, but it did not work out, and she had to move South.\n\n“It was very upsetting. There were many girls who came in around the time I debuted, including Kareena (Kapoor), Rani (Mukerji) and Preity (Zinta). All of them were introduced by big banners, and so was I, but they were the lucky ones whose films worked, and they went forward.\n\n“I realised it wasn’t working out for me. The game is that you have to have your first film as a blockbuster or a hit. The actor in you is recognised only after that.\n\n“Luckily, I had one film down South. It didn’t do well either, but they recognised my talent. That is a little difference I saw in both industries.”\n\nAccording to Jyotika, moving to Chennai and then getting married to Suriya made many in Mumbai assume she wasn’t keen on returning to the Hindi film industry.\n\n“People in Bollywood also thought that since I was a South Indian, I didn’t want to do Hindi films anymore,” she told News 18. “It’s not like I refrained from doing a Hindi film. It’s just that I wasn’t offered any script in so many years.”\n\nRajkummar Rao’s Srikanth marked her second release following her Bollywood comeback with Shaitaan.\n\nBut she was worried on the first day of its shoot.\n\n“It was very nostalgic for me to even speak in Hindi because I had left speaking the language a while ago,” she said. “I was very nervous on the first two days. I did a lot of bad acting on the first day. I kept pinching myself that I’m back to Bollywood.”\n\nHowever, playing a person from South India in Srikanth eased her into the process eventually.\n\n“I was also very emotional because in the film, I had a certain connect with South – what a way it was to restart my journey. I thought it was a beautiful blend of both worlds for me to begin with.”\n\n“I agree some things are done over the top there. We love the idli-sambar and we love action films, but sometimes how it is depicted here is definitely overdone.”\n\nJyotika, who returned to Hindi films this year with Shaitaan and Srikanth", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/239dc00f6d9d677bf7f6e6083268e778ecb68de14a231d28fe4fae24e902db2d?w=825", "alt_text": "Actress Jyotika."}]}

Food and beverages sales, which comprises 33 per cent of the total, fell 6.1 per cent.\n\nAs a result, PVR Inox’s overall revenue fell almost 9 per cent to Rs11.91 billion.\n\nHollywood offered no respite either, as the industry saw fewer releases due to delays from a writers’ strike last year.\n\nHollywood content has been delayed by four to eight months due to the strike, said Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara Capital.\n\nOn June 27, Kalki became the biggest movie of the year, contributing nearly 16 per cent to the quarterly box office in just four days and grossing over Rs1,000 crore globally to date.\n\n“With Kalki’s continued success and a promising line-up ahead across languages, Q2 has begun on a positive note, said PVR Inox’s managing director Ajay Bijli.\n\n“There are no significant events expected in the near future to disrupt the release schedule. Additionally, Hollywood is expected to bounce back, as the effects of the writer and actor strikes are beginning to diminish.

Kavi\n\nஆ. விஷ்ணு வர்தினி\n\nAt the cusp of its centennial milestone, the sky is not the limit for Ananda Bhavan – the cosmos is.\n\n“Dare I dream big, I wish to see Ananda Bhavan’s signature masala thosai become the first Indian vegetarian dish to be savoured on the moon,” said third-generation chief executive Viren Ettikan, as he sits at the helm of this culinary spaceship.\n\nThe 39-year-old was handed the ropes in 2011, amid rumours of the restaurant’s imminent closure and declining food quality.\n\nAs a young CEO with little full-time business experience, Mr Viren was faced with the challenge of rebuilding customer trust while transforming Indian vegetarian cuisine into a “cool” and “trendy” choice for a younger clientele.\n\nWhile his dreams for Ananda Bhavan and the moon may seem a tad far-fetched, his underlying ambition is to expand the restaurant’s customer base internationally. His vision of masala thosai being served on the moon symbolises the restaurant’s passion for sharing the love of vegetarian cuisine with the world.\n\nAnanda Bhavan opened its doors in 1924, at the pre-war Ellison building on 221 Selegie Road. Founded by Mr Kulanthaivelu Muthusamy, the restaurant became a nexus for the tramway and bus depot workers, and the Indian community at large. It now has five outlets across the island.\n\nThe restaurant celebrated its 100th anniversary on July 20, when it also received acknowledgement from the Singapore Book of Records as the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.\n\nAt its Little India outlet at 95 Syed Alwi Road, the eatery hosted more than 100 guests, including patrons, business partners, family members and community leaders.\n\nA specially curated 100-year menu was unveiled in the presence of President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his wife Jane Ittogi and Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Alvin Tan.\n\nAnanda Bhavan weathered colonial rule, the Japanese occupation during World War II and the tumultuous merger years. Its enduring legacy is cemented by a steadfast embrace of innovation while demonstrating its commitment to the community.\n\nService robots, for instance, have been greeting customers at its Syed Alwi outlet for the past three years. The restaurant’s menu too has evolved, with Jain and Indo-Chinese specialties offered alongside its signature South Indian dishes.\n\nDuring Covid-19, Ananda Bhavan stepped up its community efforts and donated snacks and food to migrant workers. Chef Manikkam Thennarasu recalled preparing almost 100,000 murukkus in 10 days.\n\n“Positive relationships are at the heart of Ananda Bhavan’s service,” said Mr Thennarasu, 54, who has worked at Ananda Bhavan for the past 18 years.\n\nHe highlighted the initial “unlearning” for staff that was required inside the restaurant’s kitchen, where the core principles of “no added MSG, no artificial preservatives and no reuse of cooking oil” must be adhered to.\n\n“At Ananda Bhavan, almost every occasion calls for an innovative special menu,” said Mr Thennarasu.\n\n“People usually think non-vegetarian food has the most scope. But in fact, vegetarian cuisine actually has a greater variety and room for creativity. We can play around with it more.”\n\nAnanda Bhavan Restaurant was awarded the “Longest Serving Indian Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore” by the Singapore Book of Records.\n\nPhoto: T.Kavi\n\n“I wish to see Ananda Bhavan’s signature masala thosai become the first Indian vegetarian dish to be savoured on the moon.”\n\nAnanda Bhavan CEO Viren Ettikan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/701add74114bcc61f257cce892ee5cecb5d9555371b2427f54801cc7a0721e6a?w=825", "alt_text": "President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his wife Jane Ittogi with Ananda Bhavan CEO Viren Ettikan at the restaurant’s centennial celebrations on July 20."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIf Ms Kamala Harris gets the Democratic party nomination next month to run for the United States presidency, it will be a historic and meaningful moment for every Indian, said Hindi literature professor Shivaji Shinde.\n\n“The United States is the most powerful country in the world. If they choose an Indian-origin person as their president, then it will be a huge moment for India and every Indian would be immensely proud,” he said in New Delhi on Tuesday.\n\nAlready, people in Thulasendrapuram, a village in Tamil Nadu where her mother’s family once lived, are celebrating, reported AFP. Resident Sudhakar Jayaraman said villagers performed prayers at the local temple, which Ms Harris and her grandfather once donated to, after they heard the news.\n\n“We’re overjoyed to know that someone who traces her ancestry to our village might become the president of the United States,” Mr Jayaraman said.\n\nHowever, while Ms Harris works to become the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden ended his campaign, reactions across other parts in India have been rather muted in comparison. While there is pride, many believe she has preferred to emphasise her Jamaican heritage throughout her vice-presidency.\n\nHer father was born in Jamaica and she prefers to project herself as Black, only deploying stories of her ties to India at key moments – at times light-heartedly.\n\nIn June last year, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a state visit to Washington, Ms Harris spoke emotionally about her ties to her late mother Shyamala Gopalan’s country of birth.\n\nShe credited her grandfather P.V. Gopalan, who was a civil servant, with teaching her about what democracy means as they walked hand-in-hand on a beach in his home state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nThese lessons, she said, “first inspired my interest in public service… and have guided me ever since”.\n\nShe also talked about her mother’s influence – and how she discovered her “love of good idli”.\n\nBut, beyond a smattering of references, analysts say Ms Harris hasn’t tapped her Indian identity heavily.\n\nStill, if she becomes the Democratic nominee to fight against the Republican party’s Donald Trump, it would be a first for a South Asian American – and a sign of just how far the diaspora has come in the US.\n\nMs Harris and a slew of other political personalities with roots in India – from Ms Nikki Haley and Mr Vivek Ramaswamy to Ms Usha Vance – have become household names in the US, and their rise has put a spotlight on India, beyond the cliches of Bollywood and butter chicken.\n\nBut for Ms Harris, it is important to get the backing of Indian-Americans as she aims to become the US president in an extremely tight presidential race, noted American website Axios.\n\nDemocrats saw Black and Asian-American voting blocs’ enthusiasm wane when President Biden was at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nMr Trump himself has tried to court Black and Hispanic voters this year, but he remains extremely unpopular among those demographics.\n\nA recent Asian-American voter survey found that while 46 per cent of the demographic would vote for Mr Biden versus 31 per cent for Trump, it’s still eight points lower than the 54 per cent who favoured Mr Biden in 2020.\n\nThe first Reuters/Ipsos poll since Ms Harris took Mr Biden’s mantle has her leading Trump 44 per cent to 42 among all voters in a head-to-head race, but she still has much to do to get the Blacks’ and Indian-Americans’ support.\n\nAmong the Indian-Americans – and more broadly Asian-American – her candidacy has sparked excitement, Prof Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American studies at Amherst College in Massachusetts, told Axios.\n\n“Enthusiasm about her candidacy is higher now than in 2019, as voters have gotten to know her as vice-president,” he said. “But her support among Asian-American voters isn’t to be taken for granted.\n\n“She has to talk about the issues that all Americans care about, but in a way that connects with Asian Americans. And then she also has to clarify her stance on certain foreign policy issues that matter to Asian-Americans, like America’s relationship with India.”\n\nIn a way, her possible nomination appears to have galvanised the Indian-American community, which can see in her a symbol of their success and an opportunity to have American politics reflect the diversity of its society.\n\nWithin a day of Ms Harris entering the race, the segment of the Indian-American community that leans Democrat has been quick on its feet in mobilising support for her, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndian American Impact Fund, a key political outfit that has supported 116 Indian-American candidates and raised US$20 million in the last eight years to elevate the community’s political representation, endorsed Ms Harris on Sunday.\n\nImpact’s co-founder Deepak Raj said: “We are ready to leverage our extensive network of resources to mobilise South Asian voters, confident that they will be instrumental in delivering the White House to Kamala Harris in November.”\n\nMr Shekar Narasimhan, the chairman and founder of the AAPI Victory Fund, which supports Asian American candidates, also vouched for Ms Harris’s competence and qualifications.\n\nHe hailed her for recognising the importance of community, diversity and standing up against hate crimes.\n\nReferring to those who sometimes criticise Ms Harris for not owning up to her Indian identity more, Mr Narasimhan said: “She talks about her heritage and that’s enough. Does she have to eat idli, dosa always to be Indian? What does that even mean?”\n\nDemocratic party frontrunner for US presidency Kamala Harris.\n\nPhoto: EPA-EFE\n\n“Enthusiasm about her candidacy is higher now than in 2019, as voters have gotten to know her as vice-president.”\n\nProf Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American studies at Amherst College", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0e6df2abed620fce63043e7990a15a4a5b5e10092f232ad658c670641ca7c7c4?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr J Sudhakar, a local leader, distributing sweets after offering prayers for US Vice-President Kamala Harris at the Sri Dharmasastha temple in her ancestral village of Thulasendrapuram in Tamil Nadu on July 23."}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/india-headed-new-balance", "site_title": "India headed for a new balance", "publish_date": null, "content": "News\n\nIndia headed for a new balance\n\nUPDATED\n\nJun 7, 2024, 5:30 AM\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters celebrate as they watch election election results on a television screen at BJP headquarters in Bangalore.\n\nEPA-EFE\n\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) success in the Indian general elections was hardly ever in doubt.\n\nFew would be surprised by the party’s victory this week, even though the BJP, led by popular Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lost seats to a stronger than expected opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nAfter all, the massive demonetisation exercise of 2016, which was not exactly acclaimed as a success, failed to derail the BJP’s electoral prospects. Likewise, no great harm seems to have been done to the BJP by the government’s less-than-satisfactory handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in the second-largest migration in Indian history after the Partition of India in 1947 (the migration\n\nthis time being that of poor workers in cities returning to their villages). Indians are a forgiving people.\n\nThe BJP, part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, managed to ride out whatever public sentiments went against it by holding on to two tenets.\n\nThe first tenet rests on what is broadly called Hindu nationalism (and its cognate concept, Hindutva). In one assessment, Hindu nationalism is “a political ideology which asserts that Indian national identity and culture are inseparable from the religion of Hinduism”. Hindutva, or Hindu-ness, is a political movement that co-opts the idea of Hindu nationalism to the goal of achieving a Hindu nationalist state in India.\n\nThe second tenet is development. According to the BJP’s website, when a political party talks of development, it often talks of roads, ports, GDP growth, stock markets, agriculture, exports and international trade, among other issues. To the BJP, however, development is all this and much more. At its core, the BJP’s concept of progress means Indians experiencing change that enables them to fulfil their potential.\n\nBoth tents have their roots in reality. One of the great faults of the Indian National Congress, the party of Indian Independence, was perhaps to underestimate the Hindu-ness of Hindu Indians in favour of an eclectically liberal idea of secularism derived from India’s encounter with the modernising colonial British.\n\nThat secular ideal was of course a desirable one morally; indeed, it was necessary, politically, to hold India together after the emergence of Muslim Pakistan following Partition. But Congress’ secularism arguably conceded too much to religiously restive minorities in India through policies of appeasement while withholding from Hindus an equal share of appeasement. The BJP redressed that. Hence its sway on the Hindu mind.\n\nAs for development, the BJP’s formula has succeeded in countering the Congress’ emphasis on state-led growth. That choice, too, was necessary in a poor country whose capital had been drained out by 200 years of British rule. The Nehruvian Model – named after Indian’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru – emphasised the role of the state as the prime enabler of national economic growth.\n\nUnfortunately, the British Raj turned into a Licence Raj where bureaucrats stifled private initiative, particularly entrepreneurship. The results were so obscenely clear by the beginning of the 1990s that the Congress government itself had to turn to privatisation and liberalisation as the answer to India’s economic woes. The BJP continued on the reformist trajectory.\n\nThe BJP developed a winning electoral formula on the basis of these two tenets: Hindu nationalism and private-sector development.\n\nThe election results show that the formula is not working as before. The opposition INDIA alliance, centred on a rejuvenated Congress and its regional allies, has made deep inroads into the corridors of electoral power that belonged overwhelmingly to the BJP and its NDA.\n\nIndia is headed for a new balance. That balance will consist of two tenets as well.\n\nFirst, whatever the faults of the secular liberal constitutionalism promoted by the Congress, Hindu nationalism alienates religious minorities, whose “no” votes in an election add to the number of discontents in the Hindu community itself.\n\nReligious majoritarianism has clear limits in an ethnically diverse country that is also a democracy. Unlike in a theocracy or some other kind of autocracy, democracy has a penchant of bringing disparate but discordant voices together.\n\nSecond, the liberalisation of the Indian economy cannot be oblivious to bread-and-butter issues faced by ordinary Indians, particularly those who inhabit the vast agricultural heartland of what is still an overwhelmingly rural country. There is no macro-economics without micro-economics.\n\nThese two tenets – inclusive nationalism and inclusive economics – will determine the course of India in the coming years.\n\nThis should not come as a surprise. India has survived centuries of challenge from both within its borders and outside them because of its people’s capacity for imaginative thinking and ameliorative change.\n\nIt is up to the new government to encourage that capacity. At the end of the day, what matters is the voice of the people. Those who hear and amplify it win. Others are consigned to the silence of overtaken history.\n\nBy Asad Latif\n\nThe writer is a former\n\nStraits Times journalist.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c45b4ec7011eb8f8cf63abbd6ba60c3f00cff64168d4032a9327b9f00acef7b6?w=825", "alt_text": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters celebrate as they watch election election results on a television screen at BJP headquarters in Bangalore."}]}

It depends on how many chances you create.”\n\nThe crowded top 10 of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) rankings backs Upadhyay’s analysis with the Dutch, Britain, Belgium, Australia, Germany and Argentina all bunched ahead of India.\n\nIndia, who have five debutants in their 16-man squad, will need to finish in the top four of a pool also featuring reigning champions Belgium, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand and Ireland to get into the quarter-finals.\n\n“We are working on our fitness and defensive structure because we all have the mantra ‘defend for the win’,” Upadhyay added.\n\n“India is especially known for our counterattack, so we are looking to defend first. And if you have a good defence then definitely we can have a good attack.”\n\nThe word hockey derives from the French word hocquet, meaning “shepherds crook”, and the July 27 to Aug 9 competition will take place in Colombes at what was the main stadium for the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\nBuilding trust was a key target area for India’s men’s hockey coach Craig Fulton when he took over last year.\n\nThe South African said he is well aware of the expectations that have gone up after the Tokyo performance.\n\n“Yes, I know about the expectations and we are fully prepared for that.

Santosh Kumar\n\nNurses from India prefer working in Singapore because the pay is better, English is the lingua franca and the healthcare system is advanced.\n\nThe environment is safe, weather is good and the country offers a better quality of life, said nurses who spoke to tabla!\n\n“Foreign nurses receive a housing allowance of up to $500 a month, gratuity and joining bonuses,” said a nurse from India who works at a local hospital and did not want to be named.\n\n“We also get a bonus every six months and are eligible for scholarships for higher studies. Many nurses from India stay on, marry and become PRs. But some also see Singapore as a learning and experience base and later seek better opportunities in Europe, the US, Australia, Japan and other countries.”\n\nFor nurses from the small towns and rural areas in India, getting work in Singapore is a “godsend”.\n\nIn India, they typically earn about Rs20,000 ($325) a month even if they work at a big city hospital. In Singapore, they can expect to earn anywhere from $1,800 to $2,500 a month to begin with.\n\nNewspapers in India recently reported that thousands of nurses across the country are keen to come to Singapore and have sought recruiters’ help to get jobs here.\n\nThe demand for more nurses in Singapore is due to a high rate of attrition in recent years amid a growing global demand for such professionals.\n\n“Naturally, with Singapore looking to add about 4,000 new nurses to the workforce by the year-end, many Indian nurses from the smaller cities and particularly the north-east are looking to come here,” said an Indian nurse who has been working here for 12 years.\n\n“Many of them face financial difficulties and can boost their household incomes by working here.”\n\nAccording to the Singapore Nursing Board (SNB), nurses from India constituted 1.3 per cent of the total workforce here in 2022. The majority were from the Philippines (13 per cent), followed by Malaysia (5.7 per cent), Myanmar (2.4 per cent) and China (1.27).\n\nMany nurses from India, like other foreigners, found the working conditions difficult during Covid-19 and returned home once borders reopened as the pandemic waned.\n\nTo make up for the shortfall after Covid-19, 5,600 nurses were hired in the public healthcare system in 2023, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Singapore is looking to add about 4,000 new nurses to the workforce by year-end, with two-thirds of them from overseas.\n\nNurses from India, even with experience, have to pass the SNB licence exam. They then have to secure a job in Singapore, get the board’s registration and apply for a work permit.\n\nIndian media reported that Japan and Australia are also wooing Indian nurses because they are considered among the best in the world.\n\nKerala has long been a global source for nurses. But these days, most nurses from the state prefer to go to the US, Europe or Australia. So, it is from the north-eastern states and places like Delhi that nurses are looking to work in Singapore.\n\n“Nurses from India know the basics but they also have to adapt to the Singapore culture, especially Singlish,” said a nurse from India who works at a private clinic at Mount Elizabeth. “In India, family members of the patient also help out at the hospital. But here they have to do everything on their own.\n\n“It can be tiring because the hours are long and we have to stand most of the time. The break is also short during an eight- or 11-hour shift. There is often a lack of manpower and the conditions can get tough.”\n\nScreaming patients and short-tempered relatives are other concerns, while job promotions aren’t as frequent and fast as they are in other professions.\n\n“It is sometimes difficult to deal with (difficult patients and their relatives) as they want everything in a hurry, but that’s not always possible,” said an Indian nurse who works at a local hospital.\n\n“Initially, some nurses get overwhelmed and stressed, but once they get the hang of it, they settle down and it becomes routine for them. Some cannot take it and want to leave, but they can’t because their contract is usually for two or five years.\n\n“It is very tiring physically and mentally, but for many, nursing isn’t just a profession but a passion. We get used to handling the difficulties over time.”\n\n“Nurses from India know the basics but they also have to adapt to the Singapore culture, especially Singlish.”\n\nA nurse from India who works at a private clinic at Mount Elizabeth", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/eda9db16719abb2e20df2170849e1b336a2bd8a8a22f5fe6131318a4f1b40bb2?w=825", "alt_text": "A Meghalaya government job fair for nurses in 2023, at which international recruiters were also present."}]}

These people just don’t believe they could have a problem.\n\nEven when they do, many – especially men – convince themselves their condition will improve on its own.\n\nDr Chong Yeh Woei, a senior physician in private practice and a former president of the Singapore Medical Association, attributes this to the “Masters of the Universe” syndrome.\n\nHe explained that this is because men are programmed by society to be “warriors with our body armour, our weapons to fight and compete in school, in sports, in love, and from careers to business.”\n\nSo it comes as a shock that there could be a hole in their body armour, be it a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes or coronary artery disease.\n\nDr Chong said: “I noticed that the more successful the man was, the harder such a crisis would be for him. Some successful career women have exhibited such a syndrome as well.”\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong in perceiving yourselves as strong and capable of handling everything, we should not see going to the doctor as a weakness.\n\nIn many instances, it could make us stronger.\n\nBy Khush Randhawa\n\nPhoto: EPA-EFE", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bedb31e9f096c558928c02d3f1f1959c012d02e0c04d800e7000f7733f8ce701?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Instead, he is the head physiotherapist at Charlton Athletic’s women’s football team, a position he has held since January, after studying and working in England for almost two years.\n\nThe 30-year-old’s interest in sports medicine arose after a spate of injuries while playing football in his youth, including fractures on both feet.\n\n“The injuries led to chronic ankle issues that flared up during national service – and it was a physio that got me through that,” he said.\n\n“At that point, I wasn’t very sure what the physio profession was about. But I loved the idea of being part of the recovery process and learning about various treatment methods.”\n\nAfter earning a degree in physiotherapy from Trinity College Dublin, Suren’s first professional involvement as a sports physio came in March 2021 when he joined the medical staff of S.League club Tampines Rovers. He spent a year and a half at the club before leaving for the University of Birmingham to pursue a master’s degree in exercise and sports medicine.\n\nLater, while converting his Singapore physio license to a UK one, Suren landed a job with a football team of the Pro Direct Academy in Birmingham – a countrywide franchise with football teams in various counties.\n\n“The story about how I got with them was actually crazy,” said Suren. “I was running around the Astro turf where they were training, doing my own bit of exercise, when I noticed one of their players was injured. Unfortunately, they did not have a physio.\n\n“After their training, I introduced myself to the coach and asked if the player needed any help. He told me he had been looking high and low for a physio – and there I was in front of him, offering my services. I started working for them that very week.”\n\nSuren spent a few months with the academy team while finishing his master’s and with an eye on his goal of working as a physio for a club in England – which according to him “is the best place in the world for football”.\n\nAfter a brief stint at Birmingham FC’s academy, Suren reached out to a contact who worked at Charlton Athletic, a club based in London, and joined the women’s first team as its head physio.\n\nAt Charlton, aside from providing pitch-side medical care during training and match days, Suren’s tasks include player assessments and treatments and working closely with management on player rehab.\n\n“Sports physiotherapy encompasses more than just injury treatment,” he said. “It involves injury prevention, performance enhancement and player education. It entails long hours, weekend shifts and high-pressure scenarios.”\n\nJuxtaposing the matchday experiences at Tampines and Charlton, Suren said the long away-game journeys were an eye-opener initially.\n\n“Travel-related fatigue can take a toll on the players. So we have to ensure they stay as fresh as possible prior to the match,” he said. “We often have to stay overnight for away games and some trips take about six hours via coach.\n\n“We also have relegation-promotion systems in the UK. The emotions are immense when you have that in play as your team’s success may determine if the club undergoes changes in budgets and your job security may be affected.\n\n“I have seen physios losing their jobs after a club is relegated, but also get pay raises and job promotions when the team performs well.”\n\n“Sports physiotherapy encompasses more than just injury treatment.

The project marks the Tamil star’s second directorial venture, following the 2017 film Pa Paandi.\n\nRecently, Dhanush and his son visited their ancestral temple in Tamil Nadu’s Theni district to pray for the success of Raayan, reported India Today.\n\nThe actor shared a photo on social media showing him sitting cross-legged on the ground while praying at the temple. The scene is serene, with a large tree adding to the peaceful ambience. He captioned it: “Staying connected to your roots is peace”, accompanied by a white heart emoji.\n\nDhanush right now needs all the peace in the world after he called himself an “outsider” at the audio launch of Raayan.\n\nHe claimed at the event that there were a lot of negative comments after he bought a house in Chennai’s Poes Garden, known for housing film celebrities Rajinikanth and the late Jayalalitha, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\n“If I knew buying a house in Poes Garden would have become such a big topic of conversation, I would have simply got a small apartment,” he said. “Should I not buy a house in Poes Garden? If I live on the street, should I stay there only?”\n\nWhile the story was inspirational about how hard work could get a person to the top, the Internet reminded Dhanush that he did not come from the streets as his father is director Kasthuri Raja.\n\nOne miffed user wrote on X: “Its funny when a Nepo Kid like #Dhanush is talking about starting from scratch. Like, damm your family has a cinema background and you access it easily with no talents at all during your first few movies. And you talk about being on the streets? Do you know what is streets?”\n\nAnother X user pointed out that Dhanush’s father financed his first film when he was just 18 and he was married to Rajinikanth’s daughter by the time he was 20 after achieving success.\n\n“What is this new level of idiocy from Dhanush?” the user wrote, adding: “Why do these actors act as if they are something out of the ordinary? Wearing a simple dress and a rudraksha doesn’t mean someone is simple and humble. The mindset is what matters.”\n\nOn the film front, Dhanush is praying for Raayan to be a hit. It is his landmark 50th film and also written and directed by him.\n\nThe trailer and promotional content have managed to create some buzz for the film. After Indian 2’s fiasco, the Tamil film industry is hoping Raayan serves as a saviour for distributors and exhibitors.\n\nThe film has the right formula for success. It is a revenge drama centred on the titular character, who undergoes rigorous training to avenge the murderers responsible for his family’s deaths. His quest leads him deep into the criminal underworld.\n\nRaayan features a stellar cast, including S.J. Suryah, Prakash Raj, Selvaraghavan, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar and Saravanan, among others.\n\nThe music is composed by A.R. Rahman, with cinematography by Om Prakash and editing by Prasanna GK.\n\nDuring the audio launch, Dhanush also revealed that Rahman agreed to do the film at a time when he was working on 30 other films.\n\n“When I called Rahman sir, I informed him that this was my 50th film and wished to see the tag “An AR Rahman Musical’ along with it,” said Dhanush.\n\n“He asked me to give him two days to respond. When he called back, Rahman sir told me he was working on as many as 30 films at that moment. ‘It’s a very tough yes, but I am giving you a yes,’ he said. ‘I will always cherish the memories of working with you’.”\n\nActor Suryah said he was impressed with Dhanush’s direction, explaining how the actor-director is heavily focused on everything inside a frame. He added that Dhanush handled the lighting, looks, sets and everything else, involving himself in every aspect of the process.\n\nDhanush is one of the most multi-talented personalities in Indian cinema, as he has proven his mettle in various areas of filmmaking including direction, singing and acting. So, all eyes are on him and if Raayan will click.\n\nTicket bookings commenced a few days ago, and the movie is showing terrific momentum in ticket sales. Raayan’s pre-sales surpassed the Rs2 crore ($321,000) mark in Tamil Nadu and is all set to open in double digits in the South.\n\nKarnan (2021) is so far the biggest opener for Dhanush with Rs10 crore gross in Tamil Nadu. But, looking at the advance ticket sales, Raayan is expected to go past Karnan’s opening day numbers by a good margin.\n\nIn the Telugu states, there isn’t much hype for the film, and the box office performance of the Telugu dubbed version depends entirely on word of mouth. Raayan is also releasing in Hindi simultaneously.\n\nAfter Indian 2’s fiasco, the Tamil film industry is hoping Raayan serves as a saviour for distributors and exhibitors.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a1624aff21ed50d30d96490daab812cead7501c6208e99a6f13b4d2005390458?w=825", "alt_text": "Actor Dhanush in Raayan."}]}

Suman flew in from Nepal to give a talk.\n\nOther interactive talks were helmed by Abu Jalal (Art Process and Completion), Vijaya Mohan (Therapeutic Aspect of Art) and Tokyo-born artist Kumiko Matsushima (Kintsugi Philosophy in Art).\n\nExperts also conducted workshops on Kerala murals, Lippan handicraft (a traditional fine art of Rajasthan and Gujarat’s desert regions) and one-stroke art (a decorative painting technique that involves shading, highlighting and blending in a single stroke movement).\n\n“We had around 1,200 visitors and several charity stalls that supported various causes,” said Ms Sonal.  “Our Young Artist Appreciation Programme was a success as it served to nurture creativity and a love for traditional arts in children.”\n\nOver the past seven years, Tista Art Gallery has organised more than 10 exhibitions in Singapore, showcasing both renowned and new artists.\n\nStrokeart has been an integral part of those exhibitions by providing artists, and as an art educator. For the last 24 years, the art school has been instrumental in fostering appreciation and awareness of traditional art forms through art classes, workshops and talks.\n\n“Looking ahead, Tista Art Gallery plans to continue curating and creating more exhibitions to support the artistic community,” said Ms Megha. “We will be hosting regular art workshops, informative talks and art jamming sessions to keep the creative momentum going.\n\n“Strokeart will focus on educating young artists by exploring different art forms, and aims to develop more collaborative exhibitions to further enrich the art scene.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5ee9918ee39a07e75b0d96f43a2c745994ee78bb70453d16ec407749f8bd778e?w=825", "alt_text": "Participants and organisers at the Origin of Art exhibition."}]}

Mandate local reservation and appoint government officer in every company to monitor. This will scare Indian IT and Global Capability Centres. Short sighted,” Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India co-chairman R.K. Mishra said.\n\nThe National Association of Software and Service Companies, which represents India’s US$200 billion ($268 billion) technology industry, sought the bill’s withdrawal, saying it “threatens to drive away companies”.\n\n“The restrictions could force companies to relocate as local skilled talent becomes scarce,” the top industry body said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/011e8af2c580d639bca160920a8eb9d34b5bfa6ad54fbd06542ff5ce51f7f546?w=825", "alt_text": "Chief Minister Siddaramaiah."}]}

Singapore will face Thailand, Malaysia and Brunei in the group phase.\n\nIf you didn’t know the brothers personally, you would have trouble telling them apart – both are lanky with similar mop-top haircuts.\n\nBut watching them play, the difference is clear enough. Tarunn is a centre-back who stands at 1.84m, while Taressh is a striker who’s a centimetre shorter. While both are adept at their roles, their playing styles are quite different.\n\n“We started playing football like most other kids under the block when we were about seven years old,” said Tarunn. “Our father had a Sunday league team as well, so we used to go down and watch them. Later we started playing for the team.”\n\nThe twins didn’t realise their potential until they were 11 years old, said Taressh.\n\n“We realised we were good at the sport when we were in Primary 5 and representing Jurong West Primary School. I was the top scorer that season and we emerged West Zone champions,” he said.\n\nThroughout their journey, the twins, who are both Arsenal supporters, have been inseparable.\n\nThey were both awarded scholarships to Queensway Secondary School after being scouted by the school’s coach.\n\nCurrently, they are pursuing their NITEC certification in the automotive work-study diploma programme at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) West.\n\nThey currently play for Tanjong Pagar’s Under-21 Centre of Excellence team.\n\nThough the brothers have always played together on the same team growing up, Tarunn made the Singapore U-19 team before Taressh, which left the former slightly disappointed.\n\n“I was called up to the team in early June for the first training camp, in preparation for the AFF Championship. Taressh joined the squad for the second training camp in Bangkok at the end of the month,” said Tarunn.\n\nTaressh said: “One of the strikers had to leave the squad due to National Service, so the coaches were looking for a replacement. Tarunn suggested my name and the coaches got my father to send them my highlight reels, and I eventually got picked.”\n\nWhile both aspire to play for Johor Darul Ta’zim FC in the Malaysian Super League – and of course, the Singapore senior team – for now, they are focused on completing their Higher NITEC and pursuing a diploma at a polytechnic.\n\n“We owe everything to our dad and coaches who have guided us to this point;  especially our dad who has been the biggest pillar for us – driving us to matches, telling us our mistakes on the pitch and helping us improve,” said Tarunn.\n\nTheir father Kannan Marimuthu, 49, said: “I could see that these boys since young were not the most interested in academics but more so in football. When I realised they had the skill and talent, I had to support them and push them to go as high as they can.”\n\n“I’m happy they themselves have come to understand that academics also matters. I am proud of their growth.”\n\nThe brothers also play for Tanjong Pagar U-21s in the centre of excellence league.\n\nPhoto: Kannan Marimuthu\n\n“The coaches were looking for a replacement striker.

Since then, he has sung more than 50 film songs in multiple languages.\n\nThe concert here marked the first time his show featured a standing pen for fans. Perhaps that was why Sid sang a more upbeat rendition for many of his songs, giving the show more of a rock-concert vibe. The band members also played solo numbers.\n\nSpeaking to the audience, Sid said the show was also the first time his sister was watching him live. He added that his parents were also at the show, which gave him “immense pride and happiness”.\n\nHaving grown up in California after being born in Chennai, Sid highlighted the importance of culture and recognising one’s roots. “We all need to find that connection and appreciate our culture,” he said.\n\nAudience member Niveditha Anbalagan, 18, said she really liked the show, despite expecting more slow songs.\n\n“The concert had me and my friends on our feet for almost three hours, and we didn’t realise the time went by so quickly,” added the Nanyang Technological University student.\n\n“My favourite part of the concert was when Sid sang “Thenpaandi Cheemaiyile” from the movie Nayagan. It’s the song my dad sang to put me to sleep when I was younger, and it brought back many memories.”\n\nFor Vishal Nathan, 19, Sid’s show marked his first concert experience.\n\n“It was amazing.

The ceremony happens once in 12 years after the temple undergoes redevelopment and restoration works.\n\nTamil Murasu\n\nலாவண்யா வீரராகவன்\n\nSome 6,000 Hindu devotees from across Singapore thronged the Sri Muneeswaran Temple in Commonwealth Drive on July 12 for a consecration ceremony that transformed the temple grounds into a vibrant sea of spirituality.\n\nThe Sri Muneeswaran Temple has a rich history dating back to 1932 when it started as a small shrine in Queenstown for Malayan railway workers.\n\nAfter relocating to Commonwealth Drive, the temple underwent several renovations through the years to expand its facilities for the growing congregation of Hindu devotees in the area. It also witnessed two consecration ceremonies.\n\nThe third ceremony on July 12 began at 4am with prayers and rituals. The “Gadappurappadu” (procession of priests carrying holy water pots on their heads), wound its way through the temple grounds led by 43 Shivacharyas – priests who chanted Vedic hymns.\n\nAs the ceremony reached its climax, the Shivacharyas performed the sacred consecration ritual at exactly 6.45am, their chants filling the air with an otherworldly energy.\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam, accompanied by his wife Jane Ittogi and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, graced the occasion as special guests, mingling with the devotees and partaking in the festivities.\n\nPosting on social media after the event, President Tharman said: “Even if you are not a Hindu, the story behind Sri Muneeswaran Temple in Commonwealth Drive is worth knowing.\n\n“Like some of our other places of worship, its roots go back to the ordinary folk, including the most humble workers, who came to our shores a century or more ago.\n\n“Regardless of our faiths, we should know and remember the unique social histories of our places of worship. They are part of our collective heritage as Singaporeans.”\n\nThe temple’s chairman, Mr Rathinam Selvarajoo, said the event was a “resounding success thanks to the dedication and hard work of the temple management, volunteers and support of the devotees”.\n\nThe organisers ensured a hassle-free worship during the ceremony, with the elderly and the disabled allowed to pray first. Seats were also arranged for the devotees and two large screens were erected outside the temple.\n\nThose in attendance were able to witness the newly painted temple tower, a new Muneeswaran 3D mural over the ceiling made of fibreglass, and newly renovated columns with “Thirukkurals” (sacred philosophies) inscribed on them.\n\nGoodie bags with a bottle of holy water and “kumkumam”, a powder used for religious markings on the forehead, were handed out to the devotees.\n\nMs Anbarasi, 58, and Ms Yuganeshwari, 29, were a mother-daughter duo who volunteered during the ceremony.\n\n“We needed to make sure that everyone received a goodie bag, and that the crowd didn’t gather at the wrong places,” said Ms Anbarasi.\n\n“Nothing makes us happier and gives us more peace than volunteering at a temple, especially for a ceremony like this one.”\n\nOne devotee, who only wanted to be known as Devaraj, said he believes that worshipping on this special day would fulfil his wishes.\n\n“I’ve witnessed two of the last three consecration ceremonies at this temple.

Vance on his wife Usha Chilukuri.\n\nGetty Images via AFP\n\nObservers believe United States presidential candidate Donald Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance, who has been a senator only since January 2023, is likely to face questions over both his lack of political experience and his transition from 2016 Trump critic to heir to the Make America Great Again movement.\n\nIf his 2022 Senate campaign is any indication, his wife Usha Chilukuri may play an understated but key role in helping introduce him to the public.\n\nMs Usha comes with a wealth of credentials and a deep connection to Indian values and culture.\n\nA litigator at a US firm, she is the daughter of Indian immigrants who have roots in Andhra Pradesh. The 38-year-old grew up in a suburb of San Diego.\n\nShe holds a bachelor’s degree in history from Yale University and a master of philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge, according to the New York Times. After college, she assisted two Supreme Court justices.\n\nIn 2015, she started as an associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, DC. She continued working at the firm between clerkships, where – according to her employee biography – she handled “complex civil litigation and appeals” in sectors that included “higher education, local government, entertainment and technology, including semiconductors”.\n\nThe firm announced on Monday that she had resigned.\n\nSpeaking to Newsmax during a 2022 interview about her husband, Ms Usha said: “Sometimes people say that he’s changed a lot, but the truth is I’ve known him now for so many years, and he’s always been so true to himself.”\n\nFor years, Mr Vance, 38, has described his wife as a key part of his success, dating back to when the two attended law school together at Yale. In his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, Mr Vance described her as his “Yale spirit guide,” helping him navigate life at the elite university where they met.\n\nThe pair married in an interfaith ceremony in Kentucky in 2014 – Ms Usha’s family is Hindu, while her husband converted to Catholicism in 2019. They have three children together: sons Ewan, 6, and Vivek, 4, and daughter Mirabel, 2.\n\nIn an interview earlier with Fox & Friends, Ms Usha and Mr Vance talked about the two having different faiths and their views on him becoming a pick for vice-president.\n\n“I don’t think people understand how hard he works and how creative he is. Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He’s always trying to do better,” said Ms Usha.\n\nOn being asked about the reason behind her support for Mr Vance, she said: “There are a few different reasons. One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents. And so I think I’ve seen that.. the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.”\n\nThe interview was done three weeks before the announcement of Mr Vance as Mr Trump’s running mate.\n\nThe Ohio Senator has consistently acknowledged his wife’s role in supporting his career.\n\n“I’m one of those guys who really benefits from having sort of a powerful female voice over his left shoulder saying, ‘Don’t do that, do that,’” he said during his 2020 appearance on The Megyn Kelly Show. “Usha definitely brings me back to earth. If I get a little too cocky or a little too proud, I just remind myself that she’s way more accomplished than I.”\n\nWell-known entrepreneur and a friend of the Trump family AI Mason told ANI:  “Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants – and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket.\n\n“She knows the Indian culture and all about India. She can be a big help to her husband in navigating great ties between USA and India.”\n\nPhoto: REUTERS\n\n“Usha definitely brings me back to earth.

While the tops do vary, and often embrace modernity, many choose to dress modestly when attending a Hindu ceremony.\n\nFor Saturday’s wedding celebrations, the Skims founder switched things up with a stunning pale pink and silver lehenga paired with a sheer long-sleeved choli and a matching dupatta.\n\nAnd on Sunday, the mom of four rocked another red look, wearing a Gaurav Gupta creation featuring a wrapped red fabric top and matching skirt along with a striking red veil.\n\nPosting to Instagram on Sunday, Kim shared a carousel of images with the caption: “India has my love”. Dripping in diamonds, she looked nothing short of dazzling.\n\nShe was dripping in hundreds of carats of Lorraine Schwartz jewels at each event, including diamonds, emeralds and a show-stopping piece that featured a massive 70-carat diamond chain stretching from her ear to a nose ring.\n\n“Not supposed to wear red to a wedding in India. That’s saved for the bride,” one fan commented on her post, while another added: “Isn’t wearing red at a Hindu/Indian wedding equivalent to wearing white to a civil/Christian wedding?”\n\n“I’m Mexican and even I know you’re NOT supposed to wear Red to an Indian wedding,” a third Instagram user commented.\n\nHowever, it seems the Ambanis didn’t mind; Kim was spotted sharing warm interactions with the bride and groom along with his mother and sister.\n\nAmbani and Merchant tied the knot in a grand celebration that spoke volumes of their deep-rooted connection, having transformed their childhood friendship into a loving partnership over the years.\n\nAfter their public debut as a couple in 2018 – following graduations from Brown (Anant) and New York Universities (Radhika) – their relationship has been one that’s been the admiration of many.\n\nThe main wedding ceremony began on July 12 and brought together a handful of high-profile guests, including famous celebrities, politicians and influential business people such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.\n\n“Isn’t wearing red at a Hindu/ Indian wedding equivalent to wearing white to a civil/ Christian wedding?”\n\nA comment on Instagram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/eb4fdec4eb0d29c11cd2afd70926c0b1619969aa46e0312b5f4695841e2d3a3b?w=825", "alt_text": "Kim Kardashian in one of the two red dresses she wore to the multi-day affair."}]}

Despite giving it my all, I couldn’t achieve much,” he recently said on the show The Dreamers on JioCinema.\n\n“I started doubting if all the hard work was worth it. I called my father, who encouraged me to participate in the next competition in Sri Lanka.”\n\nJena won in Lebanon with a throw of 78.96m, which by any standard was a modest performance.\n\nHis first 80m-plus throw didn’t come until March 2023, during the Indian Grand Prix in Thiruvananthapuram where he produced an 81.05m effort.\n\n“I decided the event in Sri Lanka would be my last attempt, after which I would quit and go back to prioritising work and family. With God’s grace, I performed well, producing a throw of 84.38m which led to my qualification for the World Championships,” he said.\n\nJena qualified for the Budapest World Championships in August 2023 through world ranking quota. He could not breach the automatic qualification mark of 85.2m.\n\n“I performed well in the World Championships, achieving a personal best of 84.77m,” said the Odisha native who finished fifth in the final while Chopra won the gold with 88.17m.\n\n“I followed it up with another personal best of 87.54m at the Asian Games (in Hangzhou, China, where he won a silver behind Chopra) securing my ticket to Paris 2024.\n\n“I now want to give my best at the Paris Olympics.

Mr Ravindran Nair is now in hospital, being treated for dehydration and back pain, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\nThe Thiruvananthapuram resident told local media that when he stepped into Lift 11 – meant for patients and visitors – to head up to the second floor of the hospital, there was no one else in the lift.  “But the light was on, so I didn’t think anything was wrong,” he said.\n\nHe pressed the button and the lift began ascending but, as it neared the second floor, it lurched downwards with a thud and got stuck between the first and second floors.\n\nWhen he got trapped, Mr Nair tried calling the emergency number listed in the lift but there was no response. He also tried calling his wife Sreelekha, who works at the hospital, and “anyone else I could think of”, but the calls wouldn’t connect.\n\n“I began panicking and started banging on the lift doors to attract attention,” he told the BBC. “That’s when my phone fell on the floor and stopped working.\n\n“I shouted and screamed for help and tried pulling apart the doors with my hands. It was now dark inside the lift, but thankfully, there was sufficient air to breathe.”\n\nHe then paced around the lift, pressing the alarm bell again and again, hoping it would ring and catch someone’s attention – but with no success.\n\n“As the hours passed, I had no idea whether it was day or night as it was pitch dark inside. When I got tired, I slept in a corner. I had to use another corner to pee and poo,” he said.\n\nAt some point, he remembered he had to take pills to keep his blood pressure under control.\n\n“I had them on me, but couldn’t swallow them because I had no water and my mouth was dry from shouting for help,” he recalled.\n\n“I started wondering whether I would die inside the lift. I worried about my wife and children and thought about my late parents and ancestors. But then, I somehow willed myself to be stronger and told myself that I had to overcome this frightening ordeal.”\n\nOne thing that gave him comfort, he said, was reciting poems written by his wife. “I held on to the hope that someone would come along to repair the lift and find me there.”\n\nHelp finally arrived on Monday at around 6am when an operator opened the door – 42 hours after his ordeal began. Once Mr Nair was rescued, the first thing he did was call his wife, reported NDTV.\n\nHis family members initially thought he was at work, but later contacted the police and began a desperate search for him.\n\nMr Nair’s son Hari Shankar said his father was pretty shaken as he had been inside the lift for almost two days.\n\nThe incident made headlines in the state, prompting the health department to suspend two lift operators and a duty sergeant.\n\nOfficials from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and the state’s health minister have apologised to Mr Nair.\n\n“I had no idea whether it was day or night as it was pitch dark inside.

The city-state’s towering and intricately designed landscape was one of the reasons I moved here for work.”\n\nMr Tamil, who hails from Vedaranyam in Tamil Nadu and has a degree in architecture from Kanchipuram, said he never delved into sketching political figures before this effort.\n\nHe recalled the hard work – almost 52 hours – that he invested into the artwork across several weeks.\n\n“Every time, even after hours of detailed work, only a small portion of the portrait would be complete,” he said, adding that the finished product comprises an estimated 100,000 letters.\n\n“But during all those moments, I visualised how the final portrait of the leader would appear, imagining that in my heart and keeping that final product in my mind.\n\n“I used an ordinary pen with black ink as a paint brush stick. My objective was to not make a mistake; I wanted to be careful to ensure the accuracy of the final result.”\n\nMr Tamil, who also sketched Singapore’s skyline across his office wall, said he has been fascinated by landmarks and unique architectural styles since his youth.\n\nAs a teenager, he developed his passion for painting and explored various art forms such as wooden handicrafts, graphite arts, ‘pop up’ cards, and paper quilling.\n\nAs a student, he once created a painting of Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar using handwritten Thirukkurals – a classic Tamil language text consisting of 1,330 short couplets.\n\n“For my piece on Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I thought it was fitting to use the word “Singapore” – to symbolise the man’s lifelong dedication to the nation,” he explained.\n\nMr Max Shi, managing director of Modular Technology, praised his employee for his endeavour.\n\n“He exemplifies dedication and talent, contributing immensely to our company’s success. His artistic portrayal of Mr Lee Kuan Yew speaks volumes about his exceptional skill and creativity,” Mr Shi said.\n\nMr Tamilarasan Shanmuganandam receiving his award from Mr Ong Eng Huat, adjudicator from the Singapore Book of Records.\n\nPhoto: Tamilarasan Shanmuganandam\n\n“As I learnt more about his (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) significant role in shaping Singapore’s development and infrastructure, I felt compelled to honour the founding father in a meaningful way.”\n\nMr Tamilarasan Shanmuganandam", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/942cdfacbae89fa72ffad69591adfd343f55f1644a24d58ea4cc2de6c66ab13d?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Tamilarasan Shanmuganandam with his artwork of Singapore’s founding prime minister."}]}

His “goal”, he said, was to simply be in Germany for the occasion.\n\nAs highlighted by The Guardian, Spain’s and Yamal’s triumph is not just for his own prodigious talent but for the system that “produces him, nurtures him, throws him into a major championship semi-final and trusts him to thrash in a 25-metre thunderbolt”.\n\nThe wonder goal aside, Yamal has racked up four goal involvements in the campaign, making a strong case for being named Player of the Tournament if Spain are to win Euro 2024.\n\nIt’s difficult to comprehend how someone so young could possess the confidence and self-belief to carry himself so eloquently alongside and against the best players in the world – let alone produce the match winner on the biggest stage.\n\nHis surname is Nasaraoui Ebana and not Yamal, which is actually his middle name. With a Moroccan father and a mother from Equatorial Guinea, Yamal was born in Esplugues in Spain. Crucially, he now resides in Sant Joan Despí, at the famed La Masia football academy of FC Barcelona – Yamal’s club.\n\nNaturally, the comparisons with former Barca legend Lionel Messi were inevitable as soon as scouts and coaches caught the youngster in his debut for the Catalan club in April 2023.\n\nPhotos of Messi and Yamal, taken in 2007, drew attention after it was posted on Instagram by Yamal’s father last week, with one of them captioned: “The beginning of two legends.”\n\nThe photos were taken during a photoshoot in the visitors’ locker room at Barcelona’s Camp Nou in the autumn of that year.\n\nPhotographer Joan Monfort, who was in charge of the shoot, said Barcelona’s players at the time posed with children and their families for a calendar as part of an annual charity drive by local newspaper Diario Sport and UNICEF.\n\nAs serendipity would have it, Yamal was paired with a then 20-year-old Messi that day.\n\nRecently, just after England ousted the Dutch in their semi-final on Thursday morning, comparisons have been drawn of Yamal with England’s own 19-year-old prodigy, Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nMainoo has had a solid campaign at the base of England’s midfield, carrying on from his terrific season with Manchester United. So the juxtaposition is justifiable, even if he doesn’t fill the statsheet the same way Yamal does.\n\nEngland, who will face Spain in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday will be – nay, must be – wary of the braces-wearing Spanish golden boy.\n\nAn intriguing battle of the teenagers awaits us.\n\nIt’s difficult to comprehend how someone so young could possess the confidence and self-belief to carry himself so eloquently alongside and against the best players in the world – let alone produce the match winner on the biggest stage.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2055f23fb1ad24304b7addfc9f84a5f4cc1b62b42cfa8ab2be2e522ea138d8c6?w=825", "alt_text": "Lamine Yamal of Spain"}]}

The male caller asked him if he had lost his Aadhar card (a 12-digit unique identity number given to all residents of India based on their biometrics and demographic data).\n\n“He then informed me that someone had opened an account in Mumbai using it and a money laundering case of crores had taken place through it and a case had been registered in a Mumbai police station,” said Mr Saxena.\n\n“Then he introduced himself as CBI Inspector Rohan Sharma and said an arrest warrant had been issued against me. But, as I was an elderly person and seemed to be a good man, he would try to get me released if I cooperated. Otherwise, I might face a long jail term.”\n\nThe man then checked the writer’s Aadhar card and asked questions related to the number of bank accounts he had, the amount of money in them, the number of transactions, investments, income and income tax returns.\n\n“I was able to see the man’s police uniform and a cap, which convinced me,” Mr Saxena said.\n\n“As soon as he saw my room full of books, to ensure that I was the right person and the same poet he had called, he asked me to prove myself by reciting poetry. He asked me to recite the couplets of Mirza Ghalib and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. He even asked me to recite my own poems, which I did. He listened to my poems for a long time and even praised me a lot,” the writer said.\n\nHe added that all this went on for six hours.\n\nThe conman then told Mr Saxena that the CBI chief of Mumbai would talk to him.\n\nTo convince Mr Saxena further, he told the “chief” (a member of his gang) that Mr Saxena was a good man and should be investigated on priority.\n\n“The ‘chief’ said that since I was cooperating in the investigation, he would get me released within 24 hours and told me that I was currently under house arrest,” said Mr Saxena.\n\nThe men then told him to close his room door and not inform his family members of what was happening. But when Mr Saxena did not open his door for a long time, his family members became alarmed.\n\nWhen his daughter-in-law went into the room, she sensed he was being tricked through a cyber fraud. She snatched the mobile phone and disconnected the call.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh police are currently tracking down the criminals.\n\nThe police said “digital house’ arrest” is the latest scam tactic used by criminal gangs in India. It refers to the virtual restraint of individuals, a tactic cybercriminals use to trap victims in their homes and defraud them.\n\nThe scammers use AI-generated voice or video calls to impersonate law enforcement officials, creating fear by falsely accusing victims of wrongdoing, generally related to their Aadhaar or phone number.\n\nThey demand money in exchange for closing the case, often threatening the victim with arrest if they don’t comply.

But in the vicinity of Bukit Timah – an area well known for million-dollar bungalows and upscale European restaurants – sits a well-known South Indian restaurant minutes away from Bukit Panjang MRT station.\n\nLocated at 808/810 Upper Bukit Timah Road, Karu’s Banana Leaf Restaurant has been around for 31 years, though not always at its current location.\n\nOver the past decade, the brand has moved its main outlet back and forth, as well as opened and closed a second outlet because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2016, the eatery shifted to the now-closed Sime Darby Centre in Dunearn Road, but made the unusual move back to its initial locale just three years later, following issues with the landlord.\n\nIn April, Karu’s opened a new branch at HomeTeamNS Bukit Batok, a recreation centre dedicated to police and civil defence personnel – though it is also open to the public.\n\nRestaurant owner Subramanyam Nallappan, 58, said he started the first Karu’s restaurant in 1993 along with his brothers.\n\n“They were chefs, and I was interested in cooking, so we always wanted to open a restaurant together,” he said.\n\n“Little India was the obvious choice for the location, but we felt the restaurant pool there was already saturated. We realised the Bukit Timah and Bukit Panjang areas lacked Indian restaurants, leading us to opening Karu’s there.”\n\nOver the years, Karu’s has become known for its signature South Indian dishes such as masala chicken and Mysore mutton, as well as its free flow of rice.\n\nA standard set meal – with an unlimited choice of biryani or white rice, two vegetables, a meat dish and pappadums – costs around $13.50.\n\nThe new branch in Bukit Batok, equipped with a bigger kitchen, offers more options, including North Indian dishes such as butter chicken and gobi Manchurian. Garlic naan and butter chicken cost $4 and $14.50 respectively.\n\nIn 2016, Karu’s shifted to the Sime Darby Centre due to a lack of kitchen space. It then moved back to the initial location after issues with the new landlord who took over midway into the tenure.\n\nDetermined to branch out, Mr Subramanyam opened a new branch at Turf City – also in Bukit Timah – in 2020. But it almost immediately faced challenges borne from the Covid-19 pandemic, and had to draw its shutters permanently in 2022.\n\nAround that time, Karu’s main outlet faced a customer-parking issue when the car park behind the eatery had to make way for a new condominium.\n\nThe restaurant and its diners face no such issue at the HomeTeamNS outlet, said Mr Subramanyam.\n\n“At HomeTeamNS, there’s a huge car park where our customers can easily park their cars. There’s a FairPrice just down the lane, so there’s good human traffic here as well. We get a healthy number of customers every day,” he said.\n\nThe new outlet has seen a healthy mix of Indian and non-Indian customers since its opening, said the owner, who attributes Karu’s popularity over the years to consistent recipes.\n\n“We have never allowed for a compromise on our quality. We also provide generous portions. I believe this has led us to our success,” he said.\n\n“For now, we don’t have plans to open more outlets. I believe in having two good shops rather than four to five substandard ones.”\n\nNA\n\nTamil Murasu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3c67874858813bd5b350cb1dc68ccbbde9860429b2b336b0900294e9452eec97?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The accused’s influential family in the Pune case allegedly tried to tamper with evidence and mislead the police.\n\nMumbai police formed 11 teams and deployed the Crime Branch to arrest Mihir. Police said that, after the accident, Mihir and Rajrishi took the BMW to Bandra and abandoned it. Mihir then took another car and sped towards Borivali in the northern tip of the city.\n\n“He went to the house of his female friend and then went untraceable. He switched off his mobile phone in Borivali,” a police officer said.\n\nPolice later found out that Mihir called his father and told him about the accident. Rajesh asked his son to leave the city and said Rajrishi would take the blame for the incident.\n\nMihir then called his girlfriend and reached her home in Goregaon in an autorickshaw. The accused then slept at his girlfriend’s home for two hours after telling her about the accident and the death of the woman. She then called his elder sister Pooja, who is also her business partner.\n\nPooja went to the Goregaon home and took Mihir back to their Borivali residence, reported India Today, quoting a police source.\n\nFrom there, Mihir, Pooja, younger sister Kinjal, mother Meena and a friend Avdeep left in two cars for Yeoor Hills Resort in Thane West. After some hours, they left for another resort in Murbad.\n\nOn Monday evening, Mihir and his friend Avdeep left for a resort in Virar.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Avdeep, who was also on the radar of the police, switched on his mobile phone for 15 minutes. This helped police track him, and ultimately Mihir, at the resort in Virar.\n\nAn officer told the court that Mihir shaved his beard and cut his hair to evade arrest.\n\nInvestigators said Mihir partied with four friends in a bar in Juhu till the early hours of Sunday, after which he and his driver travelled towards south Mumbai. The police have found the bar bill of Rs18,000 ($290).\n\nSources told NDTV that Mihir admitted to the police that he was driving the luxury car when it hit the couple on the bike. But he claimed that he wasn’t drunk.\n\nHis father Rajesh reportedly went to the accident site at 6.45am on Sunday, a little over an hour after the hit-and-run took place.\n\nThe dead women’s husband, who was riding the bike, complained to police that Rajesh was trying to destroy evidence.\n\nThe politician has been charged for allegedly giving misinformation and destroying evidence, police said. He was later suspended by the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction).\n\nThe victim’s family have raised apprehensions that traces of alcohol would not appear in Mihir’s blood because of the delay in arrest.\n\n“He was arrested after three days, what does this mean? If he wasn’t drunk, if he hadn’t taken drugs, then why did he go into hiding?” the victim’s husband Pradeep said.\n\n“You abandoned the vehicle on the way and broke the number plate before running away. After three days, there won’t be any traces of alcohol in his body, and he will have 20 lawyers with him.”\n\nMaharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde said no one would be spared in the case.\n\n“No one, whether rich, influential or the offspring of bureaucrats or ministers, affiliated with any party, will have immunity as long as I am the chief minister,” he said.\n\nThe BMW allegedly driven by Mihir Shah (pictured) in an accident that killed a woman in Mumbai on Sunday.\n\nPhotos: PTI\n\n“He was arrested after three days, what does this mean?

Mum wanted to make roast but I had other ideas… Dosa and sambar,” Ms Kumaran wrote on X.\n\nLast Friday, she became the first MP for Stratford and Bow, a constituency in East London, and the first Tamil woman elected to the British Parliament.\n\nThe 36-year-old secured 19,145 votes in the parliamentary elections and pushed the Conservative Party candidate (3,144 votes) to fourth position.\n\nLauding her achievement, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on X: “You bring great pride to the Tamil community.”\n\nMs Kumaran’s family migrated to England in the 1980s to escape the brutal civil war in Sri Lanka that killed thousands of Tamils.\n\nLast week, she spoke about her experience getting into politics, her Tamil roots and her parents.\n\n“Britain offered them a safe refuge,” she told the Tamil Guardian. “Tamils fleeing the (civil war) and violence were given amnesty in the UK and Canada. It was a Labour MP who took up my parents’ casework and helped them with their immigration status in the 80s.”\n\nHer parents, originally from Jaffna in Sri Lanka, have strong links to trade unionism and public service, influencing her strong Labour values.\n\nBorn and raised in London, Ms Kumaran’s political journey includes working for health service professionals, as a parliamentary researcher and caseworker for Labour MP Dawn Butler, and serving as deputy director of Parliamentary Affairs for Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nMs Kumaran said of her election: “It is the honour of my life to be elected to serve as the first ever Member of Parliament (MP) for Stratford and Bow. Thank you to all who placed your trust in me and in the Labour Party. I’ll always be your voice and your representative.”\n\nReflecting on her heritage and family’s influence, she said: “My grandad was one of Jaffna’s first trade unionists. Both my grandfathers were civil servants and always had a sense of public service. This runs throughout my family.”\n\nA record 28 Indian-origin politicians were elected to the House of Commons last week as the Labour Party made a come back to power after 14 years.\n\nThe lengthy list includes some prominent Conservatives, including former prime minister Rishi Sunak who survived an overall brutal outcome for the Tory party as well as several new faces.\n\nKerala-born Sojan Joseph became the first Labour candidate to win the Ashford constituency in its 139-year history.\n\nCelebrations broke out in Kerala as the poll was called in favour of the nurse who has resided in the UK since 2002, reported The Mint.\n\nMr Sojan is originally from Kaipuzha, a small village in Kottayam district, and currently serves as a mental health nurse with the Kent National Health Service.\n\nLabour party veterans Seema Malhotra (Feltham and Heston) and Lisa Nandy (Wigan) retained their seats, while Goan-origin Valerie Vaz won the newly formed Walsall and Bloxwich constituency.\n\nFirst-time Labour party MPs include Jas Athwal (Ilford South), Baggy Shanker (Derby South), Satvir Kaur (Southampton Test), Harpreet Uppal (Huddersfield), Warinder Juss (Wolverhampton West), Gurinder Josan (Smethwick), Kanishka Narayan (Vale of Glamorgan), Sonia Kumar (Dudley), Sureena Brackenbridge (Wolverhampton North East), Kirith Entwistle (Bolton North East) and Jeevun Sandher (Loughborough).\n\nMr Starmer will oversee a Parliament more ethnically diverse and more female than ever. Black, Asian and ethnic minority lawmakers will represent around 13 per cent of the House of Commons, up from 10 per cent in 2019, when Britain last held a parliamentary election.\n\nIt is the largest share of ethnic minority members in the lower house, according to British Future, a think tank.\n\nIn the 44 years since outgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was born, minority representation in Britain’s Parliament increased from zero to nearly one in seven lawmakers, British Future said.\n\nThe new parliament will also include a record 242 female lawmakers.\n\nMs Uma Kumaran.\n\nPhoto: @Uma_Kumaran/X\n\n“Britain offered (my parents) a safe refuge...

So I missed seeing a young samsui woman, like the one depicted in the Chinatown mural, by about three decades.\n\nDressed in their traditional dark-blue samfu — also spelt samfoo — with a distinctive red headdress, the elderly samsui women I saw hauled bricks and building materials in rattan scoops.\n\nThey were wary of strangers and, to save money, prepared their meals and ate among themselves. Many of these women were also celibate.\n\nTheir contribution to Singapore’s development was recognised in the Samsui Women television drama series produced in 1986 as well as in a play titled Samsui Women: One Brick At A Time, performed in 2015 at the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay.\n\nThen, during the 2018 National Day Parade, a short film highlighted the real-life story of a former samsui woman.\n\nOver time, they receded quietly into the annals of history until the mural of the young samsui woman with a cigarette appeared.\n\nA heated debate ensued when Mr Sean Dunston, a Singapore-based American artist who painted the mural, revealed a directive by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to remove the cigarette.\n\nURA had even cited a comment from a member of the public who said the woman “looks more like a prostitute than a hard-working samsui woman”.\n\nTo be fair to URA, there are long-established rules against public displays promoting or glamorising smoking. What’s more: no one applied for approval before commissioning the mural.\n\nDespite all that, there were, on the flip side, accusations of blatant censorship of creativity and artistic expression.\n\nIf historical accuracy is the issue, one observer noted that the woman should be smoking an “ang hoon”, which refers to the cheaper self-rolled cigarettes. Other critics took issue with her smooth elegant hands and asked why they were not calloused. For others, she could be doing any number of things a samsui woman would do when resting – besides smoking.\n\nHowever, there are artists who believe that art should create controversy.\n\nOn July 10, the URA and the Ministry of Health decided that the mural can stay, but have imposed a fine of $2,000 on the building owner for not obtaining approval.\n\nHowever, the authorities will work with the building owner to mitigate any impact that the mural may have in promoting smoking, without modifying the mural itself.\n\nThat should clear the air.\n\nBy Khush Randhawa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c7c44ebb14a78c502a2a5c949355e093a3a7068d215ad9320657cfb5454d6816?w=825", "alt_text": "American artist Sean Dunston’s mural of a young samsui woman with a cigarette on the exterior of 297 South Bridge Road, 21 June 2024."}]}

It officially opened in 1924, two years after the purchase of the land where it currently stands at Jalan Bukit Merah.\n\nIt was the first gurdwara in Singapore whose architecture included a traditional Sikh dome.\n\nDuring World War II, SRST housed the widows and families of Sikh soldiers killed in action. After the war, while some of these families returned to India, the temple continued to provide accommodation to Sikhs in transit from India to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and to the newly migrated local Sikhs – a role it played until the 1990s.\n\nToday, the temple continues to provide religious activities to the devotees and runs a significant community kitchen that operates seven days a week. It was particularly active during the Covid-19 lockdowns, serving thousands of meals a day to people of all races.\n\n“Over the years, the temple has been instrumental in fostering understanding of the Sikh community and its traditions, promoting interfaith harmony and serving as a conduit between the Sikh community and the wider Singapore community, thereby making an indelible contribution to inter-religious harmony and nation-building,” said Mr Gurdip Singh Usma, president of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board.\n\nThe event, which also comprised a bhangra performance before the mural unveiling, was attended by some 200 people, including Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh.\n\nMs Indranee lauded the temple’s dedication to serving society, emphasising its role as a symbol of Singapore’s harmonious blend of different races and religions.\n\n“The fact that the temple has been here for (100 years) and still serving the community and having people of all races coming to visit is testimony to Singapore’s cultural, religious and multiracial diversity,” Ms Indranee said.\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam, flanked by his wife Jane Ittogi, at the centennial celebration of the Silat Road Sikh Temple on July 6.

The goal is often to escape from the site of the game.\n\n“The idea came from a time in 2019 when three friends and I entered an escape room in Bugis and one of the room doors wouldn’t open even after we completed the puzzle,” explained Rishi, founder of Shuffle Studios, a local multimedia and production house.\n\n“We had to page in for a clue and that’s when the staff realised the door had malfunctioned. Later, the idea for an escape-room themed movie struck me.”\n\nThe 27-year-old, along with his three friends, took on the project a few months later.\n\nAfter an intense and hectic 30 days of shooting, averaging 16 hours daily, filming wrapped up in 2020. But the Covid-19 pandemic halted post-production and release plans.\n\n“We didn’t want to release the film without full theatre occupancy, so we held onto it,” Rishi said.\n\n“I felt that local films hadn’t explored the mystery-horror trope all that much, and that’s what I wanted to do.”\n\nCo-writer and actor Keerthana Kumaresan, 25, said the pandemic and the ensuing delay in production forced the script to adapt to modern advancements, including artificial intelligence.\n\n“The challenge was to ensure that whatever was added to the script had a proper flow,” she said.\n\nDespite being set in Singapore, Vidai was an international effort, with a diverse cast and crew from Singapore, Malaysia, India, UK and Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is Shuffle Studios’ second film, and Rishi, who has been running the studio for eight years, emphasised the importance of local support.\n\n“There’s a stigma about locally produced films. If one film doesn’t work, we’re dismissed as a collective,” he said. “We need people to give us a chance and watch our craft because there aren’t many of us producing films – and when we do, we need the support.”\n\nAudience member Rennuka Naranisamy, 29, a self-professed horror-movie buff, said she found the film a bit slow at first, but was captivated as it went on.\n\n“It became riveting towards the end with a plot twist. It explored a psychological concept not widely known or spoken about,” she said.\n\n“The acting and dialogues were engaging, and the film shows what can be achieved by young Indian talent in the local movie scene. It was very well done.”\n\nVarman said there may not be any full-fledged theatrical runs of the movie, but his team is in discussions with streaming platforms.\n\nHe added: “We plan to have premieres in Malaysia, India and England since the actors who worked on this project are from there.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0f2ad4a86e7a84598f066b7a398191872e87d8b1ad5cc94afa1f1ec0c2892f47?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

He had booked a room in a guest house for $10 a night.\n\nVaranasi, also known as Kashi, is one of the oldest cities in India. It is situated on the banks of the Ganges, which is sacred to the Hindus.\n\nThe city’s main draw is its death rituals. After a person dies, the body is wrapped – usually in white – and adorned with marigolds. It is then taken to the “ghats”, wide stone landings separated by steps that lead down to the Ganges, and burnt in wood-stacked pyres. The ashes are scattered in the river.\n\n“I spent Dec 31 at two ghats,” said Mr Yapp. “Not many people would like it as the atmosphere is eerie. But you cannot not feel spiritual, whatever faith you follow. I got a clear perspective on life and death and the human connections. You find that everything is real in Varanasi.”\n\nMr Yapp also attended the early morning arathi (prayers and puja) on Jan 4 and took a dip in the Ganges.\n\n“It was ice-cold,” he said. “But it was a special way of celebrating my birthday with tourists, families, the elderly and children cheering me on as they watched me. I felt privileged that I was in such a setting.”\n\nLater that morning, Mr Yapp had another birthday celebration, with Varanasi’s street kids. “I cut the fruit cake, my favourite, at a local church with the slum community around me,” he said. “It was a fantastic experience to be with people who did not have much.”\n\nHe also went to an Indian barber on the banks of the Ganges and got an oil-body and face massage done.\n\n“I paid just $2, it was a massage to die for. People say Varanasi is dirty. But I lay on the floor and got the massage done.”\n\nDuring his eight days in Varanasi, Mr Yapp “walked all the 88 ghats” and got to relish the “simple Indian food” it offered – different types of chaat, masala chai, mango lassi and Chinese-Indian cuisine.\n\n“Chinese-Indian combines spicy flavours with ingredients like soy sauce, szechuan (spicy red sauce), manchurian (sweet and salty brown sauce) and vinegar and are supremely tasty,” he said. “I got to taste chicken lollipop, chicken, shrimp and vegetable noodles popularly referred to as chow mein, chop suey and sweet and sour dishes.\n\n“Most of the food in Varansai caters to the needs of travellers and pilgrims. I also found a shop near the river which made the most amazing vegetable pizza. I had it for supper.”\n\nVaranasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency, is also the spiritual home of India’s sadhus, or holy men who have renounced the worldly life. They are revered by Hindus as representatives of the Gods and sometimes worshiped as Gods themselves.\n\n“I met a sadhu, who was smeared in ashes and had unkempt hair,” said Mr Yapp. “He said he was from Kolkata. I spoke to him in Bengali, and he was surprised. I told him that I learnt the language while being posted as Singapore Airlines’ station manager in Dhaka. He hugged me and blessed me.\n\n“Sadhus are friendly. They give hope to many people.”\n\nMr Yapp also found that the Mother Teresa Charity Home gives hope to many poor people in Varanasi.\n\n“I bathed the poor and gave them food. I also became friends with a deformed boy and took care of him for two days. I found it very meaningful to spend time with them.”\n\nMr Yapp, who was also Singapore Airlines’ station manager in San Francisco and now runs the Intan Peranakan museum at Joo Chiat Terrace post-retirement, pointed out that “ for many Singaporeans, India is not a popular holiday spot.\n\n“But for me it was wonderful. There is so much spirituality, homeliness and freshness about the country,” he said. “India has many things to offer. But Varanasi remains my favourite.”\n\n“My fascination for India has come full circle. A lot of Indians now visit my museum, and they have included TV and theatre personality Cyrus Broacha and a chef who opened a Peranakan restaurant in Mumbai. I am truly blessed.’\n\nMr Alvin Yapp with the sadhu he befriended.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Alvin Yapp\n\n“I got a clear perspective on life and death and the human connections.

She closes shop at 4pm – a process which takes up to two hours – before she returns home to rest her feet.\n\nThroughout it all, Madam Uma is not hard to spot at the busy wet market in Tekka. Though there are a number of Indian women manning vegetable stalls and what not, at the meat, poultry and seafood sections, she stands out as a rarity.\n\n“This job requires both physical and mental strength,” Madam Uma told tabla!  “It might not be an attractive career option for most women due to the stench and difficulties, but to me, it does not matter because if I forgo this business, there’s no one else to take over”.\n\nBack when she first started her trade, it took almost a year to master the grind.\n\n“It took me a long time to pick up the skill of cleaning and slicing the fish. I faced many customer complaints about it at the start, but over time things got better,” she said.\n\n“I’ve had cuts on my fingers; they have swelled up and there’s been irritation, but this is all part of the job, isn’t it?” the mother of two added.\n\nMadam Uma shared that she and her ex-husband initially wanted to open a food stall when they planned to run a business together 21 years ago. But due to high rental costs, they opted for a fishmonger stall instead.\n\nAfter their divorce, her oldest daughter, 29, began helping out at the stall. She has been doing so for the past decade.\n\n“While nobody in this day and age shows interest in working in this sector, I am happy she has been a pillar of support for me. She can even cut and clean a shark,” Madam Uma said.\n\nBusiness in recent years has been saliently affected by the pandemic and changing trends. “These days, not many people cook at home. They tend to eat out or order in, and everything has been digitalised,” Madam Uma said.\n\nAside from those concerns, she also has to deal with her daughter leaving the stall to pursue her education.\n\n“I am really uncertain about the future of the stall, but I will continue running it as long as I can.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e9194c3fbb9d7567c65e5cb79190043a269dbe5053446a5edcd020261a3a0716?w=825", "alt_text": "Madam Harikrishnan Uma works as a fishmonger at Tekka market."}]}

Chennai-resident Viswanathan Anand, the 15th world champion, previously lost the world title to Sweden’s Magnus Carlsen in their match in Chennai in 2013.\n\nWhile Gukesh said he was ready to play in India, Ding, who won the world title against Russian grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi in a match in Astana, Kazakhstan, in 2023, had voiced concerns about the prospect of a match with huge local support for his opponent. The Chinese said he preferred a third – and neutral – country such as Singapore.\n\nFIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich thanked New Delhi and Chennai for submitting bids but was also delighted that Singapore had won the hosting rights.\n\n“Not only is Singapore one of the most iconic global tourist and business hubs, it is also a thriving chess centre with great ambitions and talent,” he said.\n\nThe All India Chess Federation (AICF) was “disappointed” at not winning the bid, but said it was proud of the effort made to bring the big-ticket event to the country.\n\n“While we are naturally a little disappointed that our bid did not succeed, we are proud of the robust and compelling proposals put forth by us,” AICF president Nitin Narang said.\n\nHe added that the AICF will support Gukesh to the hilt in the historic match.\n\n“We are confident Singapore will deliver an outstanding championship, and we look forward to supporting our player Gukesh as he competes for the title on the global stage,” Narang said.\n\nFurther explaining the reasoning behind FIDE’s choice of the venue for the much-anticipated clash, its press relations officer Anna Volkova told PTI that maintaining neutrality was one of the key factors.\n\n“Neutrality was clearly a major factor in deciding the winning bid. Also, it was important for us to bring the FIDE flagship event to a new region. But it has to be said – all that would not work if Singapore’s bid was not good enough. It was very strong,” she said.\n\nSingapore reportedly submitted a bid on May 31, and it was approved after FIDE inspections on June 11 and 12. The 14-game match is slated to take place between Nov 20 and Dec 15 this year.\n\nThe exact venue is yet to be determined. FIDE said four venues are being considered.\n\n“Neutrality was clearly a major factor in deciding the winning bid.

A group of devotees had organised the event, according to a poster at the site.\n\nThe preacher’s lawyer A.P. Singh said Baba had never asked anyone to touch his feet nor did he give anyone the dust touched by his feet, referring to reports in local media which cited these as reasons for the devotees running towards him.\n\nMr Singh also said Baba’s aides were ready to help those who suffered in the incident.\n\nMost of the deaths resulted from suffocation, said doctors at a district hospital treating several victims. Among the 121 dead were 112 women and seven children, while 31 were injured, state authorities said.\n\nIn their First Information Report, police described a scene of chaos when the preacher was leaving in his car.\n\nThousands of devotees shouted and ran towards the vehicle, crushing others still seated, the report said. Some people were trampled after falling in an adjacent field of slush and mud.\n\nIn a letter seen by Reuters, a junior officer present at the event told the district administrator that the preacher’s security staff had stopped the devotees running towards the car and that many of them fell to the ground.\n\nSome had run towards open fields nearby to escape the stampede but slipped and fell in the path of the rest of the crowd, the officer added.\n\nPeople fell on top of each other as they tumbled down a slope into a water-logged ditch, witnesses told AFP.\n\n“Everyone – the entire crowd, including women and children – all left from the event site at once,” said police officer Sheela Maurya, 50, who had been on duty on Tuesday.\n\n“There wasn’t enough space, and everyone just fell on top of each other.”\n\nOfficials suggested the stampede was triggered when worshippers tried to gather soil from the footsteps of the preacher, while others blamed a dust storm for sparking panic.\n\nSome fainted from the force of the crowd, before falling and being trampled upon, unable to move.\n\nMs Maurya was among the injured. “I tried to help some women, but even I fainted and was crushed under the crowd,” she said. “I don’t know, but someone pulled me out, and I don’t remember much.”\n\nMs Maurya said she had worked at several political rallies and large events in the past but had “never seen such huge numbers”.\n\n“It was very hot, even I fell there and I survived with great difficulty”, she added.\n\nAmong the dead was Ms Ruby, 30, who had travelled more than 300km to attend the event, along with her father Chedilal.\n\nDescribing the stampede, Mr Chedilal, 68, told Reuters: “I heard terrifying screams from women and there were bodies piled up on the ground near the exit.”\n\n“I was scared, I ran away and started calling my daughter on the phone.”\n\nAfter an agonising night of hospital visits to locate his daughter, Mr Chedilal said he finally found her body at the Hathras district hospital in the morning.\n\nThe state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath met some of the injured on Wednesday and inspected the site, which stands amid paddy fields beside a busy highway. Waste littered the site, which was partly inundated by rainfall.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of US$2,400 to the next of kin of those who died and US$600 to those injured in the “tragic incident”.\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu said the deaths were “heart-rending” and offered her “deepest condolences”.\n\nStampedes and other accidents are not uncommon at religious gatherings involving large crowds in India, with most being blamed on poor crowd management.\n\nReuters, AFP\n\n“I heard terrifying screams from women and there were bodies piled up on the ground near the exit.”\n\nMr Chedilal, whose daughter Ruby died in the stampede", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/505547f9724259c440838e3ef600a03bf949edda8af39745d480a80d507466a5?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives mourn the death of stampede victims Kamlesh Jatav, 22, and her seven-month-old daughter in Daunkeli village."}]}

Shanmugam used an interesting economic metaphor when he said this week that issues of race and religion cannot be dealt with by taking a laissez-faire approach. Instead, Singapore intervenes heavily to ensure social cohesion and has tough laws to deal with the minority who choose to be nasty towards people with different characteristics.\n\nHe was speaking at a forum on non-violent ethnic hostilities organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Institute of Policy Studies on Monday.\n\n“Laissez-faire” refers to an economic philosophy that advocates minimal government interference in the economy, a philosophy propagated by French physiocratic economists who were early proponents of a free-market economy.\n\nLaissez-faire economists would permit government involvement in only three functions: protecting national frontiers by means of a standing army; protecting private property rights and personal freedom through a police force and the judiciary; and producing public goods such as parks and libraries that the market would have no incentive to produce on its own.\n\nAt the heart of the theory is the postulate that markets work best when demand and supply are allowed to meet in a natural equilibrium, that is, without the government playing a regulatory economic role.\n\nThe limitations of laissez-faire thinking were laid bare by the Great Depression of the 1930s that led directly to World War II. It took the genius of the Cambridge economist John Maynard Keynes to argue for forceful government intervention to get the economy rolling again.\n\nKeynes was not only a great economist but a trenchant social philosopher as well. He wrote: “The world is\n\nnot\n\nso governed from above that private and social interest always coincide. It is\n\nnot\n\nso managed here below that in practice they coincide. It is\n\nnot\n\na correct deduction from the principles of economics that enlightened self-interest always operates in the public interest. Nor is it true that self-interest generally is enlightened.”\n\nHence the need for the agency of governance. Keynes argued that governments should solve problems in the short run rather than wait for market forces to do so over the long run because “in the long run, we are all dead”.\n\nIf this is true of economic life, how much truer is it not of social life?\n\nRace and religion are markers of Singapore’s social life that have often turned violent. The Maria Hertogh riots of 1950 and the succeeding racial violence of 1964 and 1969 revealed just how fragile peace could be once it was confronted by visceral emotions roused to violent indignation by clever instigation. The 1964 riots were orchestrated by foreign elements inimical to the political evolution of Singapore society. The 1969 violence spilled over from abroad.\n\nSince then, the ethnic peace and tolerance that Singaporeans have come to take for granted have not been achieved by a natural growth of inter-ethnic goodwill. They have resulted from the institution and application of laws that protect the peaceful majority from the ethnic machinations of the manipulative few\n\nLaws that influence the operation of ethnicity in Singapore include the self-explanatory Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. Those laws are backed by policies that go to the heart of everyday social life in Singapore.\n\nThe Ethnic Integration Policy that applies to public housing, in which the vast majority of Singaporeans live, ensures that ethnic enclaves do not form and that they do not solidify because of the purchasing power of the majority Chinese. Without that policy, laissez-faire economics could well have driven the minorities to the demographic margins of Singapore society, where they might have lived in a vicariously happy version of housing apartheid.\n\nEthnic enclaves are never good for society. France, where the far right is currently eyeing power after its electoral successes in the first round of parliamentary elections, was the scene of historic riots in 2005 when suburban fringes inhabited heavily by immigrants erupted in violence after two minority teenagers fleeing the police were electrocuted in a power substation.\n\nThe insurrection by an incensed French minority helped to rouse the political interest of semi-fascist French political forces whose collective political ambition have come now to the parliamentary fore. French banlieues – suburban neighbourhoods – are not a template of Singapore housing, and should never be.\n\nInstead, Singaporeans need to work hard to ensure that they are not divided within their nation even as divisions proliferate outside their borders. The rise of countervailing ethnocentric powers in Asia, and the ethnic affiliations with them originating in Singapore’s own immigrant history, is cause for immense concern.\n\nThe Government owes citizens the existential duty of doing its best so that Singapore society is not fragmented by the centrifugal pulls of external national actors or by the divisive potential of external events over which it exercises no control. Whether it is the edgy contest for global supremacy between China and America, or the grinding war of attrition being waged by Hamas and Israel, Singapore must remain Singapore.\n\nAs Mr Shanmugam has warned, Singapore cannot afford to take a laissez-faire approach to race and religion. The Government must continue to intervene decisively and indeed pre-emptively so that this country remains home to all its citizens.\n\nThe writer is a former Straits Times\n\njournalist.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5fdd43f28a682b590aaaae675dfb545fdec5196aa02df658363bb1a6824f86a6?w=825", "alt_text": "Riot squad and the Federal Reserve Police Unit at a trouble spot in Geylang during the 1964 racial riots."}]}

Siddharth takes on a David-esque role in the film, with Suryah making an extended cameo as a villain.\n\nTo a thrilled 1,200 crowd at the fans’ meet, Kamal expressed gratitude for their enthusiasm and sought support for the third instalment of Indian which is speculated to release next year. He also thanked the Singapore artistes who did tribute performances.\n\nAmong the crowd was 69-year-old Panjavarnam Jeyaraman, an eager mother and grandmother who had used Kamal’s didactic films to teach moral norms to her children. “Senapathy is not just a film character, he is a social icon,” she professed.\n\nWhile the trailer and music of Indian 2 have garnered mixed reviews from netizens, polytechnic student Agnes Diva, 18, believes that Anirudh’s “vibey” music underscores the film’s contemporary and modern appeal.\n\nTechnician Sundar, 33, recounted how transfixed he was as a youth watching Indian in theatres. He noted that the action-packed trailer only promises Shankar’s signature larger-than-life filmmaking. He and his three friends, who attended the fan meet, were thankful to see their idol in real life.\n\nMs K. Sabrina’s family tradition is to catch every Kamal film in a theatre on release day. The 22-year-old undergraduate hopes that Indian 2 uses its power to highlight the most pertinent social issues that youth should turn their attention to.\n\nFinalised within five days, the event took much coordination and planning, commented S. S. Vikneshwaran, executive producer of Cosmic Ultima Pictures. Co-organiser J.K. Saravana, founder of Tantra Inc, emphasised the organisers’ commitment to showcasing local artistes at the event and noted Kamal’s admiration for their performances.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7604f4cc4bee428192db496451c25eed28a02031d0745adce867f8e81255c8a0?w=825", "alt_text": "Kamal Haasan with performers and fans at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre."}]}

Pritzker’s venture capital firm.\n\nThe verdict, handed down by US District Judge Thomas Durkin, closed the lid on one of the largest corporate fraud cases in recent history.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Outcome Health was the brainchild of Mr Shah during his university days. Originally known as Context Media Health, the company was founded in 2006 with a vision of changing medical advertising through installing televisions at doctors’ offices to stream health ads targeted at patients.\n\nMr Shah was joined by Shradha Agarwal as a founder, and the growth for the company became exponential as far as valuation was concerned.\n\nBy 2015, Outcome had emerged as a big player in the tech and healthcare investment communities. The promise of meshing cutting-edge technology into traditional healthcare marketing beckoned high-profile investors. During its meteoric rise, Outcome was securing enormous funds and clientele, placing Mr Shah as a rising star in Chicago corporate circles.\n\nBut, behind the glittering success, Outcome’s foundations were rotting. Prosecutors said Mr Shah, 38, along with Ms Agarwal and another defendant, chief financial officer Brad Purdy, engaged in a scheme of monumental fraud against investors, clients and lenders by misrepresenting the operational and financial health of the company.\n\nAt the centre of the fraud was selling more advertising inventory than could be delivered by Outcome, and fabricating data to cover up the shortfall, reported NDTV.\n\nIt misled pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk and other clients about its network size and ad reach. Combined with fraudulent data, Outcome painted a picture of exponential revenue growth that beguiled further investment or financial backing.\n\nMr Shah lived life to the fullest because the money rolling in from the inflated ad sales and financing from investors was huge. Reports exposed this spending habit, featuring exotic trips with private jets and yachts, even the purchase of a US$10 million home.\n\nIn 2016, Mr Shah’s net worth was pegged at more than US$4 billion, reflecting an amount depreciated and inflated by a raft of duplicitous accounting practices.\n\nThe facade began to crumble in 2017 when a media expose by the Wall Street Journal brought the fraudulent activities to light.\n\nLater, a group of investors that included Goldman Sachs, Alphabet and Governor Pritzker’s firm filed lawsuits against Outcome, accusing the firm of fraud in its US$487.5 million fundraising earlier in the year. The fundraiser had returned a US$225 million dividend for Mr Shah and Ms Agarwal but left investors holding a grossly overvalued stake in a company teetering on collapse.\n\nMr Shah was indicted on more than a dozen counts of fraud and money laundering until he was convicted of these charges in April 2023.\n\nWhile the prosecutors asked for 15 years for Mr Shah and 10 years for his co-conspirators, District Judge Durkin’s final rulings were disparate and included a three-year sentence for Ms Agarwal in a halfway house and Mr Purdy two years and three months in prison.\n\nMr Shah, in ill health, spoke of remorse and accepted responsibility at sentencing.  “The culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to a client question,” he confessed.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3d9fa78ca4cefd0e1e54a8cf74a44bbb390de694b50e1b4623c6ce527c8fff87?w=825", "alt_text": "Shradha Agarwal and Rishi Shah."}]}

I wondered what Shivam Dube, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj and Yuzvendra Chahal would do in the United States and West Indies against quality opposition.\n\nThere were certainly more deserving players, such as Rinku Singh, T. Natarajan, Sandeep Sharma and Ravi Bishnoi, who should have made the trip.\n\nWhy go with three left-arm spinners and seven left-handed batsmen?\n\nThe form of some of the players too was middling. Many in the squad did not have an outstanding Indian Premier League (IPL) season.\n\nSo, at best, they would make the Super Eight, I thought.\n\nHow wrong I was proved.\n\nOn a drop-in pitch with variable bounce in New York, India beat fierce rivals Pakistan.\n\nThen, on a trot, they beat the fancied teams – Australia, England and South Africa.\n\nOf course, there were tense moments. But, always, they emerged triumphant with a never-give-up attitude.\n\nOften India were bailed out by the bowlers. Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel were superb.\n\nThey turned matches around when the batsmen found the going tough on slow, under-prepared pitches in windy conditions.\n\nBumrah is undoubtedly the best T20 bowler in the world. No opposing batter faced him with confidence. He produced wickets at crucial moments and deservedly won the Player of the Tournament award.\n\nIndia went with Virat Kohli as an opener, when he has scored more runs as No. 3.\n\nPerhaps coach Rahul Dravid’s reasoning was India’s best batters – captain Rohit Sharma, Kohli, Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav – should play at the top.\n\nA right-left opening combo – Rohit and Yashaswi Jaiswal – with Kohli going in at No. 3 would have been ideal, giving Kohli ample time to judge the conditions and play the anchor role to perfection. But then he was asked to open and flopped in eight matches.\n\nA class batter, however, cannot be kept quiet for long. He fired in the final against South Africa in Bridgetown, Barbados, helping India to total 176-7 in 20 overs.\n\nIndia’s batting story was blistering knocks from Rohit against Australia and England, Surya’s cameos in three matches and useful contributions from Pant, Hardik and Patel.\n\nWhat stood out was the excellent Indian fielding. Patel plucked a catch out of thin air against Australia and Surya produced a stunner against South Africa. Both were game changers. Earlier, Siraj also pouched one near the boundary line that was crucial in denying Pakistan victory.\n\nIndian fielding standards have improved tremendously, and that was seen when South Africa were restricted to 169-8 in 20 overs in the final.\n\nSouth Africa in the final stages of the match needed just 30 runs off 30 balls, which was easy for an international team of their calibre. But they were undone by an Indian team who fought hard until the end.\n\nOverall, it was the ability to handle pressure with composure that saw India through. Just when it looked like Australia and South Africa would win, Indian bounced back and beat them.\n\nThere were murmurs that venues were picked to favour India and the side had less match-to-match travelling to do. Also, to some eyes Surya’s catch in the final was not fair as he slightly disturbed the boundary cushion.\n\nAll those don’t really matter. India, by far, were the most united and competitive team on show. Each player was given a specific role and each delivered in style.\n\nCaptain and vice-captain had issues during the IPL. But, importantly, Rohit and Hardik delivered together in the World Cup, with Rohit planting a kiss on Hardik’s cheek to acknowledge the all-rounder’s significant role.\n\nIndia lost in the final of the World Test Championship and One-Day World Cup last year. The third time they were not to be denied cricket’s ultimate triumph.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/70b796ab5d3b58f7ece401f0daa7fc5b338198c499c637b66248c7aa2369b04c?w=825", "alt_text": "Captain Rohit Sharma savouring India’s T20 World Cup win at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, on June 29."}]}

It says they were needed as colonial laws had been at the core of the criminal justice system for more than a century.\n\nAmong the key changes is replacement of the sedition law frequently used as a tool of suppression, after its enactment under British colonial rule to jail Indian freedom fighters.\n\nUnder the new laws, sedition is replaced with a section on acts seen as “endangering the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India”.\n\nLaws dealing with sexual assault have been strengthened, while a previous law criminalising sodomy has been removed. Other key changes include the amount of time police can hold a suspect rising from 15 days to 60, and, in some special cases, up to 90.\n\n“About 77 years after independence, our criminal justice system is becoming completely indigenous and will run on Indian ethos,” India’s Home Minister Amit Shah said. “Instead of punishment, there will now be justice.”\n\nCriminal cases registered under the repealed laws before Monday will continue to follow them, Mr Shah said, adding that the first case logged under the new law was that of a motorcycle theft in the central city of Gwalior, registered 10 minutes after midnight.\n\n“The laws were debated for three months. It is not fair to give political colour to this big improvement happening after centuries. I ask the opposition parties to support this legislation,” Mr Shah said.\n\nIndia’s top judge DY Chandrachud praised the new laws as a “watershed moment for our society”.\n\nBut the opposition said they were rolled out without a discussion in the parliament, while other critics said it could worsen an already glacially slow pace of justice.\n\nOpposition Congress party leader P. Chidambaram said the previous parliament session did not hold any “worthwhile debate” before passing the laws.\n\nHe said that there was only marginal improvement in the new laws, which could have been introduced as amendments to existing laws.\n\n“The initial impact will be to throw the administration of criminal justice into disarray,” he posted on X.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper said in an editorial that criminal justice reform should not be “a one-time solution or one that just takes place in the books”, and called for police reform and addressing gaps in judicial infrastructure.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7b04e667b5266563eeec817f88b9add7b3bb6f5ee663030a3cce225575d75695?w=825", "alt_text": "The Central Hall of Parliament in New Delhi."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIt has become customary for Mrs Lalythambika Rice to visit Singapore at least once in four years.\n\nThe 74-year-old, who left the island in 1972 to settle in the United Kingdom with her parents and other members of her family, makes the trips to spend time with her elder sister Sarojini and relatives and friends who live here.\n\nBut the journey this June was special. She learnt the Indian Heritage Centre was organising a heritage trail tour of the Sembawang area and wanted to be on the bus to rekindle memories.\n\nOn June 22, her hearbeat quickened as she clambered aboard the bus, anxious to know what the place where she spent her childhood would be like.\n\n“It’s totally different. I couldn’t recognise anything,” she told tabla!. “There was nothing there, except the old colonial bungalows where the British officers resided.”\n\nShe was referring to the British naval base in Sembawang which in its heyday – from the 1940s to the 1960s – housed more than 4,000 Malayalee families, like her own. They were from Kerala, a state in South India. There were also several others from different Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.\n\n“My father V.S. Chellappan arrived from Varkala (a town in South Kerala)  in 1938 to work at the naval base when he was 19 years old,” she said. “He was a bus driver and later married my mother Narasamma, who was from Andhra. Together they had three children, I and my elder sisters Sarojini and Chandramathi.\n\n“All of us spent our lives at the naval base till 1972 when it closed. I cherish those memories. We lived a simple lifestyle but enjoyed the time spent with other Indians, Chinese and Malays in the sprawling area. There were several Malayalees and we were a close-knit group.\n\n“I studied at the Canberra Primary School and the Naval Base Secondary school and was very active in the cultural scene, performing bharatanatyam and taking part in other social events.”\n\nLike Mr Chellappan, thousands of Malayalees began arriving from Kerala in the early 1900s to work at the naval base in different capacities, ranging from dockyard workers to administrative clerks. The British, who ruled Singapore at the time, wanted a strong workforce and considered the Malayalees hardworking and dependable.\n\n“Most of them got the jobs through word of mouth,” said Mr P.N. Balji, 75, the former editor of The New Paper who grew up in the naval base. “It was common for a Malayalee who worked there to bring family members or friends from Kerala to join him. Most of them came from South Kerala, districts like Trivandrum and Quilon. There were a few from North Kerala, like Malabar, from where my father hailed.”\n\nMost men who came from Kerala were bachelors. Some had wives and children back home, while many married in Singapore later and had children.\n\nAll of them lived in blocks allocated by the British inside the naval base. There were separate quarters for bachelors.\n\n“The naval base earned the name Kochu Keralam or Little Kerala because the Malayalees were dominant,” said Mr Balji. “They loved to portray their culture, and traditional festivals such as Onam and Vishu were celebrated with gusto. Even the British admirals took part in the festivities, sitting in the front row in their white uniforms along with their well-dressed wives.”\n\nThe naval base was self-contained, with its own schools, hospital, provision stores, movie theatres, police station, swimming pools and football fields.\n\n“It was difficult for outsiders to enter the naval base without a pass,” said Mr Balji. “Even then a member of the household had to go to the gate and take them in with permission from the guards.”\n\nAccording to independent researcher Marcus Ng, the naval base at that time was a city on its own, second only to Singapore’s city-centre.\n\n“It was tucked away in the northern end of Singapore, but if you look at it closely, its development was central to the growth of Singapore and the region at large,” he said.\n\n“The King George VI dockyard, when it opened in 1938, was the biggest in the world, servicing naval ships all the way up to Australia. And the naval base spread up to 54 sq km, all the way from Sembawang to Woodlands, ending near the Causeway and taking up almost the entire northern shoreline of Singapore.\n\n“It was a major urban centre, well-developed, bustling with activities and multi-racial.”\n\nMr Ng pointed out that more than 10,000 people worked at the naval base in the 1950s and 1960s with some staying in nearby Nee Soon, Chong Pang and Yishun.\n\n“The Malayalees had a strong identity,” he said. “Important to them was education, culture and literacy. They liked to speak Malayalam and dressed traditionally. Some wore shorts. They also had classes for students to learn the Malayalam language and the traditional dances.”\n\nMr R. Asokan, personal care officer at the Sree Narayana Mission who studied at the Naval Base Secondary School, said that the Malayalees were also strong unionists. “There were rival unions and the leaders were mostly Malayalees,” said the 72-year-old. “They stood up for the workers’ rights and made big demands. It was typical of them because communism was then popular in Kerala and most of them came from a proletarian background.”\n\nPolitical leaders from Kerala used to be looked up to then. Some even visited the naval base, including Mr Raman Sankar in 1961. He became Kerala’s chief minister in 1962 and held the post till 1964.\n\nMrs Lalythambika has a photo in her album which shows her dressed in a skirt and walking alongside Mr Sankar along with other Malayalees when he toured the naval base.\n\nAll the unions, however, were disbanded by the government in 1963 and the leaders arrested.\n\nSimilarly, all the housing blocks in the naval base began to be demolished from 1972, soon after the British left Singapore in 1971. The dockyard had been handed over to Singapore ownership in 1968 and was renamed Sembawang Shipyard.\n\n“The Malayalees at the naval base had to make a decision, whether to return to India, take up British citizenship and move to the United Kingdom or stay in Singapore,” said assistant curator at the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) Liviniya P, who helped put together an exhibition called Ente Veedu, My Home: Malayalees in Singapore which is on at the IHC till September. “Some went back to Kerala and some moved to the UK, while a big chunk preferred to stay in Singapore.”\n\nSome of those who went back to Kerala struggled to find jobs and lived miserable lives, according to reports. Those who went to the UK, like Mrs Lalythambika’s family, settled in East London, which soon earned the moniker Little Kerala.  She now lives in Milton Keynes with her English husband Dr Lory Rice, who was attached to the Medical Research Council and Oxford University’s physics department, and their two children.\n\nThose who remained in Singapore, like Mr Balji’s family, took up local jobs, with their children adapting to life here.\n\n“The Sree Narayana Mission, Kerala Library and Singapore Kathakali Yogam are the naval base Malayalees’ legacies,” said Ms Liviniya. “They spent a lot of their time in these institutions, and it is where they still continue to meet in their old age.”\n\nA Malayalee family at their Sembawang residence in the 1960s\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Dinesh Vasu Dash\n\nEntrance to naval base in 1971.\n\nPhoto: The Straits Times.\n\n“The naval base earned the name Kochu Keralam or Little Kerala because the Malayalees were dominant.

Mrs Madhavan, Mr Chetty’s granddaughter from his second wife, along with her father, Mr Nalli Duraiswami Chetty, are directors and shareholders of NPL in Singapore.\n\nOn the other side are Mr Nalli Kuppuswami Chetti and Mr Nalli Ramanathan, who are partners in Nalli Chinnasami Chetty in India and directors and shareholders of NCCPL in Singapore. They are descendants of Mr Chetty by his first wife.\n\nThe conflict stems from the use of the “Nalli” name by both parties, leading to trademark disputes and legal battles since 1992.\n\nIn 1997, the parties reached a settlement. The Deeds of Settlement allowed NCCPL and NPL to both use the name “Nalli” in their businesses in Singapore and register their trademarks.\n\nHowever, this settlement was disrupted in 2020, when NPL opened a new store at 2C Buffalo Road in Little India, sparking a legal dispute.\n\nA lawsuit was commenced on March 30, 2020 against NPL for breaking the Deeds of Settlement.\n\nNCCPL claimed that NPL breached the deeds of settlement. The respondents said that NPL broke the agreement by using the name Nalli incorrectly. They claimed NPL used the word Nalli as its business name instead of “Nalli Pte Ltd” by giving prominence to the word “Nalli” and significantly reducing the emphasis on the words “Pte Ltd” on its signage at the NPL shop at 2C Buffalo Road.\n\nThey also alleged that NPL used the words “Nalli” and “Nalli Singapore” both as a trademark and a business name on its marketing collateral, including its carrier bag, sari box and price card. They further said NPL had the words “Original Nalli Products” on its display case with the word “Nalli” being given prominence.\n\nNPL disputed the claims on several grounds, which Justice Andre Maniam rejected. On May 17, 2022, the High Court ruled in favour of NCCPL leading NPL to appeal the decision.\n\nNPL counterclaimed against NCCPL for similar offences. The case reached the Court of Appeal, which on May 27 overturned some of the High Court’s decisions, ruling that NPL was not at fault for breaching the Deeds of Settlement and that the appellants were not collectively responsible for trademark infringement.\n\nJustice Abdullah emphasised that the candle motif used by NPL conveyed a distinct concept from NCCPL’s cursive rendering of the word Nalli. Despite both trademarks containing the word Nalli, the court found that the differences in visuals and concepts were significant enough to prevent consumer confusion.\n\nClaims of malicious falsehood from both sides were dismissed.\n\nRenowned saree stores Nalli Chinnasami Chetty Pte Ltd (left) and Nalli Pte Ltd (right) along Buffalo Road at Little India.\n\nPhoto: TIMOTHY DAVID", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4ac6f0b200deb202b771d42ae43fc9a14beb5f4050d3d2a77dd57a745aedbd4e?w=825", "alt_text": "The Nalli Chinnasamy Chetty and Nalli Pte Ltd outlets on Buffalo Road."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFlamboyance still sits perfectly with Sockalingam Rajagopal.\n\nSporting a cap, Nike T-shirt and long hair during a recent visit to the Ceylon Sports Club, he looked every inch the dazzler he was on the football pitch and off it in the 1970s.\n\nAt age 75, Rajagopal does not follow the fortunes of the Singapore team. But in his heyday he made sure the national side shone with his exceptional skills.\n\n“He combined elegant balance and the ability to bend the ball through defences as if the football gods exclusively afforded him superhuman skills,” said football historian A. Thiyaga Raju, who wrote the book ROAR: Football Legends of Singapore.\n\n“One of Singapore’s most colourful attacking fullbacks, Rajagopal was known for his tireless galloping runs down the left flank which earned him the nickname ‘The Camel’. No one could match his jaw-dropping skills.”\n\nFree-kicks over the wall, around the wall and under it, banana kicks from corners, lobs, bicycle kicks, flicking the ball into the air and nestling it on his neck – Rajagopal could do everything.\n\nBut now all those deeds are in the past for him.\n\n“I don’t follow football seriously,” he told tabla! “I am mostly at home taking care of my wife. I just relax and sometimes sing old English songs at friends’ pubs and restaurants. Dean Martin is my favourite.”\n\nRajagopal and his second wife Melody Felipe live in Taytay, a municipality in the Philippines. He returns to Singapore occasionally.\n\n“Singapore is down in football, and that’s a problem,” he said.\n\n“This is mainly because the players don’t have good sparring partners. You can coach them as much as you want, but if they don’t get to play against European teams on a regular basis, their standard will not improve.\n\n“I started playing competitive football in secondary school and it blossomed because at 17 I was playing against the top teams in Singapore such as RAF Seletar and RAF Changi, which were full of strong and skilful British players who played in the English leagues. The standard was very high.”\n\nA shy boy from Hooper Road estate in Newton, Rajagopal was discovered at 14 by Singapore’s World Cup referee George Suppiah.\n\nGeorge, who was then coach of the Combined Schools team, spotted Rajagopal’s talent when he was playing for St. Andrew’s and later Monk’s Hill School.\n\nRajagopal’s best years with the national team were from 1975 to 1977 when he played a key role in helping Singapore qualify for the Malaysia Cup final in 1975, when they lost 1-0 to Selangor at the Merdeka Stadium on Aug 31 – Merdeka Day.\n\nArguably the fittest player in the team despite his party lifestyle off the pitch, Rajagopal also demonstrated his magic in the 1977 World Cup qualifiers against Thailand and Hong Kong and the Malaysia Cup semi-final against Selangor at the National Stadium that same year.\n\nAgainst Thailand, he scored a brilliant free kick which curled past the Thai wall and nestled in the net, giving Singapore a 2-0 win.\n\nAgainst Hong Kong, it was an exquisite cross from Rajagopal that Quah Kim Song headed home to salvage a 2-2 draw.\n\nIn the Malaysia Cup 1st leg semi-final of 1977, Rajagopal’s magical left foot gave Singapore the match-winner in a 2-1 win.\n\nEx-international Leong Kok Fann, 66, who grew up in Winstedt Drive, just opposite to Rajagopal’s block, said everyone in the estate would root for him.\n\n“We all looked up to him because he was simply outstanding,” Leong said.\n\n“The good thing about him was that he supported all the younger players, like forward N. Rajendran to whom he used to send 40m passes so he could score. Rajagopal could have played for any team, but he preferred to play for our Division 3 side Cairnhill FC, taking us all the way to Division 1.”\n\nIn August 1975, he was offered a three-year contract by Hong Kong first division clubs Caroline Hill and Mac-Kinnon for a monthly salary of $1,750.  But he declined due to work and family commitments.\n\nIn April 1978, Indian side Mohun Bagan too offered him a three-month contract. But again he refused due to family issues.\n\nMany believe Choo Seng Quee, arguably Singapore’s greatest football coach, taught Rajagopal the skills to excel. But Rajagopal, who did not get along with the strict disciplinarian, said it was all natural.\n\n“I developed my skills myself,” he said. “There was no one to teach me when I was studying at Monk’s Hill Secondary. All the skills I developed were due to playing a lot of football and against stronger teams.”\n\nFormer Singapore forward Roy Krishnan, 73, said Rajagopal had the uncanny ability to turn a match around with one of his kicks.\n\n“Without him I would have been finished,” Krishnan said.\n\n“He always fed me with good balls and told me to ‘go, go, go’. He is undoubtedly one of the best footballers Singapore has produced.”\n\nHowever, Rajagopal’s routine of pub visits, hangover training sessions, off-field incidents and late-night gallivanting resulted in numerous spats with officialdom.\n\nFormer national team trainer Justin Morais said Choo “did not like him because he did not listen to anyone”.\n\n“People made up stories about him, but he was never a drunkard,” said Morais\n\n“I kept a close watch on him and helped him recover from injuries. We are close and he visits me whenever he comes to Singapore.”\n\nRajagopal, together with Quah, Mohammed Noh and Dollah Kassim were the fan favourites during the 70s.\n\nBut he retired at 29 as he could not get along with some of the officials from the governing body.\n\n“I did not have a certificate, so I could not go into coaching,” said Rajagopal.\n\n“I worked for a while in Johor Bahru and then with a freight forwarding company in Singapore.\n\n“I don’t want fame or fortune, I just want to lead a happy life with my wife.”\n\nS Rajagopal shaking hands with Brazilian football legend Pele, before a match against Australia’s Bayswater United at the National Stadium in 1974.

It was made public this month after clearing legal challenges from film industry members.\n\nSeveral women have come forward to complain against top Malayalam actors and filmmakers, including actor Baburaj, who was the AMMA’s joint secretary before he too resigned.\n\nA junior artiste told NDTV that Baburaj raped her at his home in Ernakulam district in 2019, after inviting her there on the pretext of offering a role in one of his films.\n\nBaburaj has claimed the allegation is false and meant to scupper his chances of succeeding Siddique as general secretary of the film body.\n\nActress Minu Muneer accused prominent actors M.

Parameswaran told The Straits Times that it is unlikely Ms Gali has survived, after being trapped in the sewer system for days.\n\n“There are a few things that could have happened and (that’s) why the authorities have not found her yet,” he said. “The sewer system is full of toxic gas which would kill anyone without proper protection. She would have been poisoned the moment she fell in.\n\n“Sewage water is also very harsh, and the current has a minimum flow speed of 1m per second. Theoretically, she could have travelled up to 86.4km within 24 hours.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Ibrahim Mat Zin, better known as Raja Bomoh, offered his “expertise” and reportedly performed a ritual near where the woman fell in a bid to trace her.\n\n“We just want to help and ensure that everyone is safe,” he told Bernama. “We dont want anything untoward to occur.\n\n“We do not know if there are any dangerous animals such as snakes underneath,” he added, claiming that he was instructed to go to the scene by “an important figure”.\n\nMr Ibrahim, most notably remembered for his ritual involving coconuts at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 2014 shortly after the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines (MH370) flight, then proceeded to perform his ritual by sprinkling “special water” that he claimed was taken from the bottom of a waterfall in Perak.\n\nHis actions were widely criticised, with many saying the rituals contradict Islamic teachings and have embarrassed Malaysia and its people.\n\nOn Wednesday, the federal territories mufti’s office said it would summon Mr Ibrahim, after Religious Affairs Minister Na’im Mokhtar said his actions have caused public distress and misunderstandings about Islam.\n\nThe shocking sinkhole incident has turned the usually bustling shopping district of Jalan Masjid India into a mini ghost town as many shoppers have avoided the area amid concerns about other possible sinkholes occurring.\n\nOn Wednesday, a new sinkhole appeared in KL, just 50m away from where Ms Gali disappered. This collapse happened at about 2.30am after a storm.\n\nAlthough no casualties were reported, the second sinkhole prompted authorities to close the entire stretch of Jalan Masjid India, which is about 400m, to pedestrians and traffic. Footpaths remain open.\n\nThe area, which means Indian Mosque Road in Malay, is dominated by a large red mosque, a reflection of its Indian-Muslim heritage in the early days of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nLocated just two LRT stations away from Petronas Twin Towers, Jalan Masjid India is renowned for its goldsmiths and jewellers, as well as low-priced goods ranging from colourful Malay attire to Indian saris.\n\n“We’ve been hit very hard. There have been zero customers since the accident happened,” Maharaja Jewellers salesman Mohamed Nasir told The Straits Times.\n\nHe said the business has 15 employees and the company will be forced to dip into its savings if the situation does not improve.\n\n“I don’t mind the authorities closing up the main street, but at least allow some space for pedestrians to walk through,” said the 62-year-old, whose shop is located a mere 10m away from the sinkhole.\n\nSome shops near the sinkhole have remained shuttered due to the lack of business and traders’ concerns about safety.\n\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has vowed that the government will not give up in its efforts to find the unfortunate tourist, with more than 100 rescuers, including scuba-diving units, scouring the sewers.\n\nMr Ibrahim Mat Zain, also known as “Raja Bomoh” (King of Shamans) performing a ritual near the area.\n\nEPA-EFE", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/302a3a84db66cdb2f701b6b384f73ff4a83de128ae0f5a87dda5d14479e85f4b?w=825", "alt_text": "Relatives of the Indian woman who fell into an 8m-deep sinkhole waiting for news about her near the accident site in Kuala Lumpur."}]}

This was followed by the rakhi-tying ceremony.\n\n“It’s a wonderful way to celebrate Raksha Bandhan by tying rakhis to brothers from various Indian groups,” said Ms Padmaja Naidu, president of The Kamala Club. “It fostered a sense of unity and togetherness in the community.\n\n“This initiative also promotes the strengthening of relationships between different Indian organisations, sharing traditions and customs, creating a sense of belonging and paving the way for joint efforts.”\n\nThe Hindu Centre also launched its book, Parenting: The Hindu Way, through its president N.

In supporting these students, we are investing in the future of our community and our nation.”\n\nSIET shared with tabla! that from the past three editions of the tournament, it has raised around $660,000, supporting 104 beneficiaries with interest-free study loans totalling $900,000 over the last three years.\n\nEvent treasurer Abuthahir Abdul Gafoor said: “We’ve been organising this for 15 years now. It’s not just about the golf, it’s about coming together to support a cause we believe in. The money we raise today ensures that SIET can continue its good work, helping students achieve their dreams.\n\n“The highlight of the event was the overwhelming support from the community. “We have regular players who come back year after year.”\n\nMentioned during the event was the partnership between SIET and AT Capital, which saw a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the two entities earlier this year.\n\nThe MOU’s support system, including a robust seven-year mentorship programme, provides students with financial support, mentorship and career placement opportunities.\n\nLast year alone, around 500 students received bursaries, and 70 benefited from additional loans.\n\nThe MOU focuses on nurturing students from financially less well-off families such as Mr Salman Fasrudeen Sahul Hameed, 28, who was awarded a study loan from SIET.\n\n“It wasn’t just about the financial aid, the mentorship I received opened my eyes to opportunities I never knew existed and helped me build an invaluable network,” said Mr Salman, who works at an IT multinational company.\n\nThe support spurred him to graduate within the top 10 per cent of his cohort at Temasek Polytechnic’s electronic engineering course and eventually, a first-class honours bachelor’s degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Teeside University in the UK.\n\n“Events like these are more than just fundraisers – they are a testament to the power of community spirit.\n\nMinister of State for Law and Transport Murali Pillai (left)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6cf38ffce0fce382027a8b1997c37eb892d0460aa585e0e8bf1dfbfb307e8614?w=825", "alt_text": "Minister of State for Law and Transport Murali Pillai."}]}

Shanmugam, Digital Development and Information Minister Josephine Teo, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.\n\nThe Indian delegation comprised Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Railway and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.\n\nCalling the meeting “productive”, Mr Balakrishnan said: “We will, very shortly, be announcing an official visit by Prime Minister Modi to Singapore. I cannot give you the specific date, but it will occur shortly.”\n\nDuring the multi-ministerial meeting, the two countries discussed ways to boost bilateral cooperation in the digital arena, skill development, sustainability, healthcare, connectivity and manufacturing.\n\nMr Balakrishnan said that advanced manufacturing and semiconductors, as well as aviation and maritime connectivity, are the new areas that Singapore and India have added to their bilateral talks.\n\n“A country with more than 1.4 billion people is now embarking on a major upgrade of its aviation sector. This is a once in a two, three-decade opportunity, and it’s good that we are, in a sense, in the front seat and have a chance (to collaborate),” he said.\n\nBesides a link-up between Singapore’s PayNow and India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in February 2023, which lets financial institutions from both sides transfer funds in real time, the two countries have also facilitated investments in renewable energy, such as green ammonia.\n\nMr Balakrishnan said projects like the digital payments linkage have much more potential, such as to become part of a regional instant payments system.\n\nSuch a network will facilitate trade and economic development across the region, he added.\n\nThat is why cyber security was discussed at the latest roundtable, alongside other ideas on standardising rules and increasing inter-operability so that other countries that want to be part of this network in future can do so more easily, the foreign minister added.\n\nAt a dinner following the roundtable meeting, DPM Gan said Singapore and India are natural partners with complementary strengths that have allowed both sides to forge strong economic and investment ties.\n\nIndian companies also form one of the largest foreign corporate contingents in Singapore, he noted.\n\n“I am confident that the discussions we had today and those in the future will pave the way to foster greater collaboration between Singapore and India,” Mr Gan said.\n\nThis was the second time that ministers from Singapore and India met at the ISMR, after its inaugural edition was launched in September 2022 by then Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\n\nMr Wong, who has since become prime minister, said he was glad that new ideas for cooperation are being pursued, while progress has been made on several fronts since the 2022 meeting.\n\nAt that meeting, both sides agreed to boost cooperation in several areas, including digitisation, green economy, skills development, healthcare and food cooperation, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\n“A country with more than 1.4 billion people is now embarking on a major upgrade of its aviation sector.

Strangely, that didn’t apply to our shorts and shirts.\n\nHantam bola – Malay for “hitting with a ball” – was another popular game during recess as it only required one tennis ball for all of us to play.\n\nDivided into two teams, we would pass the ball to team members so as to target a member of the opposing team. The person with the ball cannot run with it so there was some strategy involved in getting the thrower close enough to deliver a stinging shot.\n\nSometimes, we would pause our game just to wave at the passengers on the Malaysian train that ran beside the school.\n\nThen, to everyone’s dismay, the school bell would signal the end of recess, and we would troop into the classroom with our sweat-drenched shirts plastered to our backs. One teacher was not impressed with this spectacle and declared that pupils would not be allowed in until their shirts were dry.\n\nWe continued playing football during recess after that day – but without our shirts, which did not reflect too well on the school’s image.\n\nThen, there was tikam-tikam, a Malay phrase that means “random choice”.

Kavi\n\nAnusha Selvamani\n\nMohammad Nasir’s mother used to grumble whenever he spent ridiculous amounts of money on Marvel figurines.\n\nBut the nagging came to a halt one day when he sold a figurine for $1,200, making a profit of $800.\n\nMr Nasir, 40, has a total of 115 figurines in his collection to date – all stored carefully and categorically in the allocated work space of his five-room Tampines HDB flat.\n\nIndeed, entering the room felt much like entering a mini Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with figurines inside a glass display case arranged in a manner leaping, flying and sparring.\n\n“When you buy these toys, you have to assemble the parts yourself.\n\n“Sometimes, it can take me a day to complete one. So I have to make sure that they are squeaky clean,” said Mr Nasir, a father of two who works for a hardware company and runs a wedding photography business on the side.\n\nAn avid fan of MCU films, Mr Nasir began his collection at the age of 20, while in national service.\n\n“I got my first figurine from the Action City shop at Vivocity. Collecting them provides me with joy and solace amid a busy life,” he said with a laugh.\n\nHe recalled how his mother could not apprehend his obsession.\n\n“She felt it was a total waste of money to spend hundreds of dollars on toys,” said Mr Nasir, who has spent close to $60,000 over the years on his “toys”, and around $8,000 on renovating his hobby room.\n\nBut he feels that “everyone should have a hobby”, and is happy that his wife has been supportive of his endeavours.\n\nMr Nasir noted that his hobby can sometimes be a form of investment too.\n\nHalf of his home renovation cost, which amounted to $80,000, came from selling off his watch collection, comprising mostly G-Shock frogman watches that cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000.\n\n“There are some figurines that I have sold for a higher price than what I bought them for. Right now, I am not keen on selling the figurines, but if I need to, I will,” he said.\n\nIn his collection, he has most of the characters featured in the Marvel movies – Hulk, Ant Man, Iron Man, Wolverine, to name a few.\n\nHis favourite figurine is his Iron Man one.\n\n“Iron Man resonates with me because he reflects technology and engineering,” he explained.\n\nMr Nasir said the most expensive piece he bought was a Thanos figurine, which cost him $1,500.\n\n“Sometimes I just stare at my figurines and I slowly refresh the movie scenes in my mind,” he said, admitting that he is an “impulse buyer”.\n\n“I buy figurines once every two months. The moment I see a nice figurine on the social media pages I follow, I make sure to grab it quickly.”\n\nAside from Marvel figurines, Mr Nasir also collects figurines from movies like Terminator. He also has Captain America’s shield and Thor’s hammer.\n\nUnlike their father, Mr Nasir’s children – an 8-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter – don’t possess an interest in toy collectibles.\n\n“They used to collect toys when they were younger, but their interest did not last,” Mr Nasir said.\n\n“Whenever my friends’ children visit my house, they would be so mesmerised seeing my figurines, they would just stand in awe,” said Mr Nasir, who added that he has since influenced two friends to start collecting figurines.\n\n“I think this passion will stay with me for a while… I’m planning to collect the latest Deadpool and Wolverine figurines next.”\n\n“Sometimes I just stare at my figurines and I slowly refresh the movie scenes in my mind.”\n\nMohammad Nasir, who has a Marvel figurine collection at home worth over $60,000", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/91f5eed97e5a502d94f04196be49ffa82289e5e82c0fd012f39e7b076ee0e62e?w=825", "alt_text": "Mohammad Nasir has a Marvel figurine collection at home worth over $60,000"}]}

More than 100,000 political opponents, journalists and dissenters were imprisoned.\n\nBased on a screenplay by Ritesh Shah, the film features Anupam Kher, Shreyas Talpade, Vishak Nair, Mahima Chaudhry, Milind Soman and Satish Kaushik in pivotal roles.\n\nSikh bodies believe the movie aims to “create an anti-Sikh narrative about the martyrs of June 1984”.\n\nThe year saw anti-Sikh riots following the assassination of Mrs Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards, who were upset by the Indian government’s Operation Blue Star – a military operation carried out at Amritsar’s Golden Temple.\n\nReacting to the film and its premise, a video on social media shows a man saying: “I’m a very proud Indian. If I spot you anywhere in my country and in my Maharashtra, I’m saying this, not just as a Sikh and a proud Marathi, but all my Hindu, Christian and Muslim brothers will also welcome you with chappals.”\n\nKangana shared the video on her X handle and tagged Himachal, Punjab, and Maharashtra police requesting them to look into the matter.\n\nAnother person in the clip can be heard saying “History cannot be changed. If they portray Sikhs as terrorists in the film, then remember what happened to the person about whom the movie is being made (a reference to Mrs Gandhi’s assassination).”\n\nThe Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) have already demanded an immediate ban on Emergency, claiming it tries to “character assassinate” Sikhs.\n\nThe SGPC has issued a legal notice to the producers, demanding the removal of the movie’s trailer, which was released earlier this month, citing “anti-Sikh scenes”.\n\nSGPC secretary Partap Singh also wrote to the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting and the Central Board of Film Certification’s Chairperson seeking a ban on the film.\n\nThe issue has been brought before the High Court following a petition by Mr Gurinder Singh and Mr Jagmohan Singh – both residents of Mohali district in Punjab.\n\nIt sought directives to remove or delete scenes from the movie, arguing that they target the Sikh community by presenting false and misleading information.\n\nAdditionally, the petitioners have called for the Punjab Director-General of Police to register a police report against Kangana.\n\nKangana had announced Emergency in 2021, clarifying that, while it is a political drama, it is not a biopic of Mrs Gandhi.\n\nShe added that the film’s narrative delves into Mrs Gandhi’s political and personal life, with a special focus on the controversial Emergency period.\n\n“History cannot be changed.

Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nAlong the stretch of one of Singapore’s most infamous streets, you can get a scoop of homemade artisanal gelato for $5, purchase pottery starting at $35 or book a cat hotel family suite for $500 a night.\n\nIf you’re under 30, you’ll probably find it hard to believe that Desker Road in Little India was once known for transactions of a more seedy nature.\n\nOne of the oldest red light districts in Singapore, Desker Road has undergone a facelift of sorts. The shophouses in the area now play host to a variety of Indian restaurants. And if you’re sharp enough, you might also notice a cosy little French eatery called Allo.\n\nLocated on the ground floor of a shophouse built in 1903 (the year is proudly emblazoned on the building’s facade), Allo, with its modern chic interior design, is curiously out of place amid the sights and sounds of Little India.\n\nBut the offbeat location actually appealed to owner and head chef Andrew Seah, who opened the restaurant in 2021.\n\n“The building played an important part when we (him and his two partners) were searching for a space,” he told tabla! “It coincides with the concept of our restaurant. And the outside seating space also helped.”\n\nChef Andrew, 36, grinned when I asked him if he knew what Desker Road was known for back in the day.\n\n“Yes, I’m aware. And lots of people also ask me what’s a French restaurant doing in the middle of Little India,” he said.\n\n“But business here has been alright. Singaporeans will travel to eat, so the location isn’t really the most important thing; you just have to have good food.\n\n“Over here, we do get a few Indian customers. They come in a group, sometimes even for business meetings.”\n\nAs I dine at Allo on a packed Friday evening, I notice Indian representation right away – not in terms of the patrons, but a chef tossing pasta in a pan through an open-concept hole in the wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area.\n\nI learnt later on that the sous chef in question is Prince Koshinder, a migrant worker from Uttarakhand, who, in a glorious twist of fate, started out as a dishwasher before stepping up to helm the stove.\n\n“My previous head chef from Malaysia quit, and (Prince) showed a lot of interest in wanting to cook. He had the passion for it, and so I trained him and now he can do all the dishes,” said Chef Andrew, who manages the front-of-house.\n\nPrince, 23, started out at Allo shortly after it opened, and was a dishwasher for just five months before making the leap. He had no previous experience in the F&B sector, having worked in the automotive sector back in India.\n\n“I always wanted to learn how to cook, so I volunteered to learn. Chef trained me for about a month,” he said.\n\n“At first it was tough. I made a few mistakes like overcooking the tenderloin, but after a while, I knew how to check for doneness and do everything right.”\n\nEither Prince is a natural or Chef Andrew was a hell of a teacher.\n\nThe Lamb Rack with Pomme Puree ($42) was as good as any lamb dish you’ll savour at high-end establishments. What sets it apart are the delicious trimmings that accompany the three chops – lamb fat that they trim from the meat after grilling instead of before.\n\nThe menu also includes other classic French-inspired mains such as Duck Confit with Pomme Puree and Orange Balsamic Glaze ($30) and Beef Tenderloin with Potato Dauphinoise ($38).\n\nFor the wallet-conscious, Allo also offers a three-course weekday set lunch at $15.90+.\n\nChef Andrew, a Shatec graduate who has been a chef since 2009, has worked at various European eateries in Singapore, including Napoleon Restaurant in Telok Ayer and the RedBank Bar & Grill, where he was trained by Chef Nicolas Drouglazet from France.\n\n“It’s hard work, but it pays off when customers enjoy the food. That’s the best part about F&B,” he said.\n\n“The goal for us is to perhaps move to a bigger place someday. Ideally, I would like to open in Ang Mo Kio or Punggol – because we want to bring this cuisine to the heartlands.\n\n“You can see from our menu that the prices are relatively low. We just want more people to know about this cuisine and we want to make it affordable for them.”\n\nBefore I bade goodbye after a hearty meal, I asked Chef Andrew the reason for his restaurant’s name, which means “hello” in French.\n\n“The name is friendly. ‘Allo’ is an informal way of saying hello. It’s like us – casual, friendly dining.”\n\nAllo’s owner and head chef Andrew Seah with his sous chef Prince Koshinder.\n\nPhotos: T.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of IT giant Infosys; and Mr Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of Delhi.\n\nThe famous ones in Singapore are Mr Balwant Jain, CEO and founder of Optimum Solutions; Mr Vijay Iyengar, chairman and managing director of Agrocorp International; Mr Rohet Tolani, managing director at Tolani Shipping; and Mr Saurabh Mittal, founder and chairman of private investment company Mission Holdings.\n\n“Singapore is near India, and this is why IIT graduates like to come and work here,” said Mr Srinivasan Thirumalai, 59, who graduated from IIT Bombay in 1989 and came to Singapore in 1992. “They have been coming here since the 80s, but the increase in numbers started from the early 90s.\n\n“What we like about this place is the racial harmony,” added the deputy director at NTUitive, the innovation and enterprise company of Nanyang Technological University. “We don’t feel much different. The Indian and Chinese traditions are pretty much similar, and the government gives importance to all the cultures.”\n\nThe IIT graduates are comfortable with the working culture in Singapore too.\n\n“The people are thoroughly professional in Singapore, and they respect you for your work, rather than for your political leaning or race,” said gaming and finance entrepreneur Amit Raina, 45, who graduated from IIT Delhi and has been living in Singapore since 2001. “I would say Singapore is a very creative society. While some people may complain that we are taking away their jobs, the majority value the talent we bring.”\n\nThe IIT alumni, of whom many have taken up Singapore citizenship, believe they have contributed significantly to Singapore’s economy.\n\n“It is difficult to quantify. There’s definitely talent and we bring an exchange of ideas,” said Ms Priya Asthana, 42, a graduate from IIT Kanpur who runs the social enterprise Maths to Art in Singapore.\n\n“Socially too we have contributed. We hail from different states with their own value and belief systems. Bringing that culture here opens up society.”\n\nThe IITAAS, formed in 1995, too has been giving back to Singapore society through social and welfare projects. It has worked with government agencies and the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s ComLink+ to uplift lower-income families and provide them stability and social mobility.\n\nCurrently, IITAAS is exploring avenues with the Singapore Indian Development Association and Mendaki to participate in projects that will benefit the community at large.\n\n“We at IITAAS believe it is our responsibility, as foreigners who come to Singapore, to give back to society,” said Mr Jain. “Our welfare and social development projects have been guided by Singapore leaders such as the late former President S.R. Nathan, who was our patron when we held the PanIIT Asia Pacific conference at the Suntec Convention Centre in April 2012, and current President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who also attended the event.”\n\nIn recent years, given Singapore’s strict rules on employment passes and in granting permanent residency, many IIT graduates have preferred to seek employment in Dubai, Australia, US and UK where the cost of living is also much less. However, according to Mr Thirumalai, Singapore will always remain an attractive destination for them.\n\n“I told my professors, let me try Singapore for a few years as I wanted to do research,” he said. “Everything was so good that, after three years, I started working. Then I truly integrated with the Singaporean society. It was so smooth.\n\n“I got married when I was here and now I have three kids. There’s no reason for me to think anything is better than this. I had the chance of going back to India or staying here. I chose to stay here – and it’s been 32 years.”\n\n“While some people may complain that we are taking away their jobs, the majority value the talent we bring.”\n\nGaming and finance entrepreneur Amit Raina, who graduated from IIT Delhi and has been living in Singapore since 2001", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bd59e6d68ac5ebfb0ba58de145c149f78c0d873a1ec0169c9520f2dc41415ede?w=825", "alt_text": "IIT Alumni Association Singapore executive committee members (from left) Mr Kunal Arora, Mr Dhruv Jain, Mr Amit Gupta, Ms Leena Prakash, Mr Amit Mehta, Mr Ayush Kumar and Mr Thirumalai Srinivasan."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe High Commission of India (HCI) in Singapore organised a special Independence Day celebration on Aug 18 for about 250 Indian migrant workers and students at its premises with the twin aim of getting to know them and addressing their grievances.\n\nThe ceremonies started from 10am with breakfast and a flag-hoisting ceremony by India’s High Commissioner to Singapore Shilpak Ambule, before a question-and-answer session and a biryani lunch.\n\nIndia’s Independence Day falls on Aug 15.\n\n“We have large migrant worker and student communities in Singapore and our consular services section wanted to reach out to them and try and support them,” said Mr Ameya Abhyankar, head of HCI’s consular section.\n\n“The migrant workers are working six days a week, with only Sundays off, so we wanted to know what their problems were and provide them consular services at their dormitories as a form of goodwill.\n\n“Regarding students, we want them to be compliant with Singapore’s laws and help them with career opportunities and learning new skills.\n\n“We wanted to create a platform for them to understand how employment opportunities globally are shaping up and which jobs would best suit them.”\n\nThe migrant workers mostly raised issues related to passport services – accessing their passports during a family emergency in India and finding time to renew their passports.\n\nThere were also queries related to the power of attorney attestation that they require to renew their driving licences in India.\n\n“We understand that sometimes they need to take time off from work to come to the High Commission to solve their problems,” said Mr Abhyankar. “From now on, we will go to their dormitories on their days off and help them fill out forms and answer their queries.”\n\nThe HCI will start this initiative once a month with Westlite Accommodation, where most of the Indian migrant workers live.\n\n“The response to our requests was positive,” said safety professional Chinnu Veerappan, 45, who hails from Pudukottai in Tamil Nadu and has been working in Singapore for 12 years. “Often it is not possible for us to take a day’s leave and go to the High Commission to sort out our issues. Its staff coming to our places of residence will make it much easier and convenient for us.\n\n“We also pointed out that it is time to raise our daily wages.

Fundamentally, I have always been a creative person, and I think that’s what really motivates me.”\n\nAt the age of 14, Ashish, whose father is Indian and mother Chinese, got into debating “by accident”.\n\n“I was very noisy in class. And my teacher said you are very noisy, you should join the debate club. I was like, oh, there’s a debate club? You can do a CCA by just arguing with people? Now that sounds easy,” he recalls.\n\n“So I joined and found out it was actually very difficult. You need to know a lot of difficult things as well.”\n\nNonetheless, his passion for debate blossomed, and he went on to earn an unusually successful track record in the world of competitive debate in schools. At 19, he clinched the top prize at the World Schools Debating Championship in 2011, when he represented Singapore in the finals in Scotland. He also won the best speaker prize at the 2015 World University Debating Championship in Malaysia, where he represented the University of Cambridge.\n\nWhen I met Ashish, his unique, contrarian personality was on display as we spoke about popular culture, his family and life in general as he sees it.\n\nHe listens to classical music and enjoys sci-fi novels, but rues how badly the genre is often written – “I tried reading the 3 Body Problem and after two pages, I felt physically sick from the writing”.\n\nHe cites the dystopian thriller Civil War as a movie he enjoyed recently, but laments at how pretentious Christopher Nolan’s films have become since Memento.\n\nA typical day in his life involves strolling from his four-room flat in Woodlands to Causeway Point for his morning coffee, spending his afternoons writing or playing badminton and coaching debate classes or meeting friends in the evenings.\n\nHe limits his spending by eating at hawker centres or couchsurfing at friends’ homes when he travels. Part of his income also goes towards paying his parents a sum equivalent to rent for the room he occupies.\n\n“It’s very possible to live cheap in Singapore, especially when you take cars and housing out of the equation. I’ve never been very interested in luxury items and the finer things in life.”\n\nAshish admits that he knew being a slave to the grind was not something he could ever embrace or tolerate – even when he accepted his scholarship.\n\n“When I started working, I told myself to see how all of this would work out. And I did actually love my last few postings (especially his overseas stint in Brunei while with the MFA). But I’m just not a person for regimentation. And I hate being bored. So if something is boring, I just wouldn’t do it,” he says.\n\n“And then I thought, am I supposed to spend 40 years of my life waking up at nine and working till five? It seemed unthinkable as a way to go about living.”\n\nHe believes it is unlikely he will return to full-time paid work. He says his new lifestyle means no longer getting out of bed to pen e-mails he does not want to or attend meetings he sees as pointless. Instead, he is focused on trying to publish a novel and learning how to ride a motorcycle.\n\nThough he doesn’t see his choices as a reflection of the youth mindset in today’s society, Ashish says he would push back on the notion that he’s paving a path for anyone. “My circumstances are unusual. I do hope, though, that how I’m living can help people think about what they actually want at the end of the day.”\n\nHis parents, he says, are “totally fine” with his choices.\n\nHis father works at a Christian missionary organisation and his mother is a primary school teacher. Ashish also has a younger sister who is 29.\n\nWhen I ask him about marriage and becoming a parent himself, Ashish tells me he identifies as aromantic and asexual. “I have never experienced either a romantic or sexual attraction for any animal, vegetable or mineral,” he adds.\n\n“It’s incredibly fortunate because it imposes such vast costs on your emotions, time and money. So for me, it just frees up a lot of time and emotional bandwidth to deal with other things in life.”\n\nWill he regret this all one day?\n\nAlmost 100 per cent no, he states emphatically.\n\n“Let me put it this way. Everyone is working an ordinary job and living a conventional life, and I think they’re more likely to regret (their choices) compared to me. So it’s weird that people ask me this question but don’t ask everyone else the same thing.”\n\n“Everyone is working an ordinary job and living a conventional life, and I think they’re more likely to regret (their choices) compared to me.”\n\nAshish Kumar, a 32-year-old retiree (above)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/41b1476cb07fc1d3fa3aa7fa85b7e73515021285f33b5b5f508f64fe10dce832?w=825", "alt_text": "Former debater Ashish Kumar works around 10 hours a week as a debate coach for his old school and private enrichment centres."}]}

Seizing the opportunity, the thief stole the bag and fled to Kadiya village in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh’s Rajgarh district, where he disposed of the stolen jewellery before blending in with a crowd participating in the Kanwar Yatra, a religious pilgrimage.\n\nBut he was eventually tracked down by the police. It led to the exposure of his entire gang, who have been wreaking havoc in Kadiya.\n\nNDTV reported that the young thief received training in criminal activities in Kadiya which, along with two other remote villages in Madhya Pradesh – Gulkhedi and Hulkhedi – have gained notoriety as “nurseries” for criminals.\n\nSituated about 120km from the state capital Bhopal, these villages in Rajgarh district are known for training children in the “arts of theft, robbery and dacoity”, reported the publication.\n\nEven the police are known to tread carefully in this region.\n\nChildren as young as 12 are sent to these villages by their parents to be trained in criminal activities. The parents, after meeting with gang leaders, decide who can provide the best “education” for their child. To enroll in this grim curriculum, families pay a fee ranging from Rs2 lakh to Rs3 lakh.\n\nThe children are taught various criminal skills such as pickpocketing, snatching bags in crowded places, running fast, evading the police and enduring beatings if caught. After completing a year with a gang, the child’s parents receive an annual payment of Rs4 lakh from the gang leader.\n\nThese villages have produced some of the most cunning thieves, whose criminal activities have made headlines across India, reported NDTV.\n\nAdditional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Jaideep Prasad said in the Rajgarh district villages, criminals operate with impunity.\n\nHe said the criminals are so skilled that they can assess the value of jewellery without visiting a jeweler.\n\n“Most of the thefts are carried out by children, making it even more challenging to combat this deeply ingrained criminal culture,” said Inspector Ramkumar Bhagat.\n\nAccording to police officers, if an unfamiliar person enters the village, the residents immediately become alert, especially when they notice a camera or mobile phone.\n\nAccording to Inspector Bhagat, more than 300 children from these villages have been involved in thefts at wedding ceremonies across India.\n\n“These gangs are highly organised, conducting thorough recces before adopting innovative tactics to carry out their crimes,” he said. “Wealthy individuals also hire the poor children to commit thefts through a bidding process that can reach up to Rs20 lakh.”\n\nNDTV said the scale of this criminal operation is massive, with more than 2,000 people from these villages having over 8,000 cases registered against them in police stations across the country.\n\nA training class for criminals at a Rajgarh village.\n\nPhoto: Facebook", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8e5aa8afc5cdd48cfee880e5416d90086f6e7ca55aeabda20f22f617a0fd1afc?w=825", "alt_text": "A training class for criminals at a Rajgarh village."}]}

They are demanding that the management of hospitals and college campuses provide them with better facilities and security.\n\nThe crime has particularly horrified doctors because of where it occurred – in the hospital’s seminar room, where the victim was sleeping.\n\n“It could have been any of us,” Dr Radhika, who works at RG Kar, told AFP. “I was on night duty just two days before this incident. What she did is what any of us do – resting whenever, wherever we can.”\n\nThe murdered doctor – who has not been formally named but is being called “Abhaya” (fearless) by protesters – had gone to the seminar room for a break during a long shift. The details of what exactly happened after that is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. One man has been detained.\n\nDr Radhika said conditions such as long working hours – with barely any time to eat or rest – were not unusual for doctors in Indian hospitals.\n\nA key problem, she noted, is that very few hospitals had on-call rooms equipped with beds and other facilities to allow doctors on duty to rest. Thus, it was common for doctors to sleep in rooms meant for other activities.\n\nSafety and security measures are other issues that worry female doctors, especially when using the restroom.\n\n“When I was in college, we would not go to the restroom alone during night duty,” Dr Sangeetha Sivaraman, a doctor based in Bengaluru told online news site Scroll. “We would take someone along because it was often in an isolated area and we were scared.”\n\nAccording to philanthropic organisation Dasra, women make up nearly 30 per cent of doctors in India and 80 per cent of nursing staff. Attacks on female medical staff are all too common.\n\nOn Aug 20, the Supreme Court ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the Kolkata killing had “shocked the conscience of the nation”.\n\nThe court also highlighted a lack of CCTV cameras and a failure to screen visitors to hospitals for weapons.\n\nMedical superintendent Indira Kabade, who works at KC General Hospital in Bengaluru, said she worries about her staff getting home safely after work. “We never know if anyone is following them from the hospital,” she said.\n\nThough hospitals are usually equipped with CCTVs, they do not always install a sufficient number of them. In the Kolkata case, when police asked for relevant CCTV footage, the administration is reported to have said that there were no CCTVs installed in the seminar room because “many women change clothes there”.\n\nFoul sanitation – including often only one toilet for male and female medical staff – illustrates a failure by the authorities to provide basic infrastructure.\n\nThe situation is particularly worrying when the women are menstruating, Dr Radhika said.\n\nIn the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, doctor Rubeena Bhat said some medical staff would rather use washrooms in houses neighbouring the hospital. “It’s that bad,” she said.\n\nDoctors also observed that many hospitals did not have enough security personnel.\n\nPoor security can present a major problem to doctors when large crowds visit hospitals. “Anybody can enter,” said a female doctor in Chennai. “There is no control.”\n\nDoctors sometimes face physical violence and even sexual harassment from relatives and friends of patients – in some instances even through calls or messages. “People find the numbers from a register or somewhere else and then send inappropriate messages,” said Dr Radhika.\n\nSexual harassment also occurs within the hospital system itself. “Medical campuses and hospitals are highly hierarchical spaces and also inherently sexist,” said Dr Radhika. “Female doctors and nurses are exposed to sexual behaviour and harassment from male doctors and administrators. Nurses have it especially hard because of the power dynamics between doctors and nurses.”\n\nOne female doctor in Thiruvananthapuram, a city in Kerala, said she and her colleagues face abuse every day, from verbal insults to physical molestation. “There is no end to it,” she said.\n\n“Doctors are called gods or angels by some people,” the doctor said. “So we think we are immune to crimes. And when such a crime happens at a place which we consider the safest place, we are all afraid.”\n\n“Medical campuses and hospitals are highly hierarchical spaces and also inherently sexist.”\n\nDr Radhika, who works at RG Kar hospital in Kolkata", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c7eafd396fcc690561c6632cb32d8f5568f8347ee02a6ce467444b75f9e75a4a?w=825", "alt_text": "Medical professionals amid a nationwide strike to condemn the rape and murder of a young doctor at a hospital in Kolkata."}]}

The Cholas extended their kingdom into Sri Lanka and had trade routes to China through the Sumatra and Java peninsula.”\n\nThe dance ballet takes inspiration from the Prambanan, a 9th-century Hindu temple in Yogyakarta, southern Java.\n\n“In the Prambanan temple, we can see reliefs of many Hindu gods, demi-gods, apsaras, musical instruments and scenes from the Ramayana, especially sculptures of karanas of the 2nd century’s Natya Shastra. Our  dance ballet presents these karanas,” said Ramkumar.\n\nOn the north side of this temple stands a statue of Hindu goddess Durga. However, locals say it is Roro Jonggrang, a slender maiden and the heroine of a famous folklore. So, what’s the story of Roro? We present it in the dance ballet.”\n\nThe dance ballet, performed by eight Indonesian and eight Indian dancers, is an art fusion. Indonesian costumes are used for the Indian dances, and the Indian dances are in abinaya mode as it tells a story and is aimed at the common man.\n\nFeatured are also Javanese traditional dances such as tari pendet, tari serimpi, kecek and kuda kepang, which is a dying art.\n\nRamkumar, also an accomplished veena player, has composed seven songs sung by local singers and accompanied by flute, veena and mridangam.\n\nSriganesh has penned the Tamil songs, while Dr Sujatha Mohan from India and Swarna Varsha Gurumoorthy from Singapore have choreographed the Indian dances.\n\nV.K.

The music, featuring music producer Kalmi, is a mix of desi swagger and western – a hard-hitting explosion of punk rage and high energy drum beats.\n\n“A lot of things are happening in this video,” Hanumankind, 32, told Rolling Stone magazine. “But mainly, if you want something, take that risk, man, or else it won’t happen. Even if you fail, it’s still the act of doing.\n\n“For me, even if this video didn’t work out, I get to tell my grandchildren that I actually sat inside the Well of Death and did this. At the very least, if nothing worked out, I’m happy about that.”\n\nThe neat production work, directed by his frequent collaborator Bijoy Shetty, is matched by the gritty visuals shot by Abhinay Pandit. It is complete with slick editing work.\n\nWhat adds value to the entire production is Hanumankind’s performance, ever-present in the thick of the electrifying chaos – his goofy, grill-filled grin captivates as the camera swerves around him while he stomps and swaggers in the gritty arena.\n\n“We knew the song was going to do well, but we did not know it was going to be like this,” he told Rolling Stone. That has been surprising for sure.\n\n“I knew the video would have an impact though because we literally put our lives on the line.”\n\nHailing from Kerala, Sooraj’s journey has been anything but ordinary.\n\nBorn in Malappuram, a town in Kerala, his family moved across the globe, eventually landing in Houston, United States, where he spent his formative years.\n\nRaised by parents who valued a traditional path to success – education, a secure job and a settled life – Sooraj appeared to be on that exact track.\n\nAfter returning to India in 2012 to finish his degree, he found himself in the corporate world, working a stable job at Goldman Sachs by day. But by night, he was Hanumankind, an emerging rapper with a burning passion for music.\n\nHe went on to make his debut with EP Kalari and released the collaborative project Surface Level with Kalmi. They also released the single feature Rush Hour in 2022.\n\nNow based in Bengaluru, little did Hanumankind know that his after-hours hobby would soon become his main gig. A signing with Def Jam India turned his dreams into reality, and the release of Big Dawgs catapulted him to global fame.\n\n“I’m not a very religious person at all. I would say I’m spiritual. I do like what the name Hanuman implies when it comes to the Hindu deity because he personifies honour, courage and loyalty,” Hanumankind told Rolling Stone about his performer name. “He puts it all on his chest.\n\n“From this side of the world, Hanuman is a name that so many people know. Even if you don’t hold the same path, everyone has seen it or heard it or is aware of it. It’s something that everyone can associate with being Indian. And mankind is the rest of the world.

She reckons she knows who it is, though she was unable to see his face.\n\nSuspicions surface as stories unravel and truths raise their ugly heads.\n\nThe rest of the thriller unfolds at a dinner table where dirty laundry within the group is washed.

Jam Saheb is fondly remembered in Poland as Dobry Maharaja,” Mr Modi posted on X.\n\nNawanagar was an Indian princely state located on the southern shores of the Gulf of Kutch. It was ruled by the Jadeja Rajput dynasty and became a part of India after independence in 1947. Its capital city was Nawanagar city, which is now known as Jamnagar.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a post on X: “The story of the ‘Dobry (Good) Maharaja’ is one of the most evocative chapters in the relations between India and Poland. This moving tribute to the compassion of the Maharaja continues to have a lasting impact on India-Poland ties.”\n\nThe memorial – a small brick pillar with inscriptions – was unveiled in October 2014 at the Square of the Good Maharaja in Warsaw’s Ochota district.\n\nAccording to the Indian embassy, eight Polish primary and secondary schools are named after the Jam Saheb.\n\nIn 1942, the maharaja provided refuge to about 1,000 children from camps following the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and Russia. The surviving Polish children have formed an Association of Poles, which meets annually in one of the major Polish cities.\n\nLater, PM Modi also visited the Kolhapur Memorial in Warsaw which was inaugurated in November 2017.\n\n“This memorial is a tribute to the great royal family of Kolhapur. This royal family was at the forefront of giving shelter to Polish women and children displaced due to the horrors of World War II,” he said in another post on X.\n\n“Inspired by the ideals of (Indian ruler and member of the Bhonsle dynasty) Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the great royal family of Kolhapur put humanity above everything else and ensured a life of dignity for the Polish women and children. This act of compassion will keep inspiring generations.”\n\nMore than 5,000 Poles had lived, integrated and worked for several years at Valivade village, near Kolhapur, before returning home. Most of them had arrived after evacuations from Polish camps at the height of World War II.\n\nAfter Mr Modi visited the Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino, the MEA said in a post on X: “PM honoured the brave soldiers who fought in World War II. Indian and Polish troops fought side by side in this historic battle (that took place in Italy). Our shared history and enduring ties continue to inspire.”\n\nMr Modi’s visit to Poland is the first by an Indian prime minister in 45 years. He will visit Kyiv today, a first visit to Ukraine by an Indian prime minister since diplomatic relations were established 30 years ago, reported Reuters.\n\nMr Modi said on Wednesday that he will “share perspectives” on the peaceful resolution of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia during his visit.\n\n“As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6bf4813edfa4bf290ee654ec08ff990e886da2b163b474701e86b7ea55ecdfd4?w=825", "alt_text": "PM Modi lays a wreath at the memorial of Jam Saheb of Nawanagar in Poland."}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/lifestyle/sports-fitness/give-mum-and-dad-medal-too", "site_title": "Give that mum and dad a medal too", "publish_date": null, "content": "Lifestyle\n\nGive that mum and dad a medal too\n\nUPDATED\n\nAug 15, 2024, 6:55 PM\n\nSingaporean kitefoiler Maximilian Maeder with his father Valentin and mother Hwee Keng.\n\nBerita Harian\n\nAli Kasim\n\nI couldn’t have been more than six years old when my dad bowled a red Kookaburra ball at me at what seemed like an alarming pace.\n\nWe were at the batting cages at the far end of the Padang at the Singapore Cricket Club. My dad, a former national cricketer, was a member of the establishment and found it fitting one Sunday to leave his bar stool and drag me down to the massive field and get me hooked on the sport.\n\nHis intentions – and my swing of the cricket bat – missed by considerable measure.\n\nThe heavy hard ball struck my shin instead, causing me to drop the bat and scream in agony. I decided then and there that I wanted nothing more to do with cricket. Till today, I have never picked up the bat again.\n\nOne wonders what might have been had Singapore kitefoiler and Olympic medallist Maximilian Maeder experienced a similar first-time experience when his dad Valentin first taught him how to sail. What if he had fallen off his board? What if he had hurt himself?\n\nTruth is, all that probably happened – countless times. And Max duly picked himself up and got better and better.\n\nHis dad Valentin would have encouraged him every step of the way.\n\nSo while we celebrate Max’s achievements at the Paris Olympics, where the 17-year-old won bronze in the men’s kitefoiling event, let’s also send kudos to his parents Valentin and Hwee Keng, who deserve a salute for raising a champion.\n\nKiteboarders themselves, the Swiss and Singaporean couple introduced Max – and his two younger siblings – to kiteboarding when he was six. He picked up kitefoiling two years later.\n\nBy the time he was 11, Max was on the professional circuit, racing against adults. Today, he has six world youth titles and two senior world titles in his trophy case.\n\nThere are no shortcuts to nurturing a sailing champion, says Ben Tan, a former national sailor and Olympian.\n\nIn his op-ed for CNA, Tan, who has known Max since the latter began sailing, wrote that the teen’s formative years spent at the Wakatobi Dive Resort on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi undoubtedly had a big role in his progress. The resort was built and is run by Valentin and Hwee Keng.\n\nMax’s upbringing was also crucial – even as the Maeders’ parenting style might be counterintuitive to some. “Homeschooling was a natural decision for the Maeders, and so was racing (sometimes unaccompanied) on the professional circuit among adults,” Tan wrote.\n\nIndeed, there are many ways to groom a champion. But some tenets must persist. Like how parents should ensure their kids are playing the sport because they enjoy it, and not because they see you enjoying it.\n\nThen there’s the maxim that “the car ride home is the most important part”.\n\nMax, it seems, talks to his father daily, even when he is racing somewhere in Europe while his father is in remote Wakatobi.\n\nWhen asked about their relationship, Max said he looks to his dad for advice and that his father provides a safe space. Even during the Olympics, those daily chats served as pre-race “framing” sessions and post-race debriefs. Crucially, Valentin acts as a sounding board and does not tell Max what to do.\n\nThen there’s teaching your kid how to lose well – a trait the well-spoken and graceful Max exemplified after winning bronze in Paris. He hugged his opponents and wasted no time in paying tribute to both the gold- and silver-medalists.\n\nForeign journalists have also been won over. After a seven-minute interview in German – Max speaks multiple languages – his interviewer remarked to Singaporean journalists how the teenager’s poise was of somebody far beyond his tender age.\n\nEven President Tharman Shanmugaratnam weighed in. “Max is mature beyond his years – his teenage smile and traces of puppy fat are deceptive. There is a new wind in Singapore sports,” he wrote in a social media post.\n\nBefore Max’s feats in Paris, some quarters couldn’t resist but draw comparisons with him and swimmer Joseph Schooling – Singapore’s gold medallist from 2016.\n\nUnderstandable, seeing that they’re both Eurasian, talented and personable.\n\nThere’s a salient similarity among their parents too. Much like Valentin and Hwee Keng, Colin and May Schooling made countless sacrifices and ultimately took a leap of faith amid a conservative Singapore sporting culture to groom a successful athlete overseas.\n\nIn a way, parents deserve medals too.\n\nInstead, they must be content with simply living vicariously through their child’s success.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3c0c7756ce5195d48aba282cf710e8c2160db360ac2047c160d2c4a5bd4b330b?w=825", "alt_text": "Singaporean kitefoiler Maximilian Maeder with his father Valentin and mother Hwee Keng."}]}

Since then, she won’t eat the food I give her unless I step away,” Ms Thara explains. “If I get too close, she will hiss and make a scene.”\n\nBut the “bad blood” doesn’t faze Ms Thara; she continues going up to the second floor of the block, where the black cat loiters, and feeds her while watching from a safe distance.\n\n“When I moved into this neighbourhood, I used to see a frail, elderly woman feed these cats,” said Ms Thara. “When she passed on, the cats would continue to gather every morning, hungry and waiting for food.”\n\nMoved by this, Ms Thara, who works in a casino as a jackpot executive, stepped in to carry on this labour of love, spending around $300 a month on cat food – not counting the costs of veterinary visits and sterilisation.\n\nHer five-room flat has been transformed into a sanctuary for some 17 cats, many of which she fosters while finding them permanent homes.\n\n“The commitment never gets easier. You need to show up for the cats every day. Cat feeders often face angry passers-by and encounter abusive or neglectful owners. Despite these challenges, giving up is not an option,” she said, adding that she has already begun to guide younger volunteers in feeding the cats.\n\nMr Panneerselvam, who has two cats as pets, said he feeds the community cats because he cannot bear the thought of them going hungry.\n\nHe, like Ms Thara, was unwilling to disclose his exact location, in order to protect the cats.\n\nThe 46-year-old has been feeding his neighbourhood cats every evening for the past 24 years, and said he often witnesses cat abuse by his fellow residents. Many, he said, hastily adopt cats without meshing their homes, leading to them falling from high floors.\n\nAccording to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), six to eight cats fall from height every week, and around half that number do not survive the fall.\n\nMr Paneerselvam recalls the guilt he felt when he failed to recognise how one of the cats he cared for around a decade ago was ill – a mistake that cost the cat its life.\n\n“The cat seemed tired all the time, but I didn’t realise the skin around its hip had gotten infected. By the time I noticed and took it to the vet, the skin tissue had started to rot and they could not save the cat,” he said.\n\nBeyond feeding them, he now ensures the cats in his estate get medical care when necessary, even if it comes at a significant cost to him.\n\nHe pointed out that feeding stray cats in residential areas is not illegal, but the feeders are required to clean up the area within two hours to avoid littering.\n\nFor telemarketer Srerathi Chandrabose, feeding cats is a form of therapy.\n\nHaving struggled with depression and diabetes for over a decade, the 42-year-old spends over a fifth of her monthly income on cat food.\n\n“Cat feeding gives me so much purpose in life. It is tough showing up for myself at times, but I know I need to show up for these cats every day. That keeps me going,” she said.\n\nAccording to market research firm Euromonitor International, Singapore is home to an estimated 50,000 stray cats, a population that significantly outnumbers volunteer caregivers.\n\nMs Srerathi said that many cat feeders are low-income individuals like herself, or elderly, who struggle to keep up with the demands of volunteering.\n\n“We need more support not just in terms of cash but also time. We need more youth to step in to volunteer as well, maybe take over one day,” she said.\n\n“In my neighbourhood, there’s always some construction or renovation going on, which worries me. Where will the cats go? And when there are new roads and junctions, they are often not used to them and get seriously injured,” she adds.\n\nAt the cemeteries, the issue of neglected and hungry cats and dogs is manifold, said Ms Mumtaz Begum Aziz.\n\nBefore her father’s death in 2009, the 47-year-old was unaware of strays living in cemetery compounds. Now, she and a friend feed the animals either home-cooked or bought meals almost every night.\n\n“The cemetery is home to about 50 cats and dogs, but they are often overlooked. Despite being a Muslim, I believe in feeding even dogs and providing them with care and love,” Ms Mumtaz said.\n\n“Many people think strays don’t need to be fed. But these animals don’t get enough nutrition. We volunteers also regularly identify cats for sterilisation, which effectively and humanely controls their population.”\n\nAs part of its efforts to support such volunteers and raise awareness on stray cats, the Cat Welfare Society (CWS) established a cat caregiving programme in Boon Lay in November 2023.\n\nSince then, the neighbourhood has seen a reduction in abandonment cases and errant feeding.\n\n“Cat abuse, neglect and hoarding are symptoms of deeper fundamental social issues,” said CWS president Thenuga Vijakumar. The organisation thus reaches out to cat owners and caregivers through their monthly door-to-door visits in selected neighbourhoods.\n\nThis year, after years of advocacy by CWS, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and other animal welfare groups, the 34-year ban on cat ownership in HDB flats was lifted.\n\nAlthough not strictly enforced, it was previously illegal to house cats in HDB flats since 1989 due to the supposed inconvenience they may cause neighbours. Now, up to two cats may be housed in a flat. Additional pet licences are subject to approval by HDB and the Animal & Veterinary Service.\n\nMs Thenuga said that for many, the Covid-19 period marked their first real encounters with community cats in the neighbourhood. At the same time, there were some residents who viewed the animals as nuisances, and proposed to the town councils for the cats to be removed from the area.\n\nIn her view, these actions signal a critical issue of awareness and tolerance to co-exist.\n\n“We’re counting on more people to help break these misconceptions and join us to support the cause to strengthen community cat welfare,” said Ms Thenuga.\n\n“After all, they are as much a part of our society as we are.”\n\nMs Srerathi Chandrabose said many cat feeders are low-income individuals who struggle to keep up with the demands of volunteering.\n\nMs Thara Jeyaraman, with a suitcase full of cat food, watching over a cat that she once helped sterilise, and which, according to her, hasn’t forgiven her.\n\nMr Chandramoorthy Krishnamoorthy, along with Ms Mumtaz Begum Aziz, feed about 50 cats and dogs at a cemetery every evening.\n\nPhotos: T.

His most recent win against the Indian was at the Tata Steel Chess tournament last January.\n\nIn St Louis, Ding had a chance to make life difficult for Gukesh, but he hesitated and the Indian escaped unscathed.\n\n“I wanted to surprise him in the opening but also save my preparation,” Ding said after the game with Gukesh.\n\n“I’m playing better now than I was in the beginning of the year. I played many training games and although I lost many of them, I learnt a lot from my losses.”\n\n“Just as the game of chess is renowned for its depth and ingenuity, RWS presents a diverse range of offerings with something for everyone.”\n\nRWS president \nLee Shi Ruh", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ee4562e188a529dd37a8a954f111a85dd791299caabd4869e24ebffd5163dd12?w=825", "alt_text": "Ding Liren played Gukesh Dommaraju in Round 1 of the Sinquefield Cup in St Louis, United States, on Aug 20."}]}

The court will decide whether he remains in custody or is granted bail.”\n\nIndia Today reported that a team of forest officials visited his village and detained him under the Wildlife Protection Act.\n\nA sample of meat, purported to be chicken curry, found in his house has been sent for forensic analysis.\n\nInvestigators are also probing how Kumar obtained the peacock featured in the video, which has since been removed from his channel.\n\nThe Times of India said Kumar’s peacock curry video was “a stunt allegedly pulled to attract more views”.\n\n“However, his response was far from what he might have anticipated,” it said. “Social media users condemned the video, accusing Kumar of promoting illegal wildlife consumption and disrespecting a national symbol.”\n\nKumar’s YouTube channel has 277,000 subscribers. He typically garners 1,000 views on his recipe videos.\n\nThe Indian peacock is distinguished by its vibrant blue plumage and the impressive wingspan of the males. The bird holds historical significance, with the Mughal dynasty’s throne, known as the Peacock Throne, named for its ornate depiction of peacocks.\n\nIn recent decades, rapid urbanisation and habitat loss have led to a significant decline in the peacock population in the wild. India’s wildlife laws now impose severe penalties and fines to protect these birds from hunting or harm.\n\nThe Indian peafowl, the animal group that includes the male peacock, enjoys one of the highest levels of protection under the law as the national bird. The hunting, killing or capturing of the bird is strictly prohibited, and those found in violation face imprisonment for a minimum term of three years, up to a maximum of seven years, along with a fine.\n\nThis is not the first instance of individuals being apprehended for consuming peacock meat.\n\nIn June, two farmers from Telangana’s Vikarabad district were arrested for allegedly eating a peacock. Forest officials alerted authorities after discovering peacock feathers in an open field with the bird’s body missing. The peacock was believed to have died of electrocution before the two farmers took it away.\n\nSP Mahajan has assured the public that “strictest action would be taken” against Kumar and anyone else involved in such illegal activities.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/095a904adaebaebe08520c9b6e08f50a054e386fc48344b9f320359c79596a07?w=825", "alt_text": "YouTuber Pranay Kumar was detained by police on Monday after cooking and eating a peacock."}]}

It is comprised of moves that include complex footwork, flips and twists.\n\nAfter a successful run at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, breaking was added to the Olympic programme in Paris. But it stirred controversy, especially the performance by Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn.\n\nCompeting under the name Raygun, she went viral online after her performance in the round-robin stage of the women’s competition, where she was swept out without earning a single point.\n\nThe 36-year-old sparked dozens of memes and drew criticism from viewers for her unconventional moves.\n\nWearing a tracksuit in Australia’s green and gold, her moves included hopping like a kangaroo and dancing like a child.\n\nA man posted on X: “(It was like) my dog on the lawn 30 seconds after bathing him.”\n\nCritics also said Raygun’s performance didn’t represent breaking, which originated in the Bronx in the 1970s.\n\nMalik Dixon, an African American man who lives in Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Gunn came off as “somebody who was toying with the culture” during a significant moment for the sport.\n\nWhile Gunn defended her moves, not many were impressed with breaking. Many felt it is more dancing and not really a sport.\n\nDozens of sports have been added, removed and sometimes re-added to the Olympics. Polo, golf, karate, tandem cycling, tug-of-war, tumbling and rope climbing were all previously summer Olympic sports.\n\n“The Olympics are constantly evolving, it’s trial and error,” Bob Barney, professor emeritus at the University of Western Ontario and an Olympic historian, told NBC Insider. “The International Olympic Committee will try something and if it works, great. If it doesn’t, well, back to the drawing board.”\n\nSo far, the sports added to the 2028 Olympics are flag football, lacrosse, cricket, squash, baseball and softball.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/72ad34fb375e6e6e13dd08060b897c66e2c81d9eca739ea73822e6ab332554eb?w=825", "alt_text": "Raygun of Australia during the breaking competition at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games."}]}

Rahman will perform at the National Stadium on Aug 31.\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nA.R. Rahman brought nostalgia to a crowd of abut 35,000 at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil on July 27, delivering a high-energy performance that showcased his memorable 1990s hits.\n\nThe Indian music legend’s live concert at the National Stadium in Singapore on Aug 31 is expected to be similarly entertaining, as it will showcase an extensive repertoire of songs, including his greatest hits in Tamil, Hindi and other languages, as well as his latest creations.\n\nThere will be numbers such as Kannalane (from the film Bombay), Athangara Marame (Kizhakku Cheemayile), Ponni Nadhi (PS1), Athiradee (Sivaji: The Boss), Chiku Buku Raile (Gentleman), Tu Hi Re (Uyire), Jai Ho (Slumdog Milllionaire), Param Sundari (Mimi), Chaiyya Chaiyya (Dil Se) and Tere Bina (Guru).\n\n“It will be three hours of pure world-class entertainment from 6.30pm,” organiser Maestro Productions Global chairman Parthiban Murugaiyan told tabla!  “His music is universal and everybody will be able to enjoy it. Ticket sales have been good and we expect about 30,000 spectators.”\n\nFondly known as the “Mozart of Madras”, Rahman has won two Oscars, two Grammys, a Golden Globe, a Bafta and six National Awards. The 58-year-old is noted for his versatility in combining Western classical, Carnatic, Tamil traditional, folk, jazz, reggae and rock music into his compositions.\n\nRahman’s oeuvre has famously transcended Tamil, Hindi and Telugu films, and made a mark in Hollywood, the West End and Broadway.\n\nHe told The Straits Times that just like at his Kuala Lumpur concert, his 21-year-old son A.R. Ameen will be one of the singers performing in Singapore.\n\n“I think the borders are all blurring and it’s the right time. I invite all the people who know and listen to my music – Singaporeans, Chinese people, Indian people, Hindi people, Tamil people – to come and celebrate it at the concert and enjoy themselves,” he said.\n\nSingapore has always been special to Rahman, as it was the first country that he travelled to out of India.\n\nHe will be the first Indian musician to perform live at the National Stadium.\n\nMaestro, who organised singer Anirudh’s concert at the Indoor Stadium in March 2023 that featured a 360-degree stage, is pulling out all the stops to make Rahman’s show a grand affair.\n\n“The stage, lighting, LED displays, sound system, everything is going to be of the highest standard as far as Indian music shows in Singapore are concerned,” said Mr Parthiban. “It will be on a par with the big shows we have seen at the National Stadium in recent months.”\n\nAccording to him, more than 100 people will be flying in with Rahman from India for the show, including back-up singers, dancers and technical crew.\n\n“The dancers are said to be spectacular,” he said. “We are giving special emphasis to the technical aspects as we do not want anything to go wrong.”\n\nIt will be Rahman’s fourth concert in Singapore. His previous one in April 2014 at Gardens by the Bay was marred by technical glitches and a blackout.\n\nTo ensure everything goes right, Maestro is partnering with event management company UnUsUal Entertainment, which has experience in delivering big musical shows at the National Stadium.\n\n“We are only four years old; on the other hand, UnUsUal is vastly experienced in this field,” said Mr Parthiban. “They do concerts all over the world and have done a lot of Western, K-pop and big-name concerts in Singapore. Ours is a very good synergy as we have the strength of knowing what the Indian community wants.”\n\nGates for the Rahman concert will open at 4.30pm, followed by a 30-minute pre-show.\n\nThere will be no standing, with seating separated by two sections: arena and floor.\n\n“All the seats are placed in such a way that everyone will have a good view of the stage,” said Mr Parthiban. “Our ticket pricing has also been reasonable, as we want as many as possible to enjoy the show.”\n\nTickets for the concert range between $398 (VIP) and $148.\n\nEntrepreneur Periyannan Muthukarruan, 42, who plans to attend the Rahman concert with a group of friends, said that ticket pricing for such shows is subjective.\n\n“Some might consider the pricing steep, but if you are a diehard A.R. Rahman fan, it’s worth it.”\n\nPhoto: Maestro Productions Global\n\n“I invite all the people who know and listen to my music – Singaporeans, Chinese people, Indian people, Hindi people, Tamil people – to come and celebrate it at the concert and enjoy themselves.”\n\nMulti-award winning Indian composer and singer A.R.

Rahman’s daughter Khatija has revealed that she is not totally influenced by her father’s style.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who made her debut as a music director with the Tamil film Minmini which hit the screens on Aug 9, believes in rich orchestration for her songs. But she also listens to a lot of international soundtracks.\n\n“I have listened to a lot of his songs, watched his films and noted the background score and compositions,” she told the Hindustan Times. “But I also listen to a lot of international soundtracks and music from Hollywood. I am going for music classes even now – my teacher is in the US and she is a composer herself.”\n\nAlready an established vocalist, Khatija made her debut as a singer with the song “Puthiya Manidha”, composed by her father, for director S. Shankar’s Rajinikanth-starrer Enthiran (2010).\n\nHer family is deeply rooted in music and the performing arts: Brother A.R. Ameen is a playback singer, cousin G.V. Prakash Kumar a composer and actor, aunt Reihana a playback singer and composer, and relative Rashin Rahman an actor. Her grandfather and Rahman’s father R.K.

Khatija acknowledged that such perceptions are natural.\n\n“There is nothing wrong if anyone says this because that’s the first thing people will notice about me,” she said. “But now that Minmini has been released, people have genuinely appreciated my work. They realise I am hardworking. They all know I am not taking it lightly and that’s my goal.”\n\nRahman told India Today that Khatija’s work in Minmini was “very good”.\n\n“I’m not telling this because I’m her father.

The men added that she will have to remain under surveillance until she is cleared of any offence. Otherwise, she would be arrested.\n\nMs Puri, who is from Punjab and lives on the IIT campus in Jodhpur, a city in Rajasthan, told police that she received several calls from different numbers on Aug 1.\n\n“When I took the call, the caller introduced himself as a policeman,” she said. “He told me that drugs have been found in a parcel sent to me. It also had many passports and credit cards.\n\n“He told me to report the incident to the Mumbai Cyber ​​Crime Branch and himself transferred the call to the department.”\n\n“There, a person introduced himself as the deputy commissioner of police and said: ‘You are trapped in a money laundering case. So you have to cooperate, otherwise you will be arrested and sent to jail.’ I got scared and kept doing whatever those people told me to do.”\n\nAccording to police, the scammers kept the assistant professor under constant surveillance. Police did not, however, explain why the process of procuring her personal and banking details was drawn out for so many days.\n\n“The cyber criminals took control of her mobile phone, kept the camera on and shared the screen. Her laptop was also brought under control through the Skype app, a police officer told NDTV. “The professor could not even contact anyone.\n\n“They intimidated her and made her transfer money to them, telling her she would be let free if she does so.”\n\nMs Puri, who was placed under surveillance from Aug 1, gave her bank details to the criminals nine days later.\n\nThe gang then transferred around Rs12 lakh from her Yes Bank account through Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).\n\nRGTS is a system that allows for continuous and real-time settlement of fund transfers on a transaction-by-transaction basis.\n\nSoon after the money was transferred, the gang freed Ms Puri from “digital arrest”.\n\nLater, the assistant professor realised she had been duped, and informed the police.\n\nSub-Inspector Mahendra Kumar told NDTV that police are trying to find out which account the money was transferred to and how the gang managed to pocket it.\n\nThis incident comes in the wake of a group of scammers posing as CBI officers targeting a Lucknow writer-poet on July 7.\n\nThey kept him under digital arrest for six hours, until a relative suspected foul play and called the police.\n\n“The cyber criminals took control of her mobile phone, kept the camera on and shared the screen.

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/community/opinion/coconut-or-not-coconut", "site_title": "To coconut or not to coconut...", "publish_date": null, "content": "Community\n\nTo coconut or not to coconut...\n\nUPDATED\n\nAug 15, 2024, 6:52 PM\n\nDaisy Irani\n\nIt was a typical Sunday afternoon in Singapore, and the house was filled with the tantalising aroma of spices.\n\nThe kitchen, usually a sanctuary for peace and creativity, had turned into a battlefield. On one side stood Manjeet Singh, a proud Punjabi man from Delhi with arms folded, eyebrows furrowed and an expression that could curdle milk. On the other, with a coconut in hand like a ball of fire, was Meenakshi Nair, a fiery Malayali who had made Singapore her home.\n\nThe bone of contention? Curry. Specifically, whether or not to add coconut to it.\n\nManjeet was adamant. “Listen, Meenakshi, curry is supposed to be rich, spicy and full of flavor. We use ghee, yogurt, cream – anything that adds that robust taste! Coconut will just water it down. It’s like asking a lion to purr!”\n\nMeenakshi rolled her eyes as she twirled her coconut. “Manjeet, you Punjabis think that all curries should just burn your tongue off! Coconut adds a smooth, creamy texture that balances the spices perfectly. It’s like a symphony in your mouth, not a rock concert!”\n\nThe debate had begun.\n\nRound One: \nThe ingredients showdown\n\nManjeet decided to make his first move. “In the North, we use whole spices like cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. The curry is slow-cooked until the meat or vegetables absorb all that rich flavour. And let’s not forget the kasuri methi, a secret weapon for that authentic Punjabi taste. The result is a curry so rich and hearty, it can stand on its own.”\n\nMeenakshi smirked, not one to back down. “Oh, we have our secrets too! In Kerala, the curry starts with freshly grated coconut and curry leaves, mixed with a blend of spices that you North Indians wouldn’t even know how to pronounce! Ever heard of kokum or kudampuli? I didn’t think so. And our curries aren’t just about heat; they’re about layers of flavour that evolve with each bite.”\n\nManjeet looked skeptical. “So, you’re telling me your coconut concoction can compete with a proper butter chicken? Or a rich, creamy dal makhani?”\n\nMeenakshi raised an eyebrow. “Butter chicken? That’s just dessert with a hint of spice! Try our ishtu – an aromatic coconut milk-based stew with vegetables or meat, or the famous Kerala fish curry. They’re dishes with depth, not just a slap of ghee and cream!”\n\nRound Two: \nThe health argument\n\nManjeet, realising that taste alone might not win this battle, decided to pivot to health. “All right, let’s talk health. Do you know how much fat is in coconut milk? My arteries are hardening just thinking about it. And what about cholesterol?”\n\nMeenakshi was ready. “Ah, typical North Indian thinking! You drown everything in ghee and butter and then worry about cholesterol? Coconut is actually quite healthy. It’s rich in lauric acid, which can boost immunity, and it’s full of healthy fats that can lower cholesterol. Plus, it’s completely plant-based, so it’s vegan-friendly. How’s that for modern living?”\n\nManjeet scoffed. “Vegan, schmegan! I want flavour, not a health lecture. And what about your coconut oil? You fry everything in it. Isn’t that bad for your heart?”\n\nMeenakshi shot back, “Not all frying is bad, Manjeet. Coconut oil has a high smoke point, which means it’s more stable at high temperatures. Plus, it’s been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. Can your refined vegetable oil say the same?”\n\nRound Three: \nThe cultural connection\n\nThe debate was reaching boiling point. Manjeet, sensing the argument was slipping from his grasp, went for the emotional kill. “But Meenakshi, what about tradition? My grandmother made curry the way her grandmother made it, without any coconut! It’s our heritage, our identity.”\n\nMeenakshi softened, just for a moment. “I understand, Manjeet. But tradition isn’t just about following a recipe; it’s about adapting to where we are. In Kerala, coconuts are everywhere, so they became a part of our tradition. Here in Singapore, we have access to all kinds of ingredients, so why not combine the best of both worlds?”\n\nManjeet thought about this for a second. He could imagine his grandmother stirring a pot of curry on a cold Delhi winter’s day, and he could see the pride in her eyes. But he also remembered the first time he tasted a Malayali fish curry in Singapore, with its tangy, spicy, coconut-infused sauce that felt like a warm hug on a rainy day.\n\nThe Final Verdict\n\nIn the end, the debate ended the way most great debates do – with a compromise.\n\n“Maybe we could try a fusion?” Manjeet suggested cautiously. “A curry that combines the richness of Punjabi spices with the smoothness of coconut milk?”\n\nMeenakshi smiled. “Now you’re talking! We could even throw in some kasuri methi and curry leaves. It could be the best of both worlds.”\n\nAnd so, the two unlikely friends set out to create a new dish, a symbol of the rich tapestry of cultures that make up the Indian diaspora in Singapore. It was a curry that neither had tasted before, but both agreed it was delicious.\n\nIn the end, whether to coconut or not to coconut wasn’t the question. The real question was how to embrace the diversity of flavours and traditions that define who we are, wherever we may be. And that, my friends, is a recipe worth savouring.\n\nDaisy Irani Subaiah is a media and theatre professional with work experience in Singapore and India.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/753605adb1e8693a90c99146fc96dca9294e05dc45a142315bb863f750e06621?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

But on a random Tuesday last week, it was a charcoal-baked naan shop with green signage that caught most people’s attention.\n\nKnown for its fluffy, crispy naans, butter chicken and grilled-to-order seekh kebab, Delhi Lahori, an Indian-Pakistani food stall, has just been added to the list of 81 Singapore eateries on the 2024 Bib Gourmand List.\n\nReleased in June by the Michelin Guide Singapore, the Bib Gourmand distinction, symbolised by the “Bibendum” or “Michelin Man”, recognises both restaurants and street food eateries that Michelin inspectors deem to offer the best value for money.\n\nIn total, there are 283 locations listed on the eighth edition of the guide: 51 starred restaurants, 81 Bib Gourmand eateries and 151 Michelin Selected venues.\n\nThere are currently four Indian eateries on the Bib Gourmand list: Anglo Indian, Muthu’s Curry, Lagnaa and Delhi Lahori – the only hawker outlet among the quartet.\n\nEventually, after 20 or so minutes of waiting, a table opens up in front of the stall, where shop owner Naseer Ahmed Khan stands in front of a glass showcase of aloo gobi, bindi masala and tandoori chicken thighs.\n\nOptions are aplenty, but it is Mr Naseer’s butter chicken and seekh kebab that are most revered – according to reviews online at least – and so I order both, along with a garlic naan.\n\nI’m told the waiting time is about 10 minutes, and Mr Naseer explains that the stall makes the naan and kebabs fresh upon order. “Usually it takes 7-10 minutes. For the fish tikka and seekh kebab, even if we’re very busy, we always prepare it fresh,” he says.\n\nSitting down for a conversation, the 47-year-old tells me he was surprised to hear his shop was included on the Michelin list.\n\n“It’s wonderful to know that an ordinary hawker stall can be included on such a list,” he says, adding that since the award, business has spiked 10-15 per cent.\n\n“I used to work in hotels, as a sous chef, with Michelin-starred chefs so I knew about the stars and all that. But I’ve never heard of Indian hawker stalls getting such recognition.\n\n“Even until now, people have been coming and congratulating us. It’s really very nice.”\n\nA permanent resident who hails from Lahore in Pakistan, Mr Naseer has worked at various Indian restaurants in Singapore since 2000. He opened Delhi Lahori in 2018 at International Business Park in Jurong. The stall relocated to Tekka, where the monthly rent is $3,700, in 2020.\n\nThe newfound fame has attracted various clientele to the Tekka outlet, including other Michelin-starred chefs.\n\n“The chef from (now-defunct) Song of India, Manjunath Mural, has come here many times. He likes the food,” says Mr Naseer. Incidentally, Mr Manjunath once led The Song of India to a Michelin Star for three consecutive years.\n\nWhen the food arrived, the soft, pillowy naan was too hot to tear – it had just surfaced from the depths of the conspicuous clay oven located in the modest-sized stall. Think of the aroma of freshly baked bread infused with garlic; this was surely an item you needed to eat on the spot.\n\nThe butter chicken was not too heavy – almost like a deliciously spiced tomato soup with chunks of barbequed chicken that gave the dish a smoky undertone.\n\nThe star of the meal, though, were the two pieces of lamb seekh kebab. So tender that you could barely pick it up with a fork, the kebabs were served without any mint chutney – because it simply wasn’t needed.\n\n“We don’t want to sacrifice our authenticity,” says Mr Naseer. “That’s why we cook using charcoal and a clay oven. Otherwise, the true flavour of the seekh kebab won’t be there.”\n\nI tell Mr Naseer I’m curious about the name of his stall. “Why Delhi and Lahori? Those two cities aren’t really on the best of terms, you know,” I say in jest.\n\n“Singapore is a multiracial country, so if we put only a Pakistani or Indian name, it’s not catering to everyone,” says Mr Naseer, who lives here with his wife and five children.\n\n“So the name is to attract both groups of people. Food-wise, the cuisines are almost the same.”\n\nA pillowy naan being made at Delhi Lahori.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nGarlic naan from Delhi Lahori.\n\nT.

At first, I didn’t believe it but then the messages started flooding in,” he said.\n\n“It was something that could have been prevented, but at that point in time, I guess no one saw the signs. Or they saw them but were not ‘mental-health literate’ enough to provide the necessary support.”\n\nSoon after that moment, Mr Devan, now 32, devoted himself to the issue of mental health among youth. He took up training in suicide prevention and started providing pro-bono suicide support.\n\n“I encouraged friends to pass my number to anyone who they knew was suicidal. People would call me up and I would be a support system for them – a friend who would hold space for them.”\n\nAmid this, he himself was diagnosed with depression and had his own suicidal ideations: “I was going through my own journey of trying to understand where I belonged in the community as a person with a mental health condition.”\n\nA 4am phone conversation with a suicidal youth opened Mr Devan’s eyes to gaps in the mental health support structure in Singapore. The youth cried: “Why aren’t there more people like you… or an agency that caters to mental health in the South Asian community?”\n\nIn 2017, together with his then-girlfriend Priyahnisha Noorulla, a psychotherapist who is now his wife, Mr Devan started Mental ACT, a non-profit organization that provides mental health support to the South Asian community in Singapore.\n\nHis moving story of how he helped others while battling his own depression will feature in one of three short films – titled Care And Compassion –  to be screened at this year’s National Day Parade.\n\nThe film highlights stories of ordinary people going above and beyond to serve the community, encasing the Singapore spirit of togetherness.\n\nAmong the seven Singaporeans featured in the short film are the Straits Times’ Singaporean of the Year 2023 award winners Ronita Paul, 72, and Geraldine Lee, 66.\n\nIn 2011, they founded Arc Children’s Centre, Singapore’s first daycare centre for children battling cancer and other critical illnesses. It was a centre born out of a promise Ms Paul made to a 14-year-old cancer-stricken boy more than 15 years ago.\n\nMs Paul and Ms Lee had been serving at Assisi Hospice as a nurse and volunteer coordinator respectively when they first met the boy Raphael.\n\nMs Paul recalls: “He came to the hospice in a lot of pain and anger as his whole world had crashed. He would throw things at nurses.”\n\nMs Paul herself was confronted with a flying box of tissues when she first met him. Yet, as she got to know the boy and his underlying kindness, they soon became friends.\n\nOn his 14th birthday, Ms Paul took him to an adult day centre for people with cancer. He asked Ms Paul: “Why isn’t there a place for children like me?”\n\n“I told him okay, we will do it,” Ms Paul said.\n\nUnfortunately, Raphael died a few months later and the idea lay dormant for many years due to a lack of knowhow.\n\nBut with the help of Ms Lee and a few others, Arc Children’s Centre was soon established. Today, the centre caters to 25-40 kids a day.\n\nThe children are already excited to see the duo onscreen on National Day. Ms Lee said: “They caught a glimpse of us on the NDP 2024 theme video and came running to us screaming “We saw you!”\n\nYet, featuring in the short film is about more than just recognition; it is about awareness.\n\nTo Mr Devan, it means we are one step closer to a day where Mental ACT “is no longer relevant, because the community is empathetic and knowledgeable”, and where people can get the necessary intervention.\n\nTo Ms Paul and Ms Lee, getting the word out means they can impact more children in need.\n\n“There are a lot of people out there who need help in one form or another,” said Ms Paul. “Don’t hesitate to go out to give them a little help.”\n\nMs Ronita Paul and Ms Geraldine Lee who founded Arc Children’s Centre.\n\nPhotos: The Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/81eff69196b3d5e194768e3610c7e7b6fc23cb36ca44f8351673a0e7bf6a797b?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Devanantthan Tamilselvii, co-founder of Mental ACT."}]}

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/bangladesh-seeks-new-road", "site_title": "Bangladesh seeks a new road", "publish_date": null, "content": "News\n\nBangladesh seeks a new road\n\nUPDATED\n\nAug 8, 2024, 5:59 PM\n\nBangladesh’s interim government will be headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.\n\nREUTERS\n\nI was in Little Bangladesh, opposite Mustafa Centre, on Sunday afternoon. At one of the provision shops there, I asked the Bangladeshi standing next to me: “What on earth is happening in your country?” He looked askance at me and replied with a smile: “Don’t worry. Everything will be fine in a week.”\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh fell from power on Monday.\n\nLooking back on my encounter with the customer, I realise that he was enigmatically correct. When he said “fine”, I thought he meant his government would gain the upper hand over protesters who had paralysed life in Bangladesh and restore order.\n\nWhat occurred, instead, was the departure of a vilified leader, whisked away to safety in India; the dissolution of Parliament; and the announcement of an interim government tasked with bringing Bangladesh back to normalcy.\n\nSo, my enigmatic interlocutor was correct. The point was a return to order, not the political longevity of a leader who had equated herself with normalcy even though her rule had been marked by widespread human rights abuses, including the not-so-mysterious “disappearances” of those who had defied the writ of her Awami League party; and the widespread jailing of her political opponents from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other organisations.\n\nNow, normalcy in Bangladesh rests on the efforts of the interim government.\n\nThe good news is that the caretaker administration will be headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the banker-economist whose pioneering application of the concepts of microcredit and microfinance transformed the lives of millions of poor Bangladeshis, particularly women – to the point that Ms Hasina took him to be a political threat to her “normalcy”.\n\nThe bad news is that retribution has infected Bangladesh’s return to calm, leading to near-anarchy in parts of the country as those who were cast aside violently during Ms Hasina’s rule have returned to the seething streets. They have killed local Awami League politicos and burned their homes and businesses. Minority communities that were a bastion of support for Ms Hasina have come under ethnically-driven attack. Everything is anything but fine as the customer’s promised week approaches an end.\n\nBangladesh is witnessing the classic aftermath of a revolution. An existing order has been overthrown and a new order waits to be born, but there is no hospital or doctor or midwife in sight. So, screaming and writhing, the mother delivers the baby herself, cuts off the umbilical cord as best as she can and cradles her everything in her arms. The father arrives, exultant (although he played no part in the birth). The baby sleeps on: She is the new name of the normal.\n\nIt will be the same in Bangladesh. After the birthing violence of a new order, the quest for justice will continue. Bengalis will go back to eating rice with hilsa fish (when they can afford the delicacy), writing poetry and plotting what to do with their new rulers should they begin to resemble their predecessors. Bangladesh will continue being itself: talented, fretful, contentious and insatiable.\n\nOf course, a nation is more than a metaphorical baby. Ms Hasina’s fall has circumscribed the copious Indian ambit in Bangladeshi affairs to the strategic advantage of Pakistan and China. No matter which political dispensation comes to power after the next election – it is safe to assume it will not be the Awami League – Bangladesh cannot afford to annoy India beyond a point since its economy and security are intertwined with those of its giant neighbour. Bangladesh may well tilt away from India (as it has done in the past), but it cannot tilt so closely towards China that it disturbs the balance of power in South Asia.\n\nAs for Pakistan, from which Bangladesh seceded with Indian help in 1971, its relations with even the new normal in Bangladesh cannot transcend the historical reality of separation in which West Pakistan and East Pakistan went their different cultural and national ways in spite of a common religion.\n\nIt is tautological, but Bangladesh will remain Bangladesh.\n\nBy Asad Latif\n\nThe writer is a former Straits Times journalist.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ef22495b0ea3efb2f5ca003d6fb6bc9e91353daaf22a40be7554297b0b1c8b9f?w=825", "alt_text": "Bangladesh’s interim government will be headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus."}]}

If you do, then it is concerning, and you must know the reasons behind it and learn how to adjust your walking routine to help you breathe easier and enjoy your walks more.\n\nBefore finding the solutions, it’s important to recognise why you might be experiencing breathlessness while walking. Common causes include poor physical fitness, respiratory conditions like asthma, cardiovascular issues or even just walking too quickly.\n\nUnderstanding the root cause can help you make the right adjustments to your walking routine.\n\nAlways start slow\n\nStart with shorter, slower walks to allow your body to adapt. Begin with a comfortable pace, and as your fitness improves, gradually increase the duration and intensity of your walks. This gradual approach helps build stamina and lung capacity without overwhelming your respiratory system.\n\nWatch how you breathe\n\nEffective breathing techniques can make a significant difference. Try practising deep, diaphragmatic breathing, where you focus on breathing deeply into your abdomen rather than shallow breaths into your chest. This type of breathing enhances oxygen intake and helps regulate your breath.\n\nWalk with the right posture\n\nProper posture while walking can improve your breathing efficiency. Stand tall with your shoulders back and your head aligned with your spine. Avoid slouching as this can compress your lungs and make breathing more difficult. Engaging your core muscles also helps stabilise your torso and supports better lung function.\n\nTake breaks\n\nIncorporate interval training into your walking routine. This involves alternating between periods of brisk walking and slower, recovery walking. For instance, walk briskly for two minutes, then slow down for one minute. This method helps improve cardiovascular fitness and breathing capacity.\n\nStart with a five-minute warm-up walk at a comfortable pace. Then, alternate one-minute intervals of brisk walking with two minutes of slower walking. As your fitness improves, adjust the intervals to suit your progress.\n\nDrink lots of water\n\nDehydration and poor nutrition can impact your breathing and overall stamina. Ensure you are drinking plenty of water before, during and after your walk. Eating a balanced diet with adequate carbohydrates, proteins and healthy fats also supports your energy levels and helps maintain effective lung function.\n\nCarry a water bottle during your walks and take sips regularly. Consider having a light snack like a banana or a handful of nuts about 30 minutes before your walk for sustained energy.\n\nConsult a doctor\n\nIf you continue to experience significant breathlessness despite making adjustments, it’s wise to consult a healthcare professional.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d4267b03558cd25c3d7a4d3fd5a877b564bd6a0cf59532a7760f9c4b2b640cc4?w=825", "alt_text": "Photo: Lifestream Group"}]}

However, Phogat felt she doesn’t have what it takes to continue any more.\n\nCuba’s Yusneylys Guzman Lopez replaced Phogat in the final, which Hildebrandt won 3-0 to take the gold.\n\nMany in India blamed Phogat’s personal coach and dietician for her plight.\n\nHer uncle Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trained her early in her career, said the coaches should have managed her diet better and added that shaving her head might have reduced her weight.\n\nSpeaking to the media at his village Balali in Haryana, Mahavir, whose story inspired the box-office hit Dangal, said: “If I were with Vinesh, I would have advised her to shave her head, as cutting her hair would have reduced her weight by at least 200g. Unfortunately, this idea did not occur to Vinesh’s coach, and they did not communicate with me to resolve this issue.”\n\nFrustrated by the disqualification, Mahavir added: “Rules are there, but if a wrestler is 50-100g overweight, they are usually allowed to compete. But it’s gone now.”\n\nWrestling Federation of India president Sanjay Singh also questioned how a mistake of such magnitude could be made on such a big stage.\n\n“The player is fully focused on her practice; it would be unfair to blame her for this. Why is the support staff sent with the athlete (to the Games)? Have they gone there for tourism?” Mr Singh said.\n\nHowever, former Indian badminton star and 2012 London Olympics bronze-medal winner Saina Nehwal felt Phogat should carry equal blame for her disqualification\n\n“It is not like she is competing in her first Olympics, it’s her third Olympics,” said Nehwal. “As an athlete, she must know the rules. At such a big stage, I have not heard of any other wrestler disqualified due to being overweight.”\n\n“If I were with Vinesh, I would have advised her to shave her head, as cutting her hair would have reduced her weight by at least 200g.”\n\nVinesh Phogat’s uncle Mahavir Singh Phogat", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3f17dffd1e3f02f7d51a5213d35e871c19312cc63a12af5728572e20641ffbd3?w=825", "alt_text": "Vinesh Phogat of India."}]}

I also learnt that my part was almost a parallel lead to Vikram’s. In the end, I spent close to a year in India for the shoot.”\n\nThangalaan, starring actors Vikram, Malavika Mohanan and Parvathy Thiruvothu tells the story of a fierce tribal leader during the British Raj, who sets out to stop a sorceress amid searching for gold in the village mines.\n\n“I’m not an expert on Indian cinema, but every time I tuned in to an Indian film and there was a British actor, I would laugh out loud at the bad acting, or how the role would be so cliched,” said Caltagirone.\n\n“But I was impressed by the research the Thangalaan team had done on me. They knew what exactly I could do and what they wanted from me.”\n\nThe actor admitted that it took him a few days to settle down on the set.\n\n“I’m more of a naturalistic actor, but Ranjith wanted something more, which I found to be over-the-top. We had a lot of back and forth and I was getting frustrated. But then one day, he made me look at the monitor where I noticed my acting was not registering among the other actors’ heightened acting. Something clicked that day and I was able to up the ante.”\n\nDaniel added that for the first time in his career he jumped into a project solely based on faith in the director.\n\n“I went on this journey by improvising based on the scene outlines provided by Pa Ranjith,” the actor said. “He convinced me to do this film with his vision.\n\n“I just got lucky because I had amazing co-stars. Parvathy is a brilliant actor, while I just clicked immediately with Malavika. Vikram and I became very close; he liked my style and I respect and like how he worked. Apart from having a great working relationship, they were also able to guide me and help me because of the different methodologies.”\n\nDaniel told the Hindustan times that the film was one of the toughest jobs he’s done, but also “one of the most special”.\n\n“India is often associated with Bollywood, but it’s so much more than that,” he said. “The Tamil film industry is gaining recognition in India, and I feel privileged to be a part of that.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b1e0347cf1653368d926bb7d1f849f220dfdb7196386c1a62c069d1293c95dae?w=825", "alt_text": "British actor Daniel Caltagirone and Tamil film director Pa Ranjith."}]}

It is not merely a directory but a well-organised collection of existing information that has been gathered from various sources across the internet,” Mr Raja said.\n\nFor example, one can find information about a teacher who is also a community leader, an author, and a sports enthusiast, all in one place, he said.\n\nThe microsite documents key developments and notable figures in the Singapore Indian Muslim community, including publications and resources by Indian Muslims as well as those written by others about Indian Muslims.\n\nWith 111 subjects, 58 personalities, 30 institutions and 705 links featured, Mr Raja said the site’s content is non-exhaustive and will be continually updated.\n\nThe criteria for selection include having an independent mention on authoritative third-party websites, such as government or official institutions, and being recognised through national awards or respected institutions. Additionally, individuals must have excelled in their professional fields or served the community in significant capacities within government or influential agencies.\n\nMr Raja said he hopes it will be a valuable resource for scholars, community leaders, students and anyone who wants to know more about their community.\n\nThe idea for the microsite was conceived four years ago when he gave Mr Raja a call on Hari Raya morning, said Mr Arun Mahizhnan, the chief executive of CSTC.\n\n“The world of the Indian Muslims in Singapore is a continuation of what existed more than 2,000 years ago in this region.

He rushed outside his house to check what it was.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nA massive landslide slammed into his house and took out similar dwellings in the area.\n\nPretty soon water and boulders came tumbling down, sweeping or burying people to their deaths as they slept.\n\nMr Pranjeesh told the Press Trust of India that he dashed to a nearby forest to escape nature’s fury.\n\nBut he lost three members of his family in the four landslides that struck the hamlet of Mundakkai in Kerala’s Wayanad district at around 2am on Tuesday.\n\nThe landslides, triggered by torrential rains, also devastated other hamlets and towns in the area such as Chooralmala, Attamala and Noolpuzha, killing at least 167 people, including women and children.\n\nIt was the worst disaster in the state since the deadly floods of 2018.\n\nFlattened buildings, mud-filled potholes and cracked land dotted with huge boulders – these were the scenes at Mundakkai junction and nearby Chooralmala town on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to unofficial figures, there were around 500 houses in Mundakkai, but only 49 are left.\n\nBefore the massive landslides hit the hill district, the places were nerve centres of activities for people living in the area. They were full of shops and concrete structures.\n\nKnown for its scenic interiors and picturesque waterfalls, Chooralmala was a sought-after tourist destination. Soochippara waterfalls, Vellolippara and Seetha Lake were some of the spots that attracted tourists to the area.\n\nWith mounds of mud and debris and giant boulders brought down by floodwaters from the hilltop, it was hard for anyone to believe that the place was a busy town until a day before.\n\nPeople could be seen frantically searching for the dead and injured amid the damaged structures and beneath the heaps of debris, reported Reuters.\n\nThe roofs of buildings were flattened and damaged vehicles were spotted stuck to boulders in many areas.\n\n“We have lost everything... everyone... Nothing is left for us here,” an elderly man could be heard whispering amid his search in Mundakkai. He apparently lost his family members and was desperately searching for them.\n\nMany people appeared to be walking with uncertainty over whether their loved ones lay buried beneath the ground they were treading on.\n\n“Mundakkai is now wiped out from the map of Wayanad. Nothing is left here. You can see... there is nothing other than mud and boulders here. We could not even walk properly due to this thick mud... Then how do we search for our beloved ones buried beneath the ground?” another man asked with teary eyes.\n\nExperts said the area had received heavy rain in the last two weeks that softened the soil. Extremely heavy rainfall on Monday then triggered the landslides.\n\nNearly 1,600 people were rescued from the hillside villages and tea and cardamom estates, authorities said on Wednesday. More than 8,000 people were being sheltered in camps across the district.\n\nVarious rescue agencies resumed their operations early on Thursday to trace people suspected to be trapped in the tragedy, which has left 186 injured and scores missing.\n\nFears of mounting fatalities have been sparked by suspicions that several people may still be trapped under the debris. But hopes of finding survivors have begun to fade as rescuers have to work through slush and rocks.\n\nSteady rain and the rising water level in a local river have hampered the rescue, with a temporary bridge built to connect the worst affected area of Mundakkai being washed away.\n\nWayanad’s district administrator said people had been asked on Wednesday to shift to camps “as soon as possible as there is a danger”.\n\nRescuers found 24 bodies and six body parts on Wednesday and were not hopeful of finding any survivors more than 36 hours after the tragedy, one official in Chooralmala said.\n\nThe landslides were mostly on the upper slopes of hills which then cascaded to the valley below, state police officer M.R. Ajith Kumar told Reuters.\n\nNearly 350 of the 400 registered houses in the affected region have been damaged, Asianet reported, citing district officials.\n\nThe Indian Navy said its disaster relief team reached the area on Tuesday night and search-and-rescue helicopters were deployed early on Wednesday, but adverse weather conditions due to “incessant rains” posed challenges.\n\n“Mundakkai is now wiped out from the map of Wayanad.

It’s the product of age (51) and the offspring of tension. Coaching India in cricket is the cousin of managing England in football. It’s victory or nothing. He got victory a month ago and he left.\n\nRahul Dravid is picking at his salad over dinner in a Parisian cafe. He does this carefully if not quite as studiously as he once decided which ball to hit. The subject is Rafael Nadal and he says “people want to remember athletes at their best. They don’t want to see champions struggle”.\n\n“But,” says Dravid, who himself had a degree in endeavour and overcoming, “there’s a beauty in struggle.”\n\nThis dinner was not the original plan. The plan was to accompany a retired legend from one sport to see an almost retired legend in another. What do they see? Is a champion intrinsically a fan? Do they feel awe yet also empathy?\n\nDravid, whose last assignment was head coach when India won the men’s T20 World Cup in June, is the right man to chat with about Nadal. He understands endings as all athletes do. He played for India for 16 years so he knows the discipline of longevity but also that elasticity expires and feet slow. You can’t be what you were if you are not where the ball is.\n\nBut the plan failed. Dravid went to see Nadal v Novak Djokovic, both men he admires, at Roland Garros and I got busy with another story. Scheduling, you understand.\n\nSo I get the second-best thing, a reluctant debrief on Nadal-Djokovic over dinner. Dravid’s not too keen on this because he’s spent a life buried under questions. But I’m persistent and we’ve known each other for nearly 30 years and he acquiesces with a sigh.\n\nAthletes might travel the world but they do so with a narrow focus. When you play – or coach – you barely see anything beyond your own world. Dravid, an interested man with a reading habit, has never spent so long at an Olympics. Never seen Nadal at Roland Garros even as he understands the idea of gods and holy grounds.\n\nAt the Olympic hockey as India play he’s transfixed. “I now know what fans feel like,” he says. But when I ask if he likes this distance from sport, which is where the rest of us live, he’s uneasy. No, he wants to be inside a sport, feeling its rhythms and its edginess. Not just watch a game but affect it. “I couldn’t watch cricket without being involved.”\n\nThe French wander by our cafe table, oblivious to him, though in 1900, here in Paris, cricket was held at the Olympics and only two teams participated. England, represented by a club from Devon and, gulp, France, aided by members of the British embassy.\n\nCricket wants to be at these Games, this “celebration of sport” as Dravid puts it. “You have to wait four years,” he says in wonder at the Olympian’s wait for another chance. Cricket has its own four-yearly World Cup but it can’t compare. “A lot of important cricket happens around the Cup,” he says. It’s not, as usually happens for many athletes at the Olympics, the only place to become a legend.\n\nNadal v Djokovic is two men fighting each other, as they ward off time. The Serb is sharp, the Spaniard is searching his memory for who he was. Still, Dravid says, shaking his head in disbelief, “the level of skill on certain points, the level of fight”.\n\nEverything ends, but Dravid doesn’t buy the chatter which surrounds ageing athletes. Retire? Who says? “People say retire at your best, but you play because you love it.” And Nadal still loves it. He’ll struggle till he doesn’t want to struggle. At 0-4 down in the second set, he makes it 4-4.\n\n“He never gave up,” Dravid smiles. He, obdurate himself once, admires this type of athlete who comes to work with a pickaxe. Dig, dig, dig, till you’re empty.\n\nThese Olympics consist mostly of the shining young, but also of greatness that is slowly rusting. Talent always leaks away. We see this but we never know what it feels like. “When you have it,” explains Dravid, “then you can get yourself out of trouble.”\n\nHe pauses.\n\n“When you’re great, you’re not hopeful.”\n\nNo, talent just confidently flows.\n\nInside the cafe, a waiter from Bangladesh recognises Dravid. He arrives wearing a shy smile and asks for a wefie. The dinner’s over and Dravid poses politely. In some small ways, fan and legend are the same. At Roland Garros, he saw Nadal like people once saw him. An enduring part of our lives.\n\n“So many people stood,” he says when Nadal lost and left.\n\n“I stood as well.”\n\nRohit Brijnath\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2dbcf9462d363430d07664ba5d8343f2f6bf02a07ec0043c5affa6deae277f55?w=825", "alt_text": "Former cricket star Rahul Dravid as a spectator at the Paris Olympics."}]}

So I’ve never had the desire to have kids, and always saw making this choice for the greater good,” said Mr Chandhru, a customer experience manager at Delta Airlines.\n\n“During the first five years of our marriage, I would ask Shamini every year on our wedding anniversary if she wanted to have kids. She kept saying no, so we were always on the same frequency.”\n\nMs Shamini, a SkillsFuture trainer and an avid traveller, said she often notices how her friends who have kids struggle to find the time or money to travel.\n\n“There are many reasons why I don’t want to have kids, but an important one, apart from my passion for travelling, was the fact that I was working in a special needs school when I got married,” she explained.\n\n“Having my own kids would mean less time and attention for my kids in school and I did not want to put myself in that position.\n\n“And when my motherly instincts kick in, I’ll usually just dote on my nieces and nephews before returning them to their parents when they get too tough to handle.”\n\nThe couple, who live in a five-room flat in Pasir Ris, earn a combined monthly income of more than $10,000 and travel three to six times annually.\n\nMs Shamini said she used to get paid more when she was an actress on Vasantham.\n\n“Our combined annual income used to be more than $15,000 when we were younger and in our former jobs, but now, we have decided to relax a bit more.”\n\nWhen asked what their parents thought of their decision not to have children, Ms Shamini said her parents support her decisions no matter what, while Mr Chandru pointed out that his dad was a science teacher, and so was “pragmatic and understanding” about the issue.\n\nMr Chandhru said that without kids, he has been able to set aside a room in his flat as his “man cave”, where he spends his time watching movies and storing his collectibles.\n\n“Not having kids has given us more freedom to spend our money on things we like and that is what we cherish the most,” he said. “When you don’t have kids you get to be the kids.”\n\nTo fill their paternal and maternal voids, the couple adopted a dog about 15 years ago. Sadly, Mylo died in 2018. The couple then adopted another dog, Rainbow, two years later.\n\n“For the 14 and a half years Mylo was with us, it was magical. He truly was a kid to us,” said Ms Shamini.\n\n“As much as having a furkid is also an expensive affair, at least it does not talk back,” she added with a laugh.\n\nMr Chandhru Palmanavan and Mrs Shamini Chandhru.\n\n“Not having kids has given us more freedom to spend our money on things we like and that is what we cherish the most.”\n\nMr Chandhru Palmanavan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ce2d5dda9f0f87370ff68abf9abe81f4290655824495136e0d814ec1470f110e?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Chandhru Palmanavan and Mrs Shamini Chandhru with their dog Mylo."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nPro Bono SG, a community legal clinic that offers free legal awareness programmes, guidance and legal representation, organised the second edition of its Migrant Justice League last Sunday.\n\nThe cricket tournament for migrant workers, supported by The Majurity Trust’s Scaffold Fund, has two aims: Raise awareness of the free legal services Pro Bono SG offers and build friendships between migrant workers and the legal fraternity.\n\nTwelve teams competed in the finals at the Ceylon Sports Club (CSC), with Ojha Boys beating Genuine Friends by seven runs to bag the trophy and a cash prize of $4,000.\n\nThe six-week-long tournament saw the participation of nearly 1,340 migrant workers, who formed 183 teams and participated in the preliminary rounds at the Kranji, Cochrane, Tuas South, Penjuru recreation centres and the Migrant Workers’ Centre Recreation Club.\n\nMore than 500 people turned up at the CSC during the semi-finals and final on Sunday, including lawyers, volunteers, donors, representatives from The Majurity Trust and cricket lovers.\n\nPro Bono SG chairman and senior counsel Gregory Vijayendran said the tournament benefited more than 4,000 migrant workers who got the chance to know about the free legal service Pro Bono SG offers.\n\n“A tournament like this breaks down barriers of understanding and perceptions,” he said. “It helps us to be on the same field, know each other better, build friendships and, for the migrant worker community, not to be afraid of lawyers.\n\n“We know that many of them are very shy, they are actually afraid to tell their problems. So the hope is that something like this will reduce and remove as much barriers as possible and help them realise the lawyers are as human as them. They will also know who to call if there’s a problem.”\n\nThe migrant workers make up one of the most vulnerable communities in Singapore and often find it difficult to access justice and other kinds of support because of language differences and a lack of interaction with individuals who might know where to seek legal help.\n\nPro Bono SG provided free legal help to 60 migrant workers at its Migrant Worker Legal Clinic from January to June this year, including those who speak Tamil, Hindi, Punjabi and Bengali. The most common cases were criminal matters and personal injury and salary claims. Other cases included personal loan, landlord-tenant disputes and scams.\n\nThe Pro Bono SG team also believes that interactions during the tournament will help the legal community better identify the needs of the migrant workers.\n\n“Sports is a great way to unite people,” said Mr Pravinraj Rajendran, captain of the Ojha Boys team. “We are happy that we got to play our favourite sport on a big ground, and that we have Pro Bono SG’s backing if we have legal issues. That is a comforting feeling in these tough times.”\n\nGenuine Friends player Angappan Arivalagan said the tournament was a great occasion to make new friends. “We usually play our cricket at the Soon Lee Migrant Workers’ Centre Recreation Club. So, it was a big jump for us to be playing at Ceylon Sports Club.\n\n“Pro Bono SG gave us this chance. We are also thankful to them for providing us legal help when we need it.”\n\nMr Vijayendran said Pro Bono SG’s aim is to “help these guest workers who have helped build our community”.\n\n“The bonds can be built only over time,” he said. “Last year was the first time we did this tournament. This was the sequel and we hope it was even better and stronger.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/69a6d305554cd7d4f33b2c2dddfdc07004c4cb4de3bacc4c35c08d901bd4aac4?w=825", "alt_text": "Winners Ojha Boys with Pro Bono SG chairman Gregory Vijayendran (standing, fourth from right)."}]}

There are some very good young players and so I’m expecting the scene here to develop.”\n\nYu picked up lawn bowls in 2022 after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing football in his teens. Lawn bowling, he said, does not demand too much of his injured left knee.\n\n“I looked around for a sport I could play, where my injury would not be a physical limitation. And I found bowls, which I had actually been watching since like 2010, but I never knew how to play it,” said the third-year Nanyang Technological University student.\n\n“Only after I got injured did I have the thought that this was a sport that I could play and work hard at to represent Singapore.”\n\n“What’s attracting (young people) to the game is that lawn bowling is a no-contact sport, and you don’t have to be of a particular physical type to play.”\n\nBrett O’Riley, 62, regional director of Oceania for World Bowls", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/776d7e467ad6490ee6dd003989c0f2159bb33e8958791131a7ce33b1d5d010e9?w=825", "alt_text": "Singapore’s Isaac Yu on his way to winning the Under-25 men’s sets title with teammate Harriman Yuen at the Lion City Cup on July 27."}]}

With Bhoomi (which means “earth”), I wanted to take diners back to the basics of Indian cuisine; to how food is traditionally done.\n\nHighlights from the menu include Lucknawi Kakori Kebab ($29), charcoal-grilled minced lamb kebabs in a Lucknawi spice blend; and Chulhewala Nihari Gosht Curry ($29), lamb cooked on a wood-fired clay stove.\n\nBhoomi also offers healthier options, with items such as gluten-free seeded amaranth roti ($7) and Kulthachey Kalan ($12), a soup made with horse gram (a type of lentil).\n\n“The items on the menu are from all over India – from Lucknow to Kerala to Kashmir,” said the chef. “These dishes are of different recipes, of course, but made with the same consistency.

One such innovative approach was seen in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam where a couple designed a wedding card inspired by Apple’s iPhone.\n\nThe viral footage, posted by Laxman Wedding Cards on Instagram, shows a wedding invitation designed to look like an iPhone, reported Times Now.\n\nThe invitation features a book-style layout with three pages attached together. The cover page displays a photo of the couple as the background – similar to an iPhone’s wallpaper – with the wedding date and time shown above it.\n\nInside, one of the pages cleverly mimics a WhatsApp chat, sharing all the necessary details about the wedding events, including the reception time.\n\nAnd for the venue? They have playfully used WhatsApp’s “Send Location” function, revealing the venue location with a unique twist. To top it all, the back cover of the invitation features a realistic camera illustration with a 3D-like effect making it a true standout piece.\n\nThe video has amassed a whopping 15 million views. Internet users were amused and intrigued by the unique design and posted a variety of comments in response, reported NDTV.\n\nSome also inquired about the cost of these cards. One user wrote: ‘‘When a designer gets married! I love the idea.’‘ Another joked: ‘‘Very expensive wedding card.’‘ A third said: ‘‘Appreciate your idea.”\n\nIn the past, Laxman Wedding Cards has also crafted other innovative designs inspired by everyday items. Alongside the iPhone-style invites, they offer wedding cards that resemble passports and newspapers, adding a fun element to the traditional invitation format.\n\nLast year, a Bangladeshi couple’s wedding invitation captured the Internet’s attention for its quirky and creative concept, reported News 18.\n\nThis wasn’t just any ordinary card – it was a playful “research paper” that featured sections like Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and References. The invitation, belonging to Sanjana and Imon from Dhaka, cleverly used academic terms to share their wedding details.\n\nThe Abstract explained the importance of marriage, the Introduction recounted their love story and the Methodology described the wedding plans.\n\nThe title of the card included the names of the couple, along with the venue of the wedding.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/798afe63c47d4b065e469244200f7bb9e43587db5276aa9cf783a5febb6dfd53?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

But he is also in some trouble, as he has earned the wrath of the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) for his unprofessional conduct after signing for a film.\n\nThe award-winning film star, who is separated from superstar Rajinikanth’s daughter, is accused of not giving dates to many producers despite taking hefty amounts as an advance. This has forced the council and other associations to pass a resolution against him.\n\n“Since actor Dhanush has received advance payments from many producers, those planning to start the shoot of any new project with the film star are requested to consult the TFPC,” read a resolution adopted at the joint meeting of the TFPC, Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association, Multiplex Owners Association and Film Distributors Association on Monday.\n\nConcerned by the astronomical salary that artistes and technicians demand and the lack of screen space for small budget movies, TFPC has also suspended new projects from Aug 15 and stopped all film shoots from Nov 1.\n\nThe joint meeting specifically looked at clearing the backlog of films which have been stuck in various stages of production.\n\nLast year, Sri Thenandal Films accused Dhanush of taking a signing amount and then not turning up for the shoot. News of the actor’s behaviour came as a shock to his fans.\n\nIndiaGlitz reported that Dhanush was issued a “red card” by the TFPC along with Tamil actor Vishal, who allegedly “misused the council’s funds during his tenure as TFPC president”.\n\nDhanush’s latest film Raayan is on its way to becoming the all-time highest-grossing film of his career.\n\nHis second directorial venture is having a stellar run in theatres and is marching towards Rs100 crore ($16 million) gross worldwide, reported India Today.

Model Town sub-divisional magistrate Rajiv Sinha met students in Mukherjee Nagar to understand their demands.\n\nStudents have demanded action against coaching centres and landowners and officials for the illegal use of basements. They also demand action on waterlogging in the area, which is prone to flooding due to the lack of proper drainage systems.\n\nIAS coaching institutes primarily focus on preparing students for the Civil Services Examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission in India. The exam is one of the toughest competitive exams in the country and consists of three stages – Preliminary, Main and Personality Test (Interview).\n\nAbout 1.3 million take the exam every year, and there are coaching centres across the country which prepare them for it by collecting hefty fees.\n\nThe tragic death of the three students took place last Saturday after rainwater filled the basement of the coaching centre, which was being used as a library – in violation of rules. Several students were trapped.\n\nThe police and fire department officials received a call at around 7.10pm. A video, seemingly shot hours before the bodies of the three students were recovered, shows students rushing out of the flooded basement. Water was gushing down the stairs as the students waded through it.\n\nA man can be heard asking the students to come out of the basement quickly. “Kids, come up quickly. Quick, quick... Is anyone left behind? Is anyone down there?” he asked.\n\nThree students – Ms Tania Soni, 25, Ms Shreya Yadav, 25, and Mr Navin Delvin, 28 – were left behind and their bodies were recovered after a seven-hour rescue operation involving professional divers.\n\nEven as the police are probing the cause behind the flooding, locals blame the poor drainage system in the area. They say it was heavily clogged with silt and overflowed, leading to a flood-like situation following rains.\n\nOne video showed the road in front of the coaching institute severely waterlogged with waist-deep water levels.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Delhi Police spokesman said a case had been registered and arrests have been made.

Santosh Kumar\n\nInternationally acclaimed bharatanatyam artiste Mythili Prakash is looking forward to performing at the Esplanade with her new, bold and evocative musical work She’s Auspicious, which questions the contradictions and dichotomies of how women are viewed in society.\n\n“I’m very excited,” she told tabla! from her Los Angeles base. “It has been a long gap (12 years) since I performed in Singapore. A lot has changed, and I look forward to sharing this new piece with my Singapore audience.”\n\nIn the 65-minute performance, which will be staged at the Singtel Waterfront Theatre on Aug 10 and 11, the second-generation American performer will examine the irony in her Indian culture between the worship of (goddess) Devi as a symbol of femininity and auspiciousness and the treatment of women in modern society.\n\nThe idea for it was sparked by a previous work she created based on lyrics in a poem about women and the paradoxical roles they are often expected to play in society – such as mother and daughter, fierce and gentle.\n\n“There are many sparks for this creation,” the 42-year-old said. “One starting point was my identity as a woman, a mother, a performer and a practitioner of bharatanatyam. The way I perform these roles – how much of it is conditioned by the expectations of society? How much of it is what actually comes authentically from me? Is there a tension between the two?”\n\nMythili is known to be incisive in her approach, questioning cultural and social norms, while pushing the boundaries of bharatanatyam, particularly around femininity and aesthetics.\n\nHer creative introspections acknowledge and draw fodder from her experiences as a mother, a first-generation child of immigrants and the complexity of her identity as a dancer of caste-privilege in India, while simultaneously a female artiste-of-colour in the US.\n\nThe American, who has emerged at the forefront of a new generation of classical Indian dancers, conceptualised and choreographed the solo performance, which features a rare all-female music ensemble –  Subiksha Rangarajan (vocal), Aswini Srinivasan (percussion) and Ananya Ashok (vocal and veena).\n\n“I love Indian mythology. For me it goes hand in hand with the dance, and has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember,” said Mythili, who was cast as the wife of the titular character in the award-winning film Life of Pi.\n\n“A myth that has prompted a lot of reflection in this piece is the making of Devi by the male gods to kill the demon Mahisha. Our myths hold the values of society, and as we move through time, some of those values stay and some of them change. Some of the ones that stay need to change. Or the way we tell the stories need to change.\n\n“I believe there is no ‘correct way’ to tell the story. I think mythology is a great way to reflect on ourselves as individuals and a society. They are the stories that we hand down through art to our children and future generations of artistes.”\n\nMentored by the iconic Malavika Sarukkai and the esteemed Akram Khan, whose dance company she has been performing with since 2019, Mythili’s She’s Auspicious is essentially about femininity – the way it is perceived, embodied, performed and scrutinised.\n\n“As women, each of us brings our personal experience and energy into the piece,” she said. “For me, it challenges expectations and perspectives that I’ve grown up believing and holding myself, both as a human, as a woman and as a bharatanatyam dancer.\n\n“Believing in specific notions of ‘beauty’ or ‘motherhood’ or ‘perfection’ – so much of this is engrained, and when you start picking at one part of it, everything starts to unravel and comes undone. This has been my experience in working on the piece as well as living my life.”\n\nShe’s Auspicious first premiered in 2021 at the Reflektor Festival in Hamburg, Germany, and underwent further development in 2022 at Pillow’s Lab at the historic Jacob’s Pillow dance centre, and in 2024 at University of Colorado Colorado Springs. Mythili is currently touring with her latest production across the US, Asia and the UK.\n\n“I think mythology is a great way to reflect on ourselves as individuals and a society.

Santosh Kumar\n\nOne hundred and two teams, 286 matches, 2,220 players – all at one venue.\n\nThat’s the proud world record of the Singapore Social Cricket League (SCL) recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records (GWR) as the “largest cricket tournament played at a single venue” from July 13 to Sept 15.\n\nOn Sept 22, GWR’s official adjudicator, Ms Sonia Ushirogochi, flew in from Tokyo to present the award to the chairman of the SCL organising committee, Mr Shaji Philips, before a crowd of 250 at the Ceylon Sports Club.\n\nShe said: “Every record created has a different set of guidelines and for this Singapore record we required video recordings of all the matches and witnesses to attest that International Cricket Council rules were being followed. We also verified the registration data of the players and the scorecards.”\n\nThe Eenadu Cricket Champion Cup, held from Dec 30, 2013, to Feb 20, 2014, saw the participation of 16,215 players. But the matches were played in different venues across India.\n\nOrganised by a group of 10 Sengkang residents and cricket lovers, led by rail engineer Shaji, the SCL was played with a hard tennis ball and across three pitches at the Sengkang Cricket Ground, near Buangkok MRT station.\n\nThe 10-overs-a-side matches were open to players from all over Singapore – including migrant workers – who did not have to pay a cent to play. The organisers footed all expenses.\n\n“I looked through all the data that the organisers provided,” said Ms Ushirogochi. “I had to ask for a lot more. And they worked really hard to provide me the information, as I had to confirm that the league was up to the Guinness Book of World Records’ standard.”\n\nGuinness World Records are not awarded for uniqueness.\n\n“It has to be standardised, something that is measurable and can be broken – because part of the fun is people challenging the records,” said Ms Ushirogochi.\n\nOne of the organisers, business development manager Vijay Badami, said the organising team worked “day and night for almost 10 months” to get the matches going and provide the data to GWR. Punit Shankar, a manager at software company DXC Technology, served as the coordinater.\n\nThe league was started in 2007 in Sengkang by a dedicated group who shared a vision and passion for cricket. It faced many difficulties, but with the encouragement and backing of the Sengkang Community Club and then Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Charles Chong, they found the initial funding for ground rentals, licences and pitch preparation.\n\n“There were many open fields in Sengkang back then. But as the population grew and HDB construction picked up momentum, we had to move from one open field to another,” said Mr Badami. “Every challenge we faced only strengthened our resolve to make the league better.”\n\nMr Chong, a former deputy speaker of Parliament, said: “It’s a momentous occasion for Singapore. Never in our wildest imagination did we expect a small community initiative to extend to a world record. I’m so grateful to all who helped achieve this, especially the grassroots people from Sengkang. I hope that we continue and make it an even bigger event.”\n\nAccording to Mr Shaji, the primary aim of the league was to bring together local residents and expatriates and integrate them into various community activities.\n\n“We also wanted to fulfill the interest of a large number of cricket enthusiasts residing in Sengkang, introduce a new sport to the local community and popularise cricket in the neighbourhood primary schools,” he said.\n\n“In this humble way, we hoped to promote racial harmony, the integration of new immigrants and bonding of different racial groups.”\n\nMr Hemasundar Ramachandra, a founding member of the league, added: “From 2013 onwards, we expanded our league and formed the Singapore Social Cricket League to give more players from across Singapore a chance to play.”\n\n“It’s a momentous occasion for Singapore. Never in our wildest imagination did we expect a small community initiative to extend to a world record.”\n\nFormer Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Charles Chong, who backed the initiative\n\n“It’s not easy for migrant workers to play cricket in Singapore due to the costs involved.

According to a recent study published in the journal BMC Public Health, individuals who drink coffee but lead a sedentary lifestyle experience a significant decrease in mortality risk compared to those who sit for more than six hours daily and do not consume coffee.\n\nThe study conducted on American adults suggests that coffee consumption may offer a protective effect against the negative health impacts associated with prolonged sitting. Non-coffee drinkers, for instance, were found to be nearly 1.6 times more likely to die from all causes compared to coffee drinkers.\n\nWhile sedentary behaviour is generally linked to various health risks, the findings indicate that coffee intake may mitigate the increased mortality risk for those who spend most of the day seated.\n\nDoctors across New Delhi believe the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties in coffee contribute to these benefits. They recommend moderate coffee consumption as part of a balanced diet, along with regular physical activity and nutritious eating habits.\n\nDr Narander Kumar, a consultant in internal medicine and infectious diseases at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, explained to the Times Of India: “The reduction in mortality among coffee drinkers can be attributed to its rich content of polyphenols, which improve vascular function and reduce inflammation.”\n\nSupporting this, Dr Arvind Khurana, principal director of gastroenterology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, said coffee’s antioxidant properties, cardiovascular benefits, improvements in metabolic health, and protective effects on liver health all contribute to lower mortality rates.\n\nHowever, excessive coffee intake can lead to adverse effects such as increased anxiety, sleep disturbances and digestive issues.\n\nDr. Mukesh Mehra, director of internal medicine at Max Super Speciality Hospital in Patparganj, said it is crucial to also consider one’s personal health status and caffeine tolerance.\n\nPhoto: The Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fa0bcfba95a93f1d1fe0c18e802cd47e9d26e8bb4946cf430aec4da9c773d800?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

This year, 511 nominations were received for 158 teachers.\n\nMadam Malar Velee, who has a background in counselling, encourages her students to create their own memes and share them in class, fostering an exchange of ideas and perspectives. This collaborative approach, she said, helps students learn from one another while engaging creatively with the material.\n\n“I want my students to not only learn but also enjoy the process. The first step to making that happen is ensuring they actually look forward to coming to class,” said Madam Malar Velee, who spoke at the World Tamil Teachers Conference in Mauritius last year on the topic of “Enhancing Spoken Interaction Using Memes as a Tool”.\n\nHer students appreciate the fresh approach she brings to the classroom.\n\n“The use of memes in class really enhances our understanding of the topic,” said Shirin Farhana, 15, a Secondary 3 student. “The entertaining presentation makes everything easier to remember and creating our own memes helps us connect with complex topics in a fun way.”\n\nMadam Jayasutha Vijaya Kumaran, another winner at the MITT awards, was also noted for her innovative teaching methods.\n\nThe 48-year-old, the subject head of Malay/Tamil Language at Seng Kang Primary school, uses puppetry to act out stories and interactive games in class.\n\n“Through puppetry, students become more involved and enthusiastic about learning Tamil,” she explained. “They express themselves more freely and enjoy the process of storytelling and role-playing, and in the process, learn at least one new Tamil word each time.”\n\nMadam Jayasutha also developed an “Adi Adi” (meaning slap or beat in Tamil) Snap card game to enrich her students’ vocabulary.\n\nThe game challenges players to match cards featuring similar words and images, reinforcing vocabulary retention while ensuring a fun and competitive learning experience.\n\nThis year’s Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Dr. S.P. Jeyarajadas Pandian in recognition of his 44 years of dedicated service to Tamil teaching in Singapore.\n\nA pioneer in integrating music into Tamil language lessons, he currently works as a part-time lecturer at NIE.\n\nMinister for Home Affairs and Law K.

Winners receive $50,500 in prize money.\n\nUnlike other devices such as smart glasses or apps that require constant interaction, yaR – which denotes “friend” in Hindi (“yaar”) – offers a hands-free and user-friendly experience.\n\n“It was specifically designed to be sleek and lightweight for daily wear,” said Mr Manas. “The team also integrated LTE (long-term evolution) connectivity, allowing the device to work seamlessly without relying on Wi-Fi.”\n\nThe group began their journey in January this year during a hackathon organised by NUS, where they brainstormed ideas addressing various societal needs.\n\nA friend of one of the team members, Mr Ajay Minocha, who is in his 30s and works as a consultant at Deloitte, inspired the group to focus on assistive technology for the visually impaired. Mr Minocha is blind.\n\nWith diverse skill sets in hardware and software, the team began working on their first prototype. The initial version was far from perfect – a bulky, wire-filled device that resembled an arc reactor from Iron Man – but as Mr Yajat put it: “It worked.”\n\nMr Manas said yaR went through continuous user testing and feedback over seven months, adding that the team collaborated with the Singapore Association of Visually Handicapped to test their prototypes.\n\nEarly testers pointed out that the camera was too large, and the buttons were difficult to use, said Mr Yajat. So, the team miniaturised the device, improved the camera’s field of view and added tactile feedback to the buttons.\n\nThe team continues to refine the device, with plans to integrate LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology so yaR can measure distances more accurately, thus improving the AI’s ability to navigate complex environments.\n\n“The goal is to make the technology globally accessible, with plans to manufacture and sell the device at a price expected to remain under $500,” Mr Sparsh said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/451a86e6659d91a6b4489fe85dd3c14dde877bb285914cc1e37b2bf9700f895c?w=825", "alt_text": "(From left) Mr Yajat Gulati, Mr Sparsh, Mr Manas Bam and Mr Shrivardhan Goenka with their invention yaR, a pendant that taps on AI to help the visually impaired."}]}

But one academy has managed to marry the two.\n\nKalari Academy, a local academy that teaches the ancient martial arts of Kalaripayattu, Silambam and Adimurai, pushed boundaries when it staged a martial arts-themed English play, Immortal, at the Stamford Arts Centre on Sept 20 and 21.\n\nWith the aim of bringing ancient Hindu mythologies closer to a modern-day audience, the play revolves around the journey of the immortal warrior Parashurama (referred to by his lesser-known name Bhargava Rama in this play) and how his quest for vengeance leads to a turn of events that makes him question his choices. The play also includes the major fight sequences of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.\n\nAs the actors brandish real weapons – spears, axes and swords – amid 11 fight sequences, the audience were at times on the edge of their seats. In one scene, the inch-perfect choreography stopped a sword mere centimetres from the protagonist’s chest.\n\n“That is the level of trust we have in one another,” said E. Reuben, 29, who plays the lead role of Bhargava Rama and choreographed the fight scenes.\n\n“We have practised so many times together, so I knew the sword would stop precisely at that point.”\n\nThe academy had to apply for a permit from the Infocomm Media Development Authority to use weapons during the show. It also obtained a police permit to bring the weapons into Singapore.\n\nAs a precaution, Reuben said some of the weapons, such as the axe, were “made blunt”.\n\n“But it’s still painful if the weapons make contact,” he said, revealing scars on his hand as a result of rehearsals and training.\n\nThe realistic fight scenes took time to perfect – nine years, said director Vedagiri Govindasamy, who is also the co-founder and main instructor of Kalari Academy. He first thought of the play in 2015, when the academy was formed.\n\nVedagiri, 44, who also plays the Hindu god Shiva, said: “We needed to train our students until they could use real weapons and fight aggressively without hurting one another, so it took nine years of training.”\n\nThose nine years spanned several drafts of the script as Vedagiri expanded the play from his initial 15-minute concept – of a sequence involving Bhargava Rama, Bhishma and Amba – to a full 90-minute show, re-enacting several scenes of the Mahabharata from Bhargava Rama’s perspective.\n\nIn Vedagiri and Reuben, the cast, comprising actors from eight to 50 years old, had two experienced martial art practitioners as coaches.\n\nVedagiri learnt traditional martial arts at the age of eight, and started teaching them at the age of 28.\n\nReuben, who started learning Kalaripayattu and Silambam at the age of 16, trained with Vedagiri at the same school.\n\nThe play also weaved in dance sequences from two Kalari student-dancers, while live instruments added to its harmony.\n\nWhile the play is rooted in Hindu mythologies, its English medium invited a highly multiracial audience. Each member of the audience was given a booklet with some context on the lineage of Parashurama.\n\nAudience member Rajkumar applauded the play: “Presenting Hindu mythologies in the form of a martial arts play is something new. Normally, we experience such tales only in the form of books and television shows.”\n\nVedagiri said the tale of Immortal is “not over yet”.\n\n“This play is just the first part of a Vedic trilogy.

With its departure, the entire Times Bookstores chain will fade into history – going, going, gone.\n\nI remember Times Bookstores in Paragon, Plaza Singapura, Marina Square and my personal favourite, the flagship outlet at Centrepoint. It was the first bookstore I visited when I arrived in Singapore to work for The New Paper in 1988.\n\nI came from Kolkata in India, a city known for its writers and booklovers; it has an entire road, College Street, occupied by colleges, universities, bookshops and pavement book stalls.\n\nTo my dismay, the British Council library here wasn’t half as well stocked as the one back home. But then I discovered the Times Bookstore at Centrepoint, and it was a little slice of heaven.\n\nI can’t remember which floor it was on, but I vividly recall the pleasure of riding the escalator up, wandering among the shelves, picking up a book or a magazine, and getting lost in its pages.\n\nThere, time ceased to matter. I was alone in a new city – but surrounded by books, I never felt lonely. I browsed for hours without interruption. No one questioned how long I spent in that place, immersed in words.\n\nIt was at Times Bookstore that I bought my copy of The God Of Small Things by Arundhati Roy and The Information by Martin Amis – two novels I remember distinctly, though ironically, I never finished either. Despite my admiration for Roy’s dazzling prose and Amis’ brilliance, I lost interest in the narratives.\n\nTimes Bookstores wasn’t just a treasure trove of books, but also a gateway to a world of periodicals. That’s where I first encountered Vanity Fair, a magazine that, under Graydon Carter’s editorship, epitomised elegance with its gorgeous photography, exquisite design and sophisticated writing.\n\nI also frequented the Paragon outlet to pick up The Economist. The Paragon branch was close enough to my office at Times House in Kim Seng Road, where The New Paper was then published. After a day’s work, I’d catch a bus, grab a copy and head home. It was the golden age of magazines – Time and Newsweek were staples, but The Economist stood out for its incisive and witty take on current affairs, always delivered with clarity and a sly grin.\n\nThough Times Bookstores held a special place in my heart, I was never monogamous when it came to bookshops. There was a little store – in either Peace Centre or Paradiz Centre, I can’t quite recall – where I’d borrow books and videos. The friendly Indian owner and his assistant knew my tastes well and always had something set aside for me.\n\nAs time passed, Singapore saw a blossoming of grand bookstores. MPH’s flagship, housed in a stately colonial building at the junction of Armenian Street and Stamford Road, boasted an impressive collection of books and CDs. Borders at Wheelock Place took it a step further, allowing visitors to listen to CDs for free. And, of course, there was Books Kinokuniya at Ngee Ann City, a vast, bustling hub that resembled a library. On weekends, I’d lose myself there for hours, only to drop by library@orchard, which conveniently happened to be in the same building, for more reading material.\n\nBut those glory days of Singapore’s grand bookstores are behind us. The closure of the last Times Bookstores outlet is the final chapter in a sad saga that has already seen the end of MPH and Borders. Only Kinokuniya soldiers on.\n\nA senior citizen now of sedentary habits, I no longer toddle off to my old haunts. Almost all the reading I do these days is online or on an e-reader. But no e-book can compare with the tactile pleasure of a printed book – the rustle of the pages, pristine scent of a new book, the beauty of a well-designed cover.\n\nPerhaps, like vinyl records, bookshops will one day make a comeback. Whether that happens in my lifetime, though, is anyone’s guess.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8a31ac8a70f42b3794ee3a5ec98a14655305a01844831352193f79e7f7017cd6?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nHealth Minister Ong Ye Kung’s promise to explore the possibility of setting up a physical Naval Base Kerala Library (NBKL) in Sembawang has come as a boost to the Malayalee community, who celebrated the NBKL’s 70th anniversary on Sept 7.\n\nSpeaking as the guest of honour at the NBKL’s Onam festivities and anniversary celebrations at the Singapore Expo, Mr Ong, who is also an MP for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency, suggested the possibility of the NBKL co-existing with a library planned to be built at Bukit Canberra Hub.\n\nBukit Canberra is an integrated sports and community hub next to Sembawang MRT station. It houses, among other facilities, an indoor sports hall, a polyclinic, a senior care centre and a hawker centre.\n\n“For a long time we have been looking to set up a physical library,” said Mr V. Bimel Ram, 57, adviser and former NBKL president. “We were looking to do it at a void deck.\n\n“The minister’s support for our endeavour has come as a tremendous boost. We want to bring back the glory days of the NBKL when it was a centre for the Malayalee community in Singapore to meet during the 1950s to the 1970s.”\n\nThe NBKL was started in 1954 at the British Naval Base in Sembawang by a group of Malayalees who wanted to find a space to share and exchange books, magazines and newspapers.\n\nThe British Naval Base was then known as Kochu Keralam, or Little Kerala, as it had a very large number of Malayalees who lived and worked there.\n\nThe founding group was led by Mr Poravankara Narayanan Nair, the late father of former The New Paper editor P.N. Balji.\n\nThe NBKL quickly grew from a cosy hub for Malayalee literature lovers to a library boasting thousands of books (more than 2,000 of them are currently held by different members who are waiting for a physical library to open). It also became a nucleus of drama, culture and sports for the Malayalee diaspora.\n\nFor its 10th anniversary, the NBKL marquee Ona Ravu event featured an array of cultural performances and attracted distinguished guests, including then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n“My memories of NBKL are hazy,” said Mr Balji, 75. “But I remember the rare occasions my father used to take me there. Looking back, I realise there were people who would die for language and traditions.”\n\nCardiologist V.P. Nair, 83, has vivid memories of the NBKL at Sembawang. “Those days, there were very few Indian associations,” he said. “One was the Singapore Kerala Association, which later became the Singapore Malayalee Association and is now 107 years old. The other was the Naval Base Kerala Library.\n\n“Many from the community, like my parents, came over from Kerala to work at the Naval Base. And they did not have Malayalam papers or books to read. So they started a library.”\n\nHowever, the British military withdrawal from Singapore in the late 1960s led to a Malayalee migration, prompting NBKL to relocate its vibrant cultural activities to the Victoria Theatre and other more central venues.\n\nIn 1986, it moved in with the Seletar Sports Club at Durban Road. But in 2001, the building was taken over by the Singapore Land Authority, forcing the NBKL to work with community centres in Sembawang and Yishun.\n\nSoon after, the support for the NBKL dwindled, and it became an organisation that did not have a physical space.\n\nOver the past two decades, it has been the likes of Mr Bimel who have kept it going.\n\n“The NBKL remains a library of cultural, social and sports activities for the Malayalees,” said Mr Bimel. “It is something we call the NBKL spirit, to punch above the weight and remain relevant. The many volunteers and kind sponsors have given strength to our determination.”\n\nThe NBKL now has about 30 life members. Its executive committee is led by president Sudheer Govindapillai, 50, who works in the oil and gas industry and came to Singapore in 2003 for work.\n\nOther prominent members are vice-president Rekha Vasupurath, secretary Loshy Balan and treasurer Pushpachandran Pillai.\n\n“It has been a struggle for us to keep the NBKL active because of a lack of funds and membership,” said Mr Sudheer. “So, we have taken to organsing cultural activities, with Ona Ravu our major event of the year.\n\n“We make great efforts to give Malayalees a stage to show their talents. Our aim is to find a permanent place to make our activities more regular.”\n\nMany members of the Malayalee community support this move.\n\nSaid Mr Rajeshkumar Gopalakrishnan, a documentarian and publisher: “During my interactions with several senior individuals while working on the History Wall project during SG50 and the documentary about Malayalees’ contributions in Singapore for the National Library, I gained a deep appreciation for the rich heritage of the Naval Base Kerala Library.\n\n“I’m thrilled to see the new generation of NBKL working hard to bring a physical library to life once again, preserving its legacy for future generations.”\n\n“The NBKL remains a library of cultural, social and sports activities for the Malayalees. It is something we call the NBKL spirit, to punch above the weight and remain relevant. The many volunteers and kind sponsors have given strength to our determination.”\n\nNBKL adviser Bimel Ram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/56f71e583e5c982319fe1db5e3fb9cce02656035bacd2e7e8c8ffde03f989cbb?w=825", "alt_text": "Health Minister Ong Ye Kung at the Naval Base Kerala Library’s 70th anniversary celebrations."}]}

Chandrababu Naidu has accused the state’s previous YSR Congress (YSRCP) government of using animal fat and substandard ingredients in making the Tirupati laddoo, which is served as “prasadam” (food that is first offered to a deity and then distributed to devotees) at the famous Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati.\n\nSpeaking at the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) legislature party meeting in Amravati on Wednesday to mark 100 days of his government, Mr Naidu said: “In the past five years, YSR Congress party leaders have tarnished the sanctity of Tirumala.\n\n“They compromised on the quality of ‘annadanam’ (free meals) and even contaminated the Tirumala laddoo by using animal fat instead of ghee. This revelation has caused concern. However, we are now using pure ghee. We want to protect the sanctity of the TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams).”\n\nMr Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party came to power in Andhra Pradesh in June in an alliance with the Jana Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Tirupati temple is managed by the TTD.\n\nThe temple trust prepares about 300,000 laddoos daily and the prasadam is held in high regard by devotees.\n\nDuring the YSRCP government’s term, the TTD gave the ghee supply contract to a private vendor, replacing the Nandini brand of ghee, a product of the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).\n\nFollowing the change in supplier, there were several complaints over the quality of the laddoo.\n\nThe NDA government on Aug 29 signed a new contract with KMF to supply ghee. TTD utilises about 10,000kg of ghee daily for the laddoo prasadam.\n\nAndra Pradesh IT Minister Nara Lokesh also targeted the previous Jagan Mohan Reddy government over the issue.\n\n“The Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple at Tirumala is our most sacred temple. I am shocked to learn that the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy administration used animal fat instead of ghee in the Tirupati prasadam,” he said in a post on X.\n\nSenior YSRCP leader Y.V. Subba Reddy, who was the TTD chairman during the YSRCP term, took to X and defended his party, saying that Mr Naidu had committed a sin by hurting the sentiments of millions of Hindus.\n\nThe YSRCP later termed Mr Naidu’s allegation as “malicious” and said the Telugu Desam Party leader would “stoop to any level for political gain”.\n\n“No person would speak such words or make such accusations,” said Mr Reddy in a post on X.\n\n“To strengthen the faith of the devotees, I, along with my family, am ready to take an oath before the almighty regarding the Tirumala prasadam. Is Chandrababu Naidu willing to do the same with his family?”\n\nAndhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.\n\n(Photo/ANI)\n\nN.

He and three others, who are from Karnataka, were prey to a job fraud along with about 60 more young men from India.\n\nMany others are still stuck in Russia, awaiting rescue, having to serve as soldiers in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nPromising jobs as security personnel or helpers in Russia, young men flocked to the job offers and many were shipped out to Russia in December 2023, only to get the shock of their lives upon arrival.\n\n“We were treated like slaves,” Mr Sufiyan told the Times of India. “We were woken up at 6am every day and made to work 15 hours straight – with no rest or sleep. The conditions were inhuman.”\n\nThey had to manage difficult tasks with a meagre ration of food.\n\nAfter being drafted into service, the men had to dig trenches and use assault rifles. They were even trained to use Kalashnikovs such as the AK-12 and AK-74, hand grenades and other explosives.\n\n“Our hands were blistered, our backs ached and our spirits were broken. Yet, if we showed any signs of exhaustion, bullets were fired at us to force us back into the laborious tasks,” Mr Sufiyan said.\n\nBeyond the physical toll was the psychological burden of living disconnected from the world. Their phones had been confiscated and they didn’t know when they would return or when they could talk to their family next.\n\nMr Sufiyan and his companions recalled how they never knew with certainty where they were – or were being taken to – and were not allowed to communicate with their families back in India.\n\n“Our mobile phones were seized. For months during the training, I could not talk to my family,” said Mr Abdul Nayeem from Karnataka, fighting back tears.\n\nThe psychological toll of living in an alien war zone was immense on the men. Mr Syed Ilias Hussaini, a resident of Kalaburagi in Karnataka, described the constant fear of being caught in the crossfire and the unrelenting pressure to perform under life-threatening circumstances.\n\n“Every day we woke up not knowing if it would be our last. The sound of gunfire and explosions became a constant backdrop in our lives, and we lived in perpetual fear,” he said.\n\nThe only way to cope, the men said, was to pray and imagine a day when they would set foot back in India and reunite with their families.\n\n“We longed for the comfort of our families and the safety of our homes. The thought of never seeing them again haunted us every day,” Mr Sufiyan said, tightly holding onto his brother Mohammad Salman who, along with his parents and others, were at the airport to receive him.\n\nThe sight of other “soldiers” dropping dead only added to their trauma.\n\n“Hamil, a very good friend of mine from Gujarat, was blown to death in a drone attack. He was part of a team of 24 soldiers, including one Indian and one Nepali. It shook me up,” recalled Mr Sufiyan.\n\nHamil’s death became the catalyst for them to alert their families about the situation, who then reached out to India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar who facilitated their rescue.\n\nRussia’s military has discharged 45 Indian nationals who were misled into fighting in the war against Ukraine, India’s Foreign Ministry said recently, adding that efforts were underway to release 50 more Indian soldiers.\n\nThe Indian nationals were able to return home after Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised their plight with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow in July, according to media reports.\n\nAt least four Indians have been killed in Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nIndia’s domestic crime investigation agency says around 100 Indian nationals fell victim to human traffickers who lured people to Russia with job offers or admission to “dubious private universities”.\n\nIn May, Indian authorities arrested four people implicated in the trafficking network. Those arrests came after investigators carried out raids across 13 locations in India and detained several people for questioning.\n\nAt least 91 Indian nationals have ended up serving Russia on the front lines, and of those, eight have died, according to India’s foreign ministry.\n\nMr Syed Ilias Hussaini from Karnataka who said he saw his friends die on the front lines and feared for his life every day.\n\nPhoto:\n\n“Every day we woke up not knowing if it would be our last.

Anjaneyulu, former Vijayawada Police Commissioner Kanthi Rana Tata and former Vijayawada Deputy Commissioner Vishal Gunni proceeded with the arrest of Jethwani in Mumbai on Feb 2, allegedly without written orders or sufficient evidence.\n\nThe suspended officers arrested her soon after a first information report was registered, raising concerns of procedural irregularities.\n\nTheir actions displayed disregard for standard investigative protocols, according to their suspension orders, which were issued based on a report by the Director-General of Police (DGP) Dwarka Tirumala Rao and signed by Chief Minister N.

They were kept in judicial custody for over 40 days before being granted bail.\n\nJethwani alleged that she and her family were subjected to mental torture and humiliation by police during questioning.\n\nHer lawyer N. Srinivas alleged that Mr Vidyasagar had fabricated land documents to frame Jethwani and her family, and that police did not allow them to file a bail plea for several days.\n\nA government order detailing DGP Anjaneyulu’s suspension stated that disciplinary proceedings have been initiated due to “prima facie evidence” of “grave misconduct and dereliction of duty”.\n\nThe inquiry that led to the suspensions of the police officers was initiated by DGP Rao after Jethwani lodged a formal complaint online with the Andhra Pradesh police.\n\nShe personally recorded her statement with the Vijayawada police on Aug 30 detailing the harassment she and her family endured.\n\nHome Minister V.

R. Rahman during the 1990s.\n\nPhotos: Mohamed Raffee\n\nAnusha Selvamani\n\nIn the realm of Indian music, few collaborations are as coveted as sharing the stage with music maestro A. R. Rahman.\n\nFor local musician Mohamad Raffee, that very dream became a reality for the second time when he received an unexpected call from Rahman just a day before the latter’s concert in Singapore on Aug 31.\n\nWith less than 24 hours to the concert, the home-grown veteran was asked to come down for rehearsals with the crew that was going to perform alongside Rahman at the National Stadium.\n\nThe last time Raffee, 63, had the opportunity to perform at Rahman’s concert was more than two decades ago.\n\nOn Aug 31, in front of 25,000 spectators, Raffee was called out on stage to sing one of Rahman’s biggest hits – Jumbalaka.\n\n“I was not in the line-up of artists slated to perform with Rahman. The audience didn’t expect to see me on stage. I was so glad that I managed to hug and fist bump him,” Raffee told tabla!\n\nRaffee’s friendship with Rahman, an Oscar and Grammy winner, goes back several decades.\n\nHe was introduced to Rahman by his younger brother Mohamad Bashir – also a musician – who worked in India during the 1980s.\n\n“In 1989, I bumped into Rahman on the streets and struck up a conversation with him. After that, I kept in touch with him regularly,”  recalled Raffee, who in those days would travel to India often in search of opportunities in the music industry.\n\n“In 1995 I decided to stay in India and work for a while. I contacted Rahman and asked if I could help him with his music. He was a budding artist back then.\n\n“One day, Rahman asked me to visit his studio – and the rest is history.”\n\nRahman offered Raffee the opportunity to sing Ennai Kanavillaiye Netrodu from the movie Kadhal Desam (1996). Though the song was eventually sung by playback singer SP Balasubrahmanyam as per the film crew’s request, Raffee was thrilled that Rahman used his voice for the chorus section of the song.\n\nA couple of years later, Raffee was invited back to Rahman’s studio again – this time to help produce and arrange a song, Jumbalaka, for an upcoming film soundtrack.\n\n“While working on the track, Rahman suddenly decided that I should sing the song instead,” Raffee said.\n\n“I asked Rahman if he was kidding, and he insisted that I should sing Jumbalaka. Who would have thought that the song would make me popular? Only Rahman can think up such sudden ideas.”\n\nRaffee remained in India for the next eight years with his wife, all the while helping to produce and arrange songs that Rahman – who by this time was a bonafide star in India’s music scene – composed and sang.\n\nNotable Tamil songs Raffee worked on include Sandhipoma, Hey Hey Enna Aachu, Kama Kama, Mayilarage, Maram Kothiye and Solli Tharava.\n\nHe also ventured into Hindi music and worked on songs from the movies Taal, Rang De Basanti and Pukar.\n\nDescribing his working relationship with Rahman, Raffee said: “Rahman loves to work at night as it’s very peaceful. We start around 10pm and call it ‘a day’ at 6.30am the next morning. Then we go for our morning prayers and come back to sleep.\n\n“I love all of Rahman’s songs, but my personal favourite is Nenje Nenje from the movie Ratchagan. The song has a deep meaning and I love the lyrics.”\n\nThough Raffee returned to Singapore in 2010, he constantly stays in touch with Rahman.\n\n“I’ve gone on meditation retreats with Rahman before. He goes to Melaka frequently and I sometimes tag along. Apart from music, we love to talk about spirituality,” said Raffee.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/63efb9032648f11c6aadd0d5a2f68761826d7153a4af955e59cf5e0b9bdb0a98?w=825", "alt_text": "Local musician Mohamad Raffee with A.

Many families were not so fortunate.\n\nAlthough in black and white then, TV was already a game changer by bringing scenes of significant events into living rooms.\n\nFor instance, on Aug 9, 1965, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore, cried during a televised press conference after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia.\n\nTelevision had captured a poignant moment in Singapore’s history – an eternal visual reminder of a leader’s concerns about the survival of his tiny nation venturing alone into the future.\n\nSoon after, we too had a TV at home and faithfully watched locally produced Malay “sandiwara” dramas, Hindi and Tamil movies and Western programmes.\n\nAs my father was rather conservative, we children would look away whenever there was a kissing scene. Shootings, stabbings and other violent behaviour were okay.\n\nOne programme the family would make sure never to miss was the inter-school English-language debates. It ran from 1969 to 1991 and featured participants who went on to become major public figures. These included politicians Vivian Balakrishnan and Ho Peng Kee and legal eagles Walter Woon and Edmond Pereira.\n\nColour TV sets appeared in May 1974 but my parents saw it as an unnecessary expense.\n\nOur neighbours thought otherwise, especially after it was announced that Singapore would broadcast the World Cup final live, in colour, on July 7 that year.\n\nI remember watching the game at home in black and white. I was 21 years old and too embarrassed to head over to my neighbour’s house to watch Holland v West Germany in colour.\n\nDue to budgetary constraints, Radio & Television Singapore, or RTS – Singapore’s first TV station – often repeated programmes and aired reruns of old sitcom episodes, so many of us dubbed it “Repeat Television Station”.\n\nWe were convinced it was why RTS was later renamed the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. Today, it is called MediaCorp.\n\nIn the 1990s, my family members would gather in front of the TV set and watch shows such as Under One Roof, Growing Up and Phua Chu Kang.\n\nToday, everyone is viewing their favourite content – whether it be on YouTube, Netflix or social media platforms – on their own personal device.\n\nIn most homes, the TV is for only grandpa and grandma. How times have changed.\n\nBy Khush Randhawa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/88d9a487d789f6801be516f4b05908b54bface17b6c3dd7fa5dd067da8979cb5?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

But, before that, Bengaluru-based distribution house KVN Productions announced on Friday that he has signed on to do one more film.\n\nAccording to the Hindustan Times, Vijay will complete his 69th film before entering politics with his newly formed party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (Tamil Nadu Victory Federation).\n\nThe 50-year-old actor, born Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar and known simply as Vijay, founded the party earlier this year and serves as its president.\n\nKVN Productions shared a compilation of Vijay’s scenes from his hit films on X without showing his face, and wrote: “We all grew up with your films & you’ve been a part of our lives every step of the way. Thank you Thalapathy for entertaining us for more than 30 years.”\n\nOn Saturday, KVN dropped the first-look poster of the film, tentatively titled Thalapathy 69. The poster showed a hand holding a torch with a line on top: “The torchbearer of democracy… arriving soon.”\n\nThe film will be directed by H. Vinoth, with music composed by Anirudh. It will be produced by Venkat K. Narayana, with Jagadish Palanisamy and Lohith N.K. as co-producers.\n\nThe post’s caption read: ‘We are beyond proud & excited to announce that our first Tamil film is #Thalapathy69, directed by the visionary #HVinoth, with music by the sensational Rockstar @anirudhofficial Super happy to collaborate with the one and only #Thalapathy @actorvijay. The torch bearer of democracy is arriving in Oct 2025.”\n\nThroughout the day, the term “one last dance” began trending on X, with fans excited to learn more about Vijay’s swan song.\n\nMany others also shared clips from their favourite films of his with the hastag #onelastdance.\n\nVijay debuted as a lead actor in the 1992 film Naalaiya Theerpu and soon became one of the biggest stars in Tamil cinema.\n\nThrough the years, he acted in hits like Coimbatore Mappillai, Love Today, Kushi and Ghilli. He was most recently seen in Venkat Prabhu’s The Greatest of All Time (GOAT), which was released in theatres on Sept 5.\n\nGOAT is enjoying a successful theatrical run, grossing over Rs10 crore ($1.5 million) on its 10th day in Tamil Nadu and accumulating an estimated total of Rs162 crore in the state.

The songs I used to listen to growing up, I think they sort of wake up the childhood neurons of my brain.”\n\nIt’s one of many Indian traits Mr Mahbubani proudly possesses, amid an otherwise quintessentially Singaporean persona and outlook.\n\nHe is quick to remind me of this when I ask what it was like growing up in Singapore as a minority within a minority – Mr Mahbubani is of Hindu Sindhi descent.\n\n“The paradox about my life is that, for some strange reason, many of my best friends are Singaporean Chinese,” he says.\n\n“And I mentioned that in chapter one (of my memoirs), where my oldest friend, Jeffrey Seung, remembers me going to the coffee shop to bring my father home after he had been fighting with a broken beer bottle. So I’ve had very old Chinese friends. Of course, I do have Indian friends too.”\n\nMr Mahbubani’s autobiography chronicles his difficult, impoverished childhood and journey from a textile salesman in his late teens to serving as Singapore’s permanent representative to the United Nations between 1984 and 1989, and again between 1998 and 2004.\n\nHe later also served as president of the United Nations Security Council between 2001 and 2002. A large part of the book is devoted to his views on governance and international diplomacy.\n\nThe second of four children, Mr Mahbubani writes about how his father struggled with drinking and gambling habits, and was ultimately jailed for nine months for criminal breach of trust after he gambled away some of his employer’s money.\n\n“Even though my sisters and I resented (and sometimes hated) our father when we were young, I came to forgive him when I understood that life had dealt him a very bad hand,” he writes.\n\nHis mother Janki was the family’s stabilising force. Her mantra to the children was: Even though poor, they must not reveal this or complain about it.\n\n“In her words, ‘even if you are feeling hungry, don’t show it. Put butter on your lips and smile’,” he writes. “For a large part of my life, I walked around with deep insecurities while smiling with metaphorical butter on my lips to give the impression that all was well.”\n\nWorking as a textile salesman for $150 a month, Mr Mahbubani’s life took a fateful turn when he was awarded the President’s Scholarship in 1967 to study at the then University of Singapore. The scholarship came with a government bond, and he joined the Foreign Ministry in 1971.\n\nHe rose quickly. Two years later, when he was 24, he became charge d’affaires of the Singapore embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Postings to the Singapore missions in Kuala Lumpur and Washington soon followed.\n\nIn 1984, when he was just 35, Mr Mahbubani succeeded Professor Tommy Koh as Singapore’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York.\n\nLater, he became permanent secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in 2004, entered the realm of academia when he became the founding dean of the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\nHis books on geopolitics – he has penned 10 to date – and the articles he has written in international media have made him a sought-after commentator on Asia’s rise.\n\nI pose a question to him on the influx of immigrants to Singapore and the government’s stance on the matter, which is controversial to say the least among some quarters. I cite a recent quote from Prime Minister Lawrence Wong who spoke about Singapore as an open society, where he also said there are “house rules” for immigrants living and working here.\n\nBut just what do these “house rules” entail?\n\n“What he meant by that is that we are a multiracial society where we show a lot of respect for the other communities,” Mr Mahbubani says.\n\n“Do you remember the famous play by Alfian Sa’at, Cook A Pot Of Curry? It’s about how a Chinese family that arrives in Singapore complains about the curry smell emanating from their Indian neighbours’ home.\n\n“And then over time, the Chinese family adjusts to it. So I think that’s what it means – respect for other communities.”\n\nHe continues: “And that’s something that many who come to Singapore don’t understand and appreciate, right? In my memoirs, I describe how my mother arrived in Singapore having had a close escape from Pakistan, with a lot of antipathy towards Muslims.\n\n“And she ended up falling in love with our Malay-Muslim neighbours. So that’s the story of Singapore, and that doesn’t happen in many countries in the world.\n\n“Singapore is unusual; in parts of the West now, there is less tolerance of diversity. Singapore has always been tolerant of diversity, but also very disciplined – that each community must treat the other community with respect.”\n\nThough Mr Mahbubani is retired from active roles, he remains busier than ever giving speeches around the world. He has already visited the United States four times this year, and plans on heading back there twice more before December. It helps, of course, that his 36-year-old daughter resides in New York, a city Mr Mahbubani regards as his “second home” having lived there for a decade.\n\nHe also has one son living in Pittsburgh and another in London.\n\nHaving travelled to more countries than he can remember, including parts of Africa and even Antarctica (he was on a cruise, and curiously insists it wasn’t that cold), he tells me he has yet to visit the Grand Canyon in Arizona.\n\n“I have to get there before I get too old,” he says with a smile.\n\nBefore I leave his office, I gaze at a shelf where a framed photograph sits of Mr Mahbubani being received by former US president Ronald Reagan at the United Nations. On the wall behind his desk is another photo of him with former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan.\n\n“Who surprised you the most, in all your travels?” I ask.\n\n“That’s a tough one, but I would say Narendra Modi,” he replies after some thought.\n\n“I met him when I was chairman of the nominating committee of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, and Ahmedabad was shortlisted, so we went there to meet him.\n\n“He was by far the most disciplined person I’ve met. He sat down with us and spent two hours just talking non-stop, describing very clearly what Ahmedabad was doing, what his vision for the city was and what his dream was.\n\n“And, you know, we had gone to so many cities, met so many mayors, governors and chief ministers, and he was by far the most hardworking and most disciplined person.”\n\nOne wonders what music Prime Minister Modi listens to as he runs the country.\n\nKishore Mahbubani and his mother after his graduation from the University of Singapore.\n\nPHOTO: COURTESY OF KISHORE MAHBUBANI\n\n“The songs I used to listen to growing up, I think they sort of wake up the childhood neurons of my brain.”\n\nKishore Mahbubani (left) on his penchant for listening to Mohammed Rafi songs while writing", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9f6841048061d4041c05f5f64c519202022290e485fe866a2ed83362b978005f?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The installation features a joyful family of four, symbolising the festival’s focus on togetherness and harmony.\n\nWhile the kaleidoscope of coloured lights will permeate every street and shop in the Little India district for the next two months, behind-the-scenes of this light-up is a feat not known to many.\n\nThe entire installation process took about two months to complete, with crews working tirelessly to ensure everything was ready on time.\n\nThis year, the final touches were completed at midnight on the eve of the light-up ceremony. The planning, however, began much earlier – almost immediately after last year’s event.\n\nOver the course of 10 months, a new committee was formed, overseeing every aspect of the celebration, from events and logistics to design and sustainability initiatives.\n\n“We brainstorm ideas that we want to explore and sometimes even get help from schools and students, whose artwork often inspires our themes,” said Mr Regunarth Siva, chairman of the Little India Shop Owners and Heritage Association (LISHA).\n\n“This year, the idea of family unity really struck a chord. A lot of the art we saw from students reflected the importance of spending time with family, and we felt that this was something we wanted to highlight.”\n\nThe ongoing roadworks at Race Course Road have limited the extension of the lights for a second consecutive year. Despite this, organisers have made strides in promoting sustainability. This year marks the first time that Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are being used throughout the display to save energy.\n\n“We want to promote a sustainable Deepavali,” said Mr Regunarth, who estimated that using LED lights reduced the costs involved by 10-15 per cent.\n\n“The LED lights are just the start. We’re also reducing plastic usage by reusing backdrops from previous celebrations, like Pongal and last year’s Deepavali. It’s important to find more ways to reduce our environmental footprint.”\n\nThe installation process itself is meticulous, taking about three weeks to complete. Permits from various government agencies must be secured before work can begin, and everything must be carefully coordinated to ensure that the display is safe.\n\nMadam Chellama, 84, who went around Little India with her daughter-in-law on Sept 14 to “soak in the lights”, said the LED lights were “no less illuminating” than previous years.\n\n“Events like these reflect on the community’s efforts to not just celebrate Deepavali but also to urge youngsters to embrace their heritage and culture,” she said.\n\n“Every year, the light-ups get a bit better, and that should be the way.”\n\nApart from the light-up, 12 fringe activities have also been organised by Lisha to further enhance the festive atmosphere. Running from Sept 14 to Oct 3, the activities include open-top double-decker bus tours and workshops to engage the public in celebrating the rich cultural heritage behind the festival of lights.\n\nMore information on the festivities can be found at www.deepavali.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/81718777bc5c46cfc06c8f5a392cbcef53a9d9a1d626cb949c47fdfd0b595b5e?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nMs Cerys Ong almost went into the Odissi performance blind.\n\nThe dancer, who trains at Chowk Productions, an Indian dance school in Aliwal Street, learnt she was going to perform before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi only a few hours before she stepped onto the outdoor stage on Sept 4.\n\n“We were asked to do a dance by the High Commission of India (HCI) just a few days before,” said Ms Raka Maitra, artistic director at Chowk. “They just told us that an Indian minister was coming to Singapore. They didn’t even tell us the venue until the last minute.”\n\nAs most of its leading dancers were busy, Ms Raka sent those who were available – Singaporeans Ms Ong, Ms Elizabeth Tan and Ms Wong Yong En – who all train at Chowk.\n\n“It was just a few minutes of an Odissi set-piece – Mangala Charan – that we performed,” said Ms Ong. “It was the first set-piece I ever learnt. But it takes years to get into your body. You make it yours after learning it for many years.\n\n“Mr Modi watched our performance and was very happy. He asked us why we learn this traditional Indian dance form and who our guru is. We were thrilled that he spoke to us.”\n\nMr Modi was in Singapore on a two-day official visit and the HCI lined up two events to welcome him – including a dhol (drum) performance by the Maharashtra Mandal Singapore team – at Shangri-La Hotel.\n\n“There were around 200 people from the Indian diaspora there to greet Mr Modi and I was amazed by the way they adored their leader,” said Ms Ong, 29, a theatre practitioner who also teaches acting.\n\n“The way they cheered and praised him, it was an eye-opener. It was quite ethereal and fascinating.”\n\nMs Ong said she never thought she would get to perform before a leader of Mr Modi’s stature. So she did not really prepare for the occasion.\n\n“I never followed him as a leader, so I was not sure what he was like,” she said. “But I was not apprehensive or overwhelmed. I simply stood in awe of what was going on.”\n\nShe also appreciated Mr Modi’s showmanship when he asked for a dhol and beat it in rhythmic fashion.\n\n“It was a brilliant act,” said Ms Ong. “He seized the moment and people appreciated his effort. That is why he is such a charismatic leader.”\n\nOdissi is an ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the temples of Odisha – an eastern coastal state in India – and is a dance-drama genre of performance art where the artistes and musicians play out a story, spiritual message or devotional poem from the Hindu texts using symbolic costumes, body movement, abhinaya (expressions) and mudras (gestures and sign language) set out in ancient Sanskrit literature.\n\nMs Ong has been learning Odissi at Chowk for nine years. She and Ms Tan are theatre practitioners who use the dance for strengthening and flexibility, while Ms Wong is an opera singer and an associate artiste at Chowk.\n\n“At Chowk, we train our students in classical Odissi and then we use the form to create experimental work,” said Ms Raka, who in 2007 began teaching Odissi to a handful of expat and local students.\n\nMs Ong fell in love with Odissi when she was studying at the Intercultural Theatre Institute at Emily Hill in Rochor.\n\n“Chowk was next to our school and we used to do programme exchanges and workshops,” she said. “It’s Asian curriculum grew on me, I joined it, and the rest is history.”\n\nShe said she loves to train at Chowk “because there are no barriers even though I am not Indian”.\n\n“It’s a special place to me because everyone starts on the same page and grow together.”\n\n(From left) Ms Cerys Ong, Ms Elizabeth Tan and Ms Wong Yong En, who all train at Indian dance school Chowk Productions.\n\nPhoto: Vhok Jhon/HCI\n\n“The way they cheered and praised him, it was an eye-opener.

Sellvem, chairman of the Singapore Silent Heroes Award.\n\nPhoto: The Straits Times\n\nயோகிதா அன்புச்செழியன்\n\nShe was surrounded by peers who weren’t just dealing with academic stress but distress.\n\nAs the vice-head peer support leader at Cedar Girls’ Secondary School two years ago, Neyati Umamaheswar, 17, saw first-hand how mental health issues among students were often brushed aside, hidden beneath a veneer of academic focus.\n\nSuicide remains a major concern in Singapore. According to data from the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), 322 suicides were reported in 2023, a 32.4 per cent drop from 2022 when the highest number of suicides (476) was recorded since SOS began tracking data in 2000.\n\nAlthough the number of suicides among those aged 10 to 29 fell in 2023, it remained the leading cause of death in this group for the fifth consecutive year, accounting for 29.2 per cent of all deaths.\n\nNoticing the trend, Neyati felt there weren’t enough discussions on the subject of mental health.\n\n“I was lucky enough to have my parents as my support system when times were tough. But not everyone is aware of what young people and students are going through, and many don’t have that same support,” she told tabla!\n\n“When you’re deep in a mental illness, you may not even realise you have it and it’s not until the situation worsens that you even recognise something might be wrong.”\n\nIt was this realisation that spurred her into action. In 2022, at just 15 years old, Neyati founded Minds Untangled – a student-led initiative aimed at educating students in identifying the warning signs of mental health issues and encouraging them to seek professional help.\n\nTwo years on, Neyati’s vision for Minds Untangled has grown beyond her secondary school. The initiative now seeks to create more open dialogues about mental health challenges faced by those aged 13 to 20, and is even expanding its reach globally.\n\nFor her efforts, she received two awards this year. In July, Neyati was one of 53 students awarded the Singapore Silent Heroes (SSH) Student Award by the Civilians Association Singapore (CAS) in recognition of their contributions to the community.\n\nLast week, she also received the APEX Student Award at the SSH Awards 2024, presented by Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung. This award was given to six students who demonstrated exceptional leadership and empathy among the 53 SSH award recipients.\n\nNeyati shared that Minds Untangled began as a small group of like-minded students at Cedar Girls’, where she and 11 other schoolmates formed the core team.\n\n“Our target is youths aged 13 to 20 because that’s such a crucial period where many are transitioning into adolescence or from adolescence to adulthood, and it’s when mental health struggles often begin to emerge,” she said.\n\n“We want to foster a community where youths can find solace, express themselves and navigate the often-overlooked challenges of mental health.”\n\nWhat started as a modest effort to raise awareness has since grown into a larger organisation with 60 members, including students from her current school, Victoria Junior College, and international volunteers from countries such as Brazil, Taiwan and India.\n\nThe volunteers help to research, curate and create content for their website and social media platforms, which help provide youth with access to reliable mental health resources, said Dharnitha Aravindhan, 17, vice-president of Minds Untangled.\n\n“I think right now, people rely on social media and easily accessible platforms for mental health advice, but there’s a lot of false information out there,” Dharnitha added.\n\n“By no means does Minds Untangled claim to be a perfectly reliable alternative, but we try our best to ensure we share accurate research from trusted sources.”\n\nOne of the first things Neyati and her team did as a part of their outreach efforts was organise informal events where youth could come together, talk openly and find support among each other.\n\nAs these small-scale events gained traction, the team explored other approaches. In November 2023, they hosted an art therapy session attended by 30 youths who shared and discussed their paintings and clay models. For Neyati, the success of the event was more than just the turnout – it was the impact.\n\n“Two students came up to me after the session and told me how much the event had helped them calm down during a particularly stressful time,” Neyati said. “They were about to get their exam results, and the art therapy session gave them a much-needed break.”\n\n“Moments like those that made me feel we were truly making a difference.”\n\nBuilding on this momentum, Minds Untangled expanded its initiatives to include partnerships with other organisations. This year, it partnered with Pat-A-Cat, a cafe that fosters cats.\n\n“We believe that spending time with animals can bring a lot of joy, and we wanted to offer that experience to help reduce stress and promote well-being,” Neyati said.\n\nAs Minds Untangled continues to grow in numbers, so do its ambitions. The organisation has already expanded its volunteer base internationally.\n\n“The aim now is to establish regional teams in different countries that can tailor their efforts to address specific local mental health challenges,” she said.\n\n“We want to foster a community where youths can find solace, express themselves and navigate the often-overlooked challenges of mental health.”\n\nNeyati Umamaheswar who created Minds Untangled, an initiative aimed at educating students on mental health issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0c3f379534e6f46d640ea282b8077b23c02905ad57366f78d08f8f5a44cdc7c3?w=825", "alt_text": "Neyati Umamaheswar receiving her award from Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung; with them is Mr M.P.

Karthikeyan\n\nAnusha Selvamani\n\nWhen Dr Simon Mahendran was about to open his dental clinic one morning in the early 1990s, he saw a group of migrant workers sleeping on the floor near the entrance.\n\nThey weren’t sick or anything of the sort, they just didn’t have a place to sleep at night.\n\nMoved by this, the 62-year-old Singaporean felt he needed to help the workers any way he could, and soon after, set subsidised rates for foreign workers who needed dental services at his clinic.\n\nDr Simon has been running the Simon Dental Surgery in Chander Road at Little India since 1988. It’s a place he says that is “familiar to many migrant workers”. Beyond providing dental services, he also listens to their grievances and about the challenges they face at their workplace.\n\n“I feel sorry whenever they share the problems they face at home and the challenges they face at the workplace,” said Dr Simon, a father of four.\n\nIn 1994, Dr Simon established the Karunya Community Clinic – also in Chander Road – offering migrant workers affordable healthcare delivered by a team of pro-bono doctors on Thursday and Sunday evenings. The clinic sees an average of 70 patients every week.\n\n“I wanted to expand my volunteer service. Just providing dental services at subsidised rates was not enough. The workers also have various medical problems and they’re afraid to go to the hospital due to the hefty bills they have to pay,” Dr Simon said.\n\n“I was not able to do this alone. I had to enlist the help of my friends who are doctors and also other volunteers to help run Karunya.”\n\nMr Solomon Joseph, 69, who has been volunteering at Karunya since its opening, said: “I help with translation whenever the workers struggle to understand what the doctor says. I get emotional when the workers receive the service and say thank you.”\n\nDr Simon also started a non-profit organisation called Jeevan Frontiers in 1996, where volunteers offer advice and moral support to help migrant workers overcome numerous challenges – from mental health and debt issues to chronic health conditions and alcohol addiction.\n\nDr Simon said some migrant workers have volunteered at Jeevan Frontiers as well. “It warms my heart when I serve the workers first, and then they serve others like themselves later on,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aa8d07cf3cc8b666b5f0e42923794af34f1a161b9700d84cd0f64c0123a9b9c8?w=825", "alt_text": "Dr Simon Mahendran."}]}

The new agreement would deepen existing areas of cooperation and enable new areas.\n\nDetails of the economic agreements that would enhance the partnership have been widely publicised. What is important is to sense the implications for Singapore’s and India’s place in the flux of international affairs.\n\nLet us begin with the historical perspective. Both countries are products of the period of decolonisation that followed World War II. Both achieved independence through the largely peaceful transfer of power from the British. Their adherence to this day to the rule of law and parliamentary democracy is derived from their political experience of colonialism.\n\nTheir international paths diverged during the Cold War, with non-aligned India veering close to the erstwhile Soviet Union and non-aligned Singapore hewing a more centrist line in global affairs. Singapore’s views were vindicated when the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, leaving the global terrain exposed to the expansion of what is known as the liberal international order, in which the world is safer the freer trade is.\n\nIndia came to embrace that order in its essentials with the liberalisation of its economy in the 1990s. Singapore welcomed that development, which reintroduced India as a major power in global affairs, to the extent that former prime minister Narasimha Rao of India announced his country’s Look East policy (since upgraded to the Act East policy) here in 1994.\n\nThirty years since then, India has globalised itself with a vengeance. Today, the India Story is sounding similar to the China Story, in which the political desire for economic change uplifts millions out of poverty and marginalisation in a fraction of the time that it took the West to achieve the same incremental improvements.\n\nSingapore is associated closely with the China Story. Chinese supremo Deng Xiaoping’s visit to the city-state in 1978 opened his eyes to what was possible back home on a vastly larger scale should China look outwards.\n\nIn short, Singapore is an economic interlocutor for much larger and more powerful Asian nations in their strategic relations with the rest of the world. Singapore’s anchored and anchoring place in Asean gives this country the regional heft with which to argue for economics as an underpinning of peace. Singapore is a trading state, after all.\n\nToday, the global order based on the twin legs of prosperity and peace, from which both India and Singapore benefit, is under pressure.  A wide-ranging joint statement touched on one source of tension: the South China Sea. It underlined the need to maintain and promote “peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea, while pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), without resorting to the threat or use of force”. The rejection of force is an explicit concern.\n\nThe South China Sea is an arena where the maritime claims of the contending parties – Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam – overlap dangerously with the great-power rivalry between China and the United States. Given the sea’s crucial position in world trade, it is natural for countries such as India and Singapore to be concerned about the consequences of the waterway turning into a flashpoint of armed conflict.\n\nIn the circumstances, it does help for like-minded countries to reaffirm their joint commitment to a global system in which nations both large and small can survive and thrive.\n\nThe Modi visit contributed to that vision.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2c89cc3b4af7fdaa25a886a452be1232f56f919a8219c81d6b14b573723b5e07?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian and Singapore ministers and officials at Parliament House on Sept 5."}]}

A few months after returning to the ring, the right-handed boxer had won the Singapore Boxing Federation national championships.\n\n“After winning the nationals, Thariq was called back to the national team and he was really excited about it,” Syakir, 32, said. “But he was unable to juggle national training and his job. That’s when we decided that turning pro would suit him better. Professional boxers train according to their own schedule rather than a fixed time with the rest of the team.”\n\nTurning pro means Thariq joins a select few active professional boxers (15 as per Hamzah’s estimate) in Singapore.\n\nHamzah, 36, himself a former WBC Asia Champion with a 14-1 win-loss record as a professional boxer, knows the challenges that lie ahead for Thariq.\n\nFor one, a professional boxer needs to adapt to fighting up to 12 three-minute rounds, compared with three rounds for amateur fights.\n\nAnd, finances are always on a boxer’s mind.\n\nHamzah said: “It’s a misconception that professional boxing pays a lot. Ninety per cent of pro boxers all over the world have day jobs, so they have to struggle to pursue their dream. Only if you’re lucky and skilled enough do you get the big fights and the big money.”\n\nHamzah stressed that sacrifices have to be made.\n\nFor his pro debut, Thariq trained for four months – five times a week and three times a day – way longer and more intensely than usual.\n\n“If you want to go pro, making money or climbing the corporate ladder has to take a backseat as boxing is demanding. You might need to take a job that doesn’t pay as well but gives you extra time to train. I myself had to take up a job as a trainer and even paused my education.”\n\nCurrently, Thariq, who used to save his pocket money as a student to pay for his training fees, works part-time as a personal trainer to sustain himself.\n\n“I need to sponsor my own sports massages, injury treatment and even diet,” he explained. “If I have more sponsors, it will help me focus more on training.”\n\nThariq’s first pro fight on Aug 17 bagged him $400 – the prize money will increase as he racks up more wins. He also gets a commission from ticket sales at his fights.\n\nSyakir said there is a high possibility of Thariq fighting overseas next year. For now though, he is set to fight at The Chevrons on Oct 26, representing Brothers Boxing Promotions.\n\n“In my career as a professional boxer, I want to win at least one belt,” Thariq said. “If I can do better than that, it would be a dream come true.”\n\nThariq Aziz, 25, won on his debut as a professional boxer against Indonesian fighter Johan Sigalingging in the 60kg class on Aug 17 at the ‘Test of Champions’ competition at Foochow Building.\n\nPhoto: Fiona Lim\n\n“It’s a misconception that professional boxing pays a lot.

He first took selfies with the poisonous snake before proceeding to shoot videos – probably with the aim of posting them on Instagram.\n\nIn one video, he is seen standing in the middle of a road and putting the cobra inside his mouth.

This is because India’s biggest source of hilsa supply, Bangladesh, has decided not to export the popular fish to India.\n\nHilsa, also known as ilish, is the national fish of Bangladesh, but it is a luxury, affordable only for the rich and middle class.\n\nThe country produces around 70 per cent of the world’s supply. In 2012, Bangladesh banned the export of the fish, citing a shortage of supply.\n\nHowever, then Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made an exemption for India in 2019 and allowed the export of 500 metric tonnes of hilsa to India. This increased to 1,850 metric tonnes in 2020.\n\nThe consignment of hilsa from Bangladesh used to reach India ahead of the Durga Puja festival, when it is in high demand. This was often referred to as Ms Hasina’s “hilsa diplomacy”.\n\nMs Hasina has sent hilsa to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on a number of occasions. Hoping to resolve a long-standing water dispute, she also gifted 30kg of the fish to then Indian president Pranab Mukherjee in 2017.\n\nMs Hasina was dramatically removed from power on Aug 5 after weeks of student-led protests that escalated into deadly nationwide unrest. Initially expected to stay in India briefly, her attempts to secure asylum in the UK, US and UAE have so far failed.\n\nHer continued presence in India has also complicated Delhi’s efforts to build a strong relationship with the new interim government in Dhaka. For India, Bangladesh is a key strategic partner and ally, vital for border security, especially in its north-eastern states.\n\nNow the supply of hilsa to India has come to an end with her ouster from power. The interim government in Bangladesh, led by Mr Muhammad Yunus, has decided not to export the fish.\n\nAdviser to the Bangladesh Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Farida Akhter said the government has imposed a ban to ensure sufficient supply for local consumers.\n\n“We cannot allow ilish to be exported while our own people cannot buy them. This year, I have instructed the Ministry of Commerce to prevent any ilish exports to India during Durga Puja,” Ms Akhter told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\n“The previous government would lift the ban during the Durga Puja festival. They used to call it a gift. This time I don’t think we need to give a gift because (if we do it) our people will not be able to eat the fish while it is allowed to be exported to India in large numbers,” Ms Akhter told the BBC.\n\n“A lot of fish is still going from Bangladesh to India despite the ban. This time we will not allow the hilsa to cross the border.”\n\nAsked whether the new interim government could have made a goodwill gesture to India by allowing supply of hilsa, Ms Akhter said: “We will have goodwill gestures in all other ways. They are our friends. But we should not do anything by depriving our people. The question of goodwill is separate from this.”\n\nHilsa holds an almost sacred status among Bengalis on both sides of the border, and its scarcity will frustrate many.\n\nThe fish is celebrated for its versatility, often cooked in a variety of ways such as steamed with mustard paste, which enhances its delicate flavour, or fried with a light coating of spices for a crispy texture.\n\nRight before the Durga Puja in October, Bengalis love to feast on hilsa paired with khichuri (a rice and lentils dish).\n\nBengali-American food historian and author Chitrita Banerji is among the many writers who have raved about the fish.\n\n“I think its enduring role as an icon of Bengali food is a combination of many elements, not the least being its physical beauty, which has led Bengali writers to describe it as the darling of the waters or a prince among fish,” she told an interviewer.\n\n“And its tender flesh (bony though it may be), combined with an emollient texture and exquisite flavour, lends itself to an infinite variety of culinary preparations.”\n\nFollowing the new military-backed government’s ban on hilsa exports, Indian will have to rely on alternative supplies from Odisha, Myanmar and Gujarat.\n\n“Traders at Gazipur wholesale market have told us that hilsa from Bangladesh is now being routed via Myanmar,” a fish seller at New Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park Market 1 said.\n\n“This has pushed up prices. We are selling a 1.3-kg hilsa from Bangladesh for Rs2,400 a kilo now. The price was between Rs1,800 and Rs2,000 a kilo a few months ago.”\n\n“We cannot allow (hilsa) to be exported while our own people cannot buy them.”\n\nAdviser to the Bangladesh Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Farida Akhter", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7d24e98a815762d94f403f4fea4f61ffd332dbdb67bed974b0cb12a25e89510d?w=825", "alt_text": "A vendor displaying a hilsa fish at a market in Dhaka, Bangladesh."}]}

China put pressure on the Indian defence, but Harmanpreet Singh’s men held on.\n\n“It was a tough tournament for us, but a good one in the end,” Fulton, 49, said after the match. “We had to find a way to win and that’s what we did. China put up a really good fight.”\n\nLast month, India won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics after beating Spain 2-1 in the third-place playoff.\n\nFulton said that after a hectic few months, he and the players now need a break. “It has been a roller-coaster,” Fulton said. “I need a younger group, and new players to give an opportunity to.\n\n“We need to broaden our depth. We will have another camp in 10 days and another 20 players will come for that. We are looking forward to the future and beyond. This was the first step. It’s a new-look team.”\n\nIndia had an excellent Asian Champions campaign, especially during the league phase where they won all five matches. In the semi-final, they took down South Korea  4-1, after which they got the better of China in the final.\n\nWith Fulton’s next focus set on qualifying for the 2026 World Cup in Belgium and the Netherlands, the South African is geared towards building a squad that has a healthy mix of both youth and experience.\n\n“You need experience to play in certain positions, but it’s not a prerequisite,” he explained. “You just need speed, fitness and skill because that’s the modern game at the moment.”\n\nThe formula around which Fulton aims to shape the squad is the one which worked wonderfully well in Paris.\n\nLed by experienced defender Harmanpreet and goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh, the forward line of young talents Abhishek Nain and Sukhjeet Singh were a threat for any defence they faced. Although midfielders Lalit Kumar Upadhyay and Mandeep Singh were not prolific in scoring, their level-headedness and high work rate allowed for the attackers to surge forward.\n\nBut coaching the Indian team is like skating on thin ice. Over the years, many reputed coaches have shied away from taking the job.\n\nAustralian Graham Reid was shown the door after the team’s poor showing at the 2023 World Cup. Fulton took the bold decision to step into Reid’s shoes, knowing any slip-up in Paris would put his job at risk.\n\nHaving come onboard less than three months before the Asian Games, a qualifier for the Paris Games, Fulton has done well so far.\n\n“I think the toughest assignment was to qualify for the Olympics after being with the team for just three months,” he said. “It’s been challenging to get to know the players and their strengths.

Shooting is slated to begin later this year.\n\nIf his final foray is anything like GOAT, Vijay is set for a remarkable swansong.\n\nThe formula for GOAT isn’t groundbreaking by any means – it follows the age-old template of a revenge story where a villain seeks revenge on a hero who destroyed his life years before.\n\nBut what makes the movie special is director Venkat Prabhu’s treatment of the plot, the screenplay which is riddled with funny references of old movies, the music and various cameos by Shivakartikeyan, YG Mahendran and an AI version of the late actor Captain Vikayakanth.\n\nThe movie begins with M.S Gandhi (Vijay) engaging in a sting operation in Kenya with his team from the special anti-terrorism squad, comprising Ajay Govindharaj (Ajmal Ameer), Kalyan Sundaram (Prabhu Deva) and Sunil Thiagarajan (Prashanth), to recover stolen uranium from a terrorist group on a train – where he unexpectedly finds Rajiv Menon (Mohan) who is on the run after being accused of treason.\n\nIn the process of retrieving the uranium and capturing Rajiv, the train is blasted and Rajiv is believed to be dead.\n\nOnce the team is back in India, Gandhi is forced to bring his pregnant wife, Anuradha (Sneha), and son, Jeevan (Akhil) along with him for his next mission in Thailand, where things head south and the couple lose their son.\n\nThis leads to them living separate lives back in Chennai years later, taking turns to dote on their daughter, Jeevitha (Abyuktha).\n\nGandhi lives a quiet life till he is convinced by his peers to lead an immigration training project in Moscow where he ends up seeing his son, also played by Vijay, and brings him back to India to reconnect with the family.\n\nHowever, Gandhi starts losing all his loved ones upon the arrival of Jeevan.\n\nThe question of whether Jeevan really is Gandhi’s son and what the young man’s role is in the mysterious deaths happening around him drives the rest of the story.\n\nWhile the plot is generally predictable, Venkat Prabhu adds a few twists and turns to the story, which keeps the audience engaged despite the three-hour runtime.\n\nAs far as performances go, acting as a 50-year-old and a 21-year-old was certainly testament to Vijay’s acting prowess.\n\nThe de-ageing tech used for Vijay worked for the most part, save for one sequence where he was shown as a teenager.\n\nThe movie leans heavily on Vijay’s performance, and indeed it is the actor’s sheer charisma that carries the audience throughout the three-hour runtime.\n\nFor fans of Vijay, GOAT is a must-watch. At the very least, to savour the last vestiges of a fine actor.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/03a3a0f48fd06775d0b5187883515ffcb66c96733c02f1f2bc9d6c0d088487ff?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

By the time we realised what was happening, they had taken her away,”  her mother Sunita told the BBC.\n\nSandhya’s body was found lying in the sugarcane farms the next day, some 500m from her home.\n\nEarlier in the month, in a neighbouring village, eight-year-old Utkarsh was sleeping under a mosquito net when his mother spotted a wolf creeping into their hut.\n\n“The animal lunged from the shadows. I screamed, ‘Leave my son alone!’ My neighbours rushed in, and the wolf fled,” she recounts.\n\nIn the latest attack on Wednesday night, a 50-year-old woman was severely injured.\n\nMs Pushpa Devi was attacked while asleep at her hut in Raipur Korean Tepra village, reported NDTV.\n\n“The incident took place at 10pm when she was sleeping. One of the children might have opened the door and the wolf was hiding somewhere. It came and grabbed her by the throat,” her relative was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.\n\n“The family members heard her cry and ran towards her. The people in the neighbourhood also gathered and then the wolf ran away.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, an 11-year-old girl was injured after a wolf attacked her. According to local media reports, she has been admitted to the government hospital in Mahasi for treatment.\n\nFear and hysteria have gripped the affected villages. With many homes lacking locks, children are being kept indoors and men are patrolling the darkly lit streets at night. Authorities have deployed drones and cameras, set traps and used firecrackers to scare away the wolves.\n\nThere is only speculation about what has suddenly made wolves so aggressive to the point that they have begun invading human settlements, terrorising some 15,000 people across 50 villages of Mahsi Tehsil in Bahraich since mid-April.\n\n“This aggressive behaviour of wolves is not normal. Rabies infection increases the aggression of wolves and thus the possibility of them being infected is there,” a forest officer told the Press Trust of India.\n\n“Medical tests must be conducted on the wolves that have been caught, so that it can be ascertained whether they are infected,” he said.\n\nDr A.M. Pawde, principal scientist at the Wildlife Centre of the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, said there is a possibility that wolves alone may not be behind all the attacks.\n\nHoney badgers, known as “kabra bijju” in local parlance, too might have been behind some of the attacks, he said.\n\n“The nature of the attack on at least one of the eight victims suggested a pattern different from what is left behind by wolves, who usually attack their prey from the toe or target a vein at the back of the leg,” Dr Pawde said.\n\n“But one of the Bahraich victims, a girl, had some part of her nose eaten away.”\n\nDr Pawde gave a possible reason why wolves may have suddenly begun attacking humans.\n\n“Wolves have a tendency to extract revenge. The Bahraich cases seem to be both revenge and growing human encroachment in wildlife forest space,” he said.\n\n“Wolves are extremely sensitive. The teams working on the field are now looking at the possibility of one of the wolves being lame, a possible consequence of it being assaulted by humans in the past.”\n\nAccording to sources in the forest department, Operation Bhedia, launched on July 17, has led to the capture of five out of the six wolves possibly behind the attacks.\n\nBahraich Divisional Forest Officer Ajit Pratap Singh said several teams, comprising 165 members in all, are engaged in wolf-hunting. The state government has also deployed nine shooters.\n\nRumour-mongering is not helping the forest department either.\n\n“Every evening, the forest department receives information about the presence of wolves at different places and all these tip-offs prove to be fake.\n\n“These days anyone getting injured is saying that injury was inflicted by a wild animal,” he said.\n\nDistrict Magistrate of Bahraich Monica Rani said the local administration is also installing doors in the houses of people who live in the affected areas.\n\nA fifth wolf was captured on Tuesday as part of the ongoing ‘Operation Bhediya’ in Bahraich.\n\nPhotos: PTI\n\n“Wolves have a tendency to extract revenge.

With unwavering support from her parents, Deepthi pursued running and brought glory to her nation.\n\nThe 20-year-old became the first intellectually impaired Indian athlete to win a Paralympic medal – a bronze in the women’s 400m T20 class.\n\nShe finished the race in 55.82 seconds, behind Ukraine’s Yulia Shuliar and Turkiye’s Ayser Onder, who crossed the line in 55.16s and 55.23s respectively.\n\nThe T20 class is reserved for athletes with intellectual impairments. Deepthi, India’s first-ever athlete in this category, faces cognitive challenges that affect her communication and understanding skills.\n\nShe told India Today that she was called “monkey” by her neighbours, who disapproved of her being born on the day of an eclipse.\n\nThe young athlete said her parents never paid heed to the mocking from the villagers and stood like a pillar in helping her realise her dreams.\n\n“I was born during an eclipse, so our neighbours kept speaking against me,” she said. “They called me monkey and advised my parents to abandon me or leave me at an orphanage.\n\n“But I ignored all the negativity and focused on my sport. It was my family’s support that helped me overcome these challenges and earn this medal.”\n\nHer parents Jeevanji Yadhagiri and Dhanalaxmi were daily-wage labourers who struggled to make ends meet. They owned half an acre of agricultural land, but financial difficulties forced them to sell it. Deepthi used the prize money from her Asian Para Games win to buy back the land and gift it to her parents.\n\nMrs Dhanalaxmi told The Indian Express: “She was born during the solar eclipse and her head was very small at birth along with the lips and nose being a bit unusual. Every villager who saw her and some of our relatives would call Deepthi pichi (mental) and kothi (monkey) and tell us to send her to an orphanage. Today, seeing her become the world champion in a far-off country proves that she is indeed a special girl.\n\n“When my husband’s father died, we had to sell the farm to make ends meet. My husband would earn Rs100 ($2) or Rs150 a day so there were days when I had to work to support our family, including Deepthi’s younger sister Amulya. Deepthi was always a calm child and spoke very little. But when the village kids would tease her, she would come home and cry. So I would make her sweet rice or, on some days, chicken and that’s what made her happy.”\n\nDeepthi’s athletic talent was first recognised by her school’s physical education teacher in Warangal. Coach Nagapuri Ramesh, who had previously coached national 100m champion Dutee Chand, saw her potential and encouraged her parents to send her to Hyderabad for training.\n\nDespite initial financial constraints, Ramesh ensured Deepthi received the necessary support, even covering her bus fare to Hyderabad.\n\nDeepthi’s hard work and dedication paid off as she excelled in athletics. She won the gold medal at the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Para Games, setting a new Asian record with a time of 56.69 seconds. She also claimed gold at the 2024 World Championships, setting a world record, which was later broken at the Paralympics.\n\n“Yes, I believe I have sent a message to those detractors. Because of this medal, my family and everyone now looks at me with so much pride,” she said. “I am very happy with this first medal at the Paralympics. My parents are also very proud.”\n\nAccording to news reports, the Telangana Government has announced a Rs1 crore ($155,000) cash reward and 418 sq m of land in Warangal to Deepthi for her achievements in Paris.\n\n“I was born during an eclipse, so our neighbours kept speaking against me.

They were from Kolkata, visiting their son and daughter-in-law who were working in Singapore. They said they would return to Kolkata after a month in Singapore.\n\nUnfortunately, we forgot to exchange phone numbers, so we lost track of them.\n\nI can only imagine how they spent their time in Singapore: Sightseeing, shopping and meeting their son and daughter-in-law’s friends – that’s typically what parents do when they visit their children abroad.\n\nI wonder if shopping in Singapore still holds the same appeal for Indian visitors as it did in the past.\n\nWhen I first arrived here in 1988, the late Lee Kuan Yew was prime minister. The MRT system covered only a small area, and Orchard Road had fewer shopping malls.\n\nThe Specialists’ Shopping Centre – the oldest mall in Orchard Road – was a popular hunting ground for tourists, especially the John Little store which sold bargain goods and winter clothing.\n\nThe modest-sized mall stood opposite Centrepoint, then the most prestigious mall, which housed Robinsons, Marks & Spencer and my favourite weekend haunt, Times Bookstore.\n\nThere was no Paragon or Ngee Ann City, just Tangs and Lucky Plaza at one end and Plaza Singapura at the other. Yet, Orchard Road was just as busy as it is today.\n\nMeanwhile in Little India, shoppers lugged around shiny suitcases, flitting in and out of old shophouses and hunting for bargains along the Serangoon Road stretch that flaunted all kinds of merchandise.\n\nThere was no Little India Arcade then, and people used pagers instead of handphones. But perhaps the most significant change for me is the absence now of Indian tourists lugging video cassette recorders (VCRs) and video cassette players (VCPs). Those were the must-buy items back then.\n\nFor such big-ticket items, they flocked to Mustafa, which was then located in Serangoon Plaza, a building now replaced by Centrium Square. Today, Mustafa thrives in its own expansive Mustafa Centre on Syed Alwi Road, just a stone’s throw away. The old Mustafa, though smaller, was always bustling with shoppers, especially Indian tourists eager to buy everything from Sony TVs to Lindt chocolates.\n\nDeparting passengers at Changi Airport often carried packages containing audio and video equipment, items reputedly cheaper in Singapore than in India. Some of them bought in bulk and were likely couriers for shops selling foreign goods in India. India had strict import restrictions back then, but markets like Kolkata’s Fancy Market specialised in foreign products.\n\nToday, Kolkata boasts upscale malls with luxury brands, and Indians no longer need to shop abroad for electronics or luxury goods.\n\nYet, around the world, tourism boards, hotels and restaurants are constantly competing for Indian travellers, especially in the Middle East and South-east Asia, says The Economist. Vietnam is a growing destination for Indian tourists, while Singapore, Thailand and Dubai remain popular.\n\nIndians mostly saw foreign lands in movies back then. Who remembers Shammi Kapoor and Sharmila Tagore in An Evening In Paris or Joy Mukherjee and Asha Parekh in Love In Tokyo? These old Bollywood blockbusters linger in the memories of senior citizens who recall a different India and a different Singapore, when accounts were kept in ledgers, typists typed on typewriters, stenographers took dictation in shorthand and nobody owned a cell phone.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a480ef35ed9e65388b6e90e46c2bee350021f5a9b6ff63d1efebe99f36a67768?w=825", "alt_text": "Specialists’ Shopping Centre in Orchard Road during the 1990s."}]}

However, it ended 8-1 after a cagey final quarter.\n\nThe defending champions rode on a superb attacking display led by Raj Kumar Pal who scored his maiden international hat-trick and 20-year-old Araijeet Singh Hundal who won the Player of the Match award for scoring two goals.\n\nIndia scored as many as five goals from open play with the remaining three coming from penalty corners.\n\nWhile penalty corner conversion was an issue on Wednesday – India had 15 – the team can take a lot of confidence from their young players stepping up and scoring field goals.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, where India won bronze, the team’s inability to score from open play was a cause for concern.\n\nIndia made 27 circle penetrations, 12 more than Malaysia and had 55 per cent possession, dominating the proceedings against the finalists from the last edition.\n\nIndia began their title defense in China with a 3-0 win over the hosts before hammering Japan 5-1 on Monday.\n\nFree Malaysia Today columnist Frankie D’Cruz termed Malaysia’s defeat: “Malaysian hockey’s embarrassment for eternity”.\n\n“Malaysia fell apart from the first minute to the last in a game that perfectly captured the sense of decayed national hockey architecture,” he wrote. “You could pick a slew of words to describe the 8-1 demolition of Malaysia at the hands of India, once a banana-skin opponent... None of them would be pretty.”\n\nThe News Straits Times said alarm bells are ringing for Malaysian hockey as coach Sarjit Singh’s rebuilding project seems to be falling apart.\n\n“Just two days after a shocking 4-2 defeat by minnows China, world No. 13 Malaysia were handed their worst-ever defeat by India,” it noted. “It’s their heaviest defeat in 36 encounters against the world No. 5, dating all the way back to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.”\n\nSarjit, who was appointed in March, admitted his team’s morale collapsed after conceding three goals in the opening seven minutes.\n\n“We gave India too much respect,” said the frustrated coach. “Our defensive structure failed, and though my players tried to fight back, India were just too good. It’s disappointing.”\n\nIndia hold a strong track record at the Asian Champions Trophy, having won the title four times – the most by any team.\n\nIts last triumph was achieved on home soil last year, where they defeated Malaysia 4-3 in the final.\n\nWhile 10 of India’s 16 Paris Olympics medallists are playing in China, vice-captain Hardik Singh, Mandeep Singh, Lalit Upadhyay, Shamsher Singh and Gurjant Singh have been rested.\n\nIn their place is a young forward line that includes Araijeet, Uttam Singh, Mohammed Raheel Mouseen and debutant Gurjot Singh.\n\nIndia were scheduled to play South Korea on Sept 12 and Pakistan on Sept 14.

As cries of Ganpati Bappa Morya (asking Lord Ganesha to remove obstacles in people’s path and bless them with success) rang in the air, he shook hands with many of those who turned up to meet him.”\n\nGanesh Chaturthi, which celebrates Lord Ganesha as the god of new beginnings, is being celebrated in Singapore and elsewhere in the world this weekend.

The force of the collision was such that the SUV caught fire and the four occupants were trapped inside which resulted in their deaths.\n\nThe bodies were charred beyond recognition.\n\nSeveral others sustained non-life-threatening injuries though the exact number remains unclear.\n\nThe victims were identified as Mr Aryan Raghunath Orampatti from Hyderabad, Mr Farooq Sheikh, Mr Lokesh Palacharla and Ms Darshini Vasudevan from Tamil Nadu.\n\nMr Orampatti and Mr Sheikh were returning after visiting a cousin in Dallas while Mr Palacharla was heading to Bentonville to reunite with his wife.\n\nMs Darshini, a postgraduate from the University of Texas, was on her way to visit her uncle in Arkansas.\n\nThe identification of the victims was delayed due to the long weekend and the need for DNA fingerprinting, using bone remnants to confirm their identities.\n\n“Darshini’s uncle Ramanujam lives in Bentonville, Arkansas,” Mr Manjunath said. “She was going to visit him.

Wow,” while sharing the video on his X handle.\n\nSheetal, the only woman without arms who competed in archery at the Paris Paralympics, delivered a record-breaking performance in the qualifiers, edging the previous world record of 698 with an impressive 703 out of 720 points.\n\nShe was, however, overtaken by Turkey’s Oznur Cure who scored 704 points.\n\nSheetal was knocked out in the last-16 by Chile’s Mariani Zuniga 137-138.

He called the roundtable formed between India and Singapore a “path-breaking” mechanism.\n\n“I thank you for your warm welcome. This is our first meeting after you assumed the post of prime minister. Many congratulations to you from my side. I am confident that under the leadership of 4G, Singapore will progress even faster,” Mr Modi said.\n\nThe Indian Prime Minister added: “We also want to create many Singapores in India, and I am happy that we are working together in this direction.”\n\nHe noted that cooperation between the two nations in various sectors, including digitalisation, advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity, has become an identity of the India-Singapore ministerial roundtable.\n\n“Singapore is also an important facilitator of our Act East policy,” said Mr Modi. “Our shared belief in democratic values connects us with each other. I am delighted to have the opportunity to visit Singapore at the beginning of my third term.\n\n“Our strategic partnership is completing a decade. Over the past ten years, our trade has more than doubled. Mutual investment has increased almost threefold to cross US$150 billion.”\n\nMr Modi said he is pleased that the India-Singapore relationship is being raised to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\n\n“The 3.5 lakh (350,000) people of Indian origin residing in Singapore are the strong foundation of our relationship,” he said. “We are forever thankful to Singapore for the place and honour that (Indian freedom fighter) Subhash Chandra Bose, Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army formed to liberate India from British rule) and Little India have received in Singapore.”\n\nIndia aims to grow its semiconductor industry and become a global node for semiconductor manufacturing, while players in Singapore’s ecosystem are looking to enter emerging markets.\n\nThe MOU in this area will see both countries partnering to support India’s growth plans and facilitate the entry of Singapore companies and supply chains in the Indian market. Mr Modi noted that rapid and sustained growth in India has opened up immense investment opportunities for Singaporean entities.\n\nHe and PM Wong also reviewed existing cooperation in the fields of defence and security, maritime domain awareness, education, AI, fintech, new technology domains and science and technology.\n\nAs part of the official visit, Mr Modi called on President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and met Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.

It is not contagious.\n\nThose afflicted, like Ms Malini, often experience self-esteem issues at the onset of the condition.\n\nMs Malini was eight years old when she first noticed that something was not right after a tree branch hit her eye. The accident left a white patch on her eyelid.\n\nHer parents, neither of whom has any family history of the condition, dismissed it as a healing wound.\n\nBut six years later, as 20 per cent of her body became covered in white patches, her parents took her to see a dermatologist.\n\n“I could still cover them up by wearing long sleeves or heavy make-up. But there was always one thing that was constantly ringing in my head when I looked in the mirror: Ugly, ugly, ugly,” said the 44-year-old, who teaches at Republic Polytechnic’s School of Applied Science.\n\nMs Malini resorted to using topical steroid cream to heal the pale patches, but more patches appeared. Frustrated, she decided at age 16 to forgo any sort of treatment altogether.\n\nDr Goh Boon Kee, a dermatologist at Skin Physicians in Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, who sees about 100 vitiligo patients a month, said that the common concern among patients is their appearance.\n\nVitiligo has no cure, said Dr Goh, adding that there are three approaches to treating the condition – by stopping it from spreading, repigmentation or camouflage.\n\nTo stop the spread of vitiligo, he said, oral steroids and steroid creams can be used, while phototherapy – exposure to light at controlled wavelengths – may help restore skin colour.\n\nResearchers estimate that vitiligo affects around 1 per cent of the world’s population. Notable vitiligo sufferers include American pop star Michael Jackson and Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan – yet, the condition is still not widely understood.\n\nMs Malini said people often think she had suffered serious burns, “or worse, that I have a contagious disease”, she said with a laugh.\n\nShe soon discovered that using Jackson as a reference when explaining her condition to others helped.\n\nThe King of Pop, an African American who died in 2009 at age 50, was diagnosed with vitiligo when he was 24, and faced countless accusations of bleaching his skin to appear white. By the time he was 31, most of his skin had lost its pigment.\n\nMs Malini slowly grew more confident in her own skin – patches and all – thanks to support from her teachers and being treated “normally” by her friends.\n\nBut there are still moments when she feels ostracised. She recalled occasions when curious children stared at her before they were pulled away by their parents.\n\n“I get that kids are kids, but I wish the adults would educate their child on why I look like that, instead of turning them away,” Ms Malini said.\n\nTalking openly about living with vitiligo – and enlightening others – have helped those afflicted with it cope better with their situation.\n\nWhen Ms Malini enrolled at the National Institute of Education at age 22 to be a teacher, she was told to expect that students would inevitably stare at her and some might say something offensive.\n\nSo, on her first day as a teacher, as she introduced herself to her students, who ranged from 13 to 17 years old, she explained vitiligo to them and encouraged them to ask questions.\n\nHer direct approach made her students feel comfortable and eager to learn about her condition, she said.\n\nMs Malini, who has two daughters, aged eight and 15, said before she got married in 2008, she feared that the genetic condition may be passed down to her children. But she overcame her concern with her husband’s support.\n\nNow, with her skin about 98 per cent white, Ms Malini calls herself the “unofficial one-man support group” for people with vitiligo – she has advised and counselled friends of friends who have the condition – and hopes to start a proper support group one day.\n\nBy Fatimah Mujibah for The Straits Times\n\n“There was always one thing that was constantly ringing in my head when I looked in the mirror: Ugly, ugly, ugly.”\n\nMs Malini Thyagesan on grappling with vitiligo during her younger days", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1c2875647a66ccd8ea1777728d1ac9b6b798dd2e8daa40babc542ff563e3f602?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Malini Thyagesan."}]}

By learning traditional elements, the next generation can ensure the continued vibrancy of our cultural heritage.”\n\nMr C. Neelamegan, assistant regional director of the Kanchipuram District Department of Art and Culture in Tamil Nadu, expressed his appreciation for Singapore’s support to preserve and promote these traditional art forms.\n\n“It is great to see the Singapore Indian communities and art groups coming together to support the initiatives and raise awareness of the art forms among youngsters,” he said.\n\nFolk singer Suganthi, who performed at the Esplanade, said it was always her dream to perform the songs her mother, a former agricultural worker, used to sing during the 60s and 70s.\n\n“The lyrics of songs from each region are a reflection of its unique culture,” she said.\n\n“These songs evoke raw emotions, and it’s essential to share them with everyone, so they can live on forever.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9cdc41a797e06fba1101ea9cf8ae33e4d3e68e6381290dc8eb00627d6c358402?w=825", "alt_text": "Dancers from India performing the thudumbattan, while playing the uruttu drum."}]}

He was seen as an astute leader who successfully made alliances with or militarily resisted the ruling powers of his time.\n\nIn recent years, he has become an increasingly central figure in Maharashtra’s politics and no political party can afford to ignore him or be accused of insulting him.\n\nMarathas from Shivaji’s caste dominate the political landscape of the state – 12 of 20 chief ministers since the state’s formation have been Marathas.\n\nSo the statue’s collapse, weeks before elections are due in Maharashtra, has put the state’s ruling coalition on the back foot and given opposition parties a potent issue to raise.\n\nIt even drew an apology from Mr Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is part of Maharashtra’s ruling coalition, reported The Times of India.\n\n“The moment I landed here, I first apologised to Shivaji over the statue collapse. I also apologise to the people who were hurt by the collapse,” PM Modi said in Maharashtra’s Palghar on Aug 30.\n\n“Those who consider Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as their deity and have been deeply hurt, I bow my head and apologise to them. Our values are different. For us, nothing is bigger than our deity.”\n\nThe public works department said that rusting nuts and bolts posed a risk to the statue’s stability, yet the warnings were ignored.\n\nThe Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance has accused the ruling government of corruption in the matter of the statue construction and demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.\n\nAmid the raging controversy, Mr Shinde said he was ready to put his head on the Maratha warrior’s feet and apologise 100 times.\n\nSenior opposition leader Sharad Pawar said during a protest rally that numerous statues of Shivaji across the state were still standing but only the newly installed one had collapsed.\n\n“There was corruption in the process of installing the statue. This is an insult to Chhatrapati Maharaj,” he alleged.\n\nMr Shinde has denied the charges, saying the statue collapsed because of strong winds in the coastal town.\n\nMr Ashish Shelar, the BJP’s Mumbai chief, has also apologised publicly, saying the mistake will be rectified and the culprits will face punishment.\n\nPolice have arrested one person, the structural consultant on the project, and say they are on the lookout for the statue’s sculptor.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/158fbed8fe2901b25ea4b2ab48911d3a8374cab1711502782e706136b5730536?w=825", "alt_text": "An iron statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Dec 4 last year, collapsed on Aug 26."}]}

The code names reflect those used during the actual event.”\n\nApart from the disclaimer, the series carries no other further edits, Ms Shergill said.\n\nShe added that the platform is fully dedicated to representing the authenticity in their stories: “India has a rich culture of storytelling, and we are committed to showcasing these stories and their authentic representation.”\n\nThe statement came hours after her meeting with officials from India’s Information and Broadcasting Ministry, during which she explained Netflix’s stance on the whole issue.\n\nA massive row had erupted over the Netflix mini-series, which tells the story of the hijack of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 by Pakistan-based terror outfit Harkat-ul-Mujahideen in 1999. Five hijackers took control of the plane and diverted it to Afghanistan, which was then ruled by the Taliban.\n\nThe Indian government, then led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, released three terrorists – Masood Azhar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Mushtaq Zargar – to secure the release of 154 hostages.\n\nAfter the series was released, hundreds of social media users accused the creators – Anubhav Sinha and Trishant Srivastava – of changing the names of two hijackers to Bhola and Shankar.\n\nThis has been claimed as a distortion of historical facts and critics have declared it misrepresents the terrorists’ real identities. They have also claimed it offends Hindu sentiments.\n\nA section of the audience accused the makers of allegedly “whitewashing terrorism” by not mentioning the real names of the terrorists. The terrorists in the show are addressed as Chief, Doctor, Shankar, Bhola and Burger, which were their codenames for the hijack operation.\n\nAccording to Indian government records, their real names were Ibrahim Athar, Shahid Akhtar Sayeed, Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Zahoor Mistry and Shakir.\n\nSeveral people on social media started trending the hashtag #BoycottNetflix, alleging that IC 814 attempts to disparage the Hindu community by representing the terrorists as Hindus.\n\nThe protests led to Ms Shergill being summoned by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry.

Kavi\n\nகி. ஜனார்த்தனன்\n\nWith some 30-odd people hoisting “Welcome Home” banners at an arrival hall in Changi Airport, many might have assumed it was a victorious athlete returning home late from the Paris Olympics on Tuesday.\n\nBut it wasn’t kitesurfer Max Maeder or track star Shanti Pereira the crowd were waiting and cheering for – it was little-known 18-year-old Laavinia Jaiganth.\n\nThe track prodigy had just accomplished something no Singaporean under the age of 20 has in 50 years – she clocked 54.66sec in the women’s 400m at the World Athletics Under-20 Championships in Lima, Peru.\n\nThough her time on Aug 28 was not enough for her progress to the semi-finals, it was enough to eclipse Chee Swee Lee’s old mark of 55.08sec set at the 1974 Asian Games in Tehran, Iran, where Chee bagged the gold medal.\n\n“My efforts in training paid off. I am happy to be able to attain this extraordinary achievement. The support of my coach, family and loved ones brought me this far,” Laavinia told tabla!\n\nBefore the race, Laavinia, a second-year student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s business school, trained intensely for two-and-a-half weeks, running at a high-altitude training ground in Quito, Ecuador.\n\n“Training at high-altitude really helped when we went to sea level in Peru, because the oxygen levels changed,” she said.\n\n“It was a very committed two weeks to hit my personal best. For most of the days I was training twice a day.”\n\nShe had qualified for the meet via a universality slot as the best-performing female U-20 athlete. Her previous best was 56.86sec at the Singapore Open in April.\n\nThis is the second record-breaking achievement for Singaporean runners this season, after sprint queen Shanti Pereira bettered the national 400m mark with her 53.67sec effort at the Florida Relays on March 30.\n\nDipna Lim-Prasad’s previous mark of 54.18sec was set at the 2017 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nLaavinia’s coach Fabian William, who accompanied her back home, described her experience as one which he had learnt much from.\n\n“It has been quite an interesting journey, because as a coach, I think I have learnt from watching her, how she responds to emotions and functions under pressure,” he said.\n\n“So now is the challenging part where we have to sit down and decide, okay, what’s the next step?”\n\nFather Jaiganth Arumugam, 51, expressed happiness that his youngest daughter’s hard work paid off.\n\nHe explained Laavinia had decided to become an athlete while in primary school, and since then he and his wife Letchumi have supported her “through encouragement, motivation and definitely, once in a while, discipline”.\n\n“I’m definitely very proud of her. She has surpassed our expectations, and I think her own.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/842b3dff34e1d75726acb2a8905ba1f9256f1ea8f00c94f12b19e02ed944885a?w=825", "alt_text": "Athlete Laavinia Jaiganth with flowers from fans at Changi Airport on Tuesday."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA.R. Rahman made history on Aug 31 by becoming the first Indian musician to perform live at the National Stadium.\n\nBut the 57-year-old double Oscar winner’s 180-minute effort left a vast majority of the 25,000 spectators fuming in disappointment.\n\nThere was a litany of gripes. From the breeze-less venue on a hot evening to the legendary singer-composer appearing tiny on a stage set in a far corner, what also irked many in the crowd was that there were far too few Tamil songs in Rahman’s repertoire; not to mention the poor acoustics.\n\nAll eyes were on Rahman as he was performing in Singapore after a decade. His last performance at Gardens by the Bay was marred by technical issues and a blackout. It was also held outdoors and not at a proper concert venue.\n\nOrganiser Maestro Productions Global had promised that the event at the National Stadium would be glitch-free. It co-produced the event with UnUsUal Entertaintainment, a local company experienced in organising big music shows here and overseas.\n\nSince the artiste appeared like a speck to all those who bought lower-category tickets, many in the audience had to turn to the LED screens to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nIndeed, problems surfaced even before the event commenced as the crowd entered the National Stadium.\n\nWith temperatures at 30 deg C coupled with high humidity levels, the affair felt unbearably hot as only a part of the stadium’s rafters was open for air.\n\nThe facility did not have the luxury of air-conditioning, unlike at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, where Maestro held successful concerts featuring Anirudh Ravichander and Yuvan Shankar Raja.\n\n“I bought a Premium Category 1 ticket but got squeezed into a cramped, poorly ventilated section with chairs literally tied together,” complained Vidhu Vijay on Facebook. “Everything appeared so stiff.”\n\nThe organiser perhaps did not want spectators to drag chairs away and move closer to the stage. But the move drew many unhappy patrons.\n\nBefore Rahman’s gig started, local radio deejay Joakim Gomez and actor Jay Nesh had got the audience, which included former Singapore president Halimah Yacob and her husband in the front row, excited by making them do a few moves, such as the Kallang roar and waving their handphone flashlights.\n\nLocal musician Shabir Sulthan too did a solo number that was catchy.\n\nAfter a 15-minute break, Rahman appeared on stage. He was welcomed by thunderous applause, whistles and cheers.\n\nBut he made little attempt to connect with the crowd, opening quickly with Jai Ho, the theme song from the Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire (2008) that catapulted him to overnight fame in the West.\n\n“Rahman is known to be soft-spoken but he should have done a better job of introducing his team and detailing what he was going to do,” said Avneet Prakash, a software engineer who was among the crowd.\n\n“He lost most of the audience there itself as he continued to be indifferent to their needs and seemed focused on completing the song list.\n\n“He described his son A.R. Ameen as a ‘shy boy raised in Chennai’, but no one could really make out who the other singers were. Some of them he was clearly promoting. But the crowd could not relate to them as their names were not highlighted.”\n\nThe 31-member team of singers, dancers and band musicians that Rahman brought along included Indian playback singers Mohit Chauhan and Rakshita Suresh as well as noted performers Srinivas and Mano.\n\nBut lost in the stream of back-up singers who made it to the stage were vocalist-composer Shakthisree Gopalan, Hriday and Shuba.\n\nFans got excited and sang along when Rahman and his team collaborated on the ’90s hit songs Mukkala Mukkabala and Veerapandi Kotayyile (1993), but they became visibly subdued when the musicians tried out renditions of Nadaan Parinde (2011) and Minsara Poove (1999).\n\n“The band was ordinary, they did not do anything special,” said Geetha Venkat, a home maker.\n\n“The organisers said it would be an evening of Rahman rhapsody and full of his greatest hits. But there were only a few of his hit numbers from the 1990s and early 2000s which made him famous.\n\n“It is natural that he would want to play some of his latest numbers, But he overdid it, putting everyone to sleep during the middle part of the show.”\n\nAmong the crowd was a big group of North Indians, Malays and Indonesians – all fans of Bollywood film and music. To appease them, Rahman sang several Hindi songs, including his Bollywood hits such as Kun Faya Kun (2011), Tere Bina (2006) and Agar Tum Saath Ho (2015).\n\n“But that again became counter-productive as the majority of the spectators, local Tamils, became offended,” said Ms Geetha. “They expected more Tamil songs and fell silent when the Bollywood songs were performed.”\n\nThe crowd got going again when Rahman sang 1998’s Jumbalaka with home-grown veteran Mohamed Raffee. But they could not find their groove when rappers like India’s Blaaze, Malaysia’s Sri Rascol and Sri Lanka’s ADK took the stage with Indian-American singer-musician Shuba to perform a medley of nostalgic Indian songs such as Taxi, Taxi (2008), Ponmagal Vandaal (2007) and Magudi Magudi (2012).\n\nThese were tunes that dominated the Indian charts in the early 2000s. But the audience clearly wanted to hear Rahman hits such as Vande Matram, Chaiya Chaiya and Mustafa.\n\nRahman abruptly ended the show with his popular number Urvasi Urvasi, but by then the audience were largely left unsatisfied, even though 35 songs were performed in total.\n\nAs many began to blast Maestro on Facebook and Instagram for the “disappointing show”, the company, in its defence, said it tried its best and could not tell Rahman which songs to sing.\n\nIndeed, Rahman is a megastar. He has a global fan base that transcends language and ethnicity. His music is universal. But, as fan Stephen Philip put it, “the show was not worth the money”.\n\n“However great a musician may be, he should have a rapport with the audience. Rahman had zero connect. His ignorance and ego shone throughout.”\n\nEx-President Halimah Yacob and her husband Mohammed Abdullah Alhabshee were among the audience of 25,000 at the National Stadium on Aug 31.\n\nPhotos: The Straits Times\n\n“However great a musician may be, he should have a rapport with the audience.

The streets buzzed with colour and noise – the scent of fresh flowers mingling with street food, and shoppers banging into each other at every corner. Amid this vibrant scene, two women found themselves in a small, unassuming sari shop.\n\nInside, the shop walls were lined with saris of every colour. But it was the one on the mannequin in the centre of the shop that caught the eyes of both Jigna Patel and Priya Ramesh.\n\nRound 1: The sizing-up\n\nJigna, a Gujarati visiting from Ahmedabad, eyed the emerald green sari with intricate gold zari work. It was the kind of sari that would turn heads and just like one she had seen Deepika Padukone donning.\n\nPriya, a Tamil Singaporean, had also locked onto the same sari. She imagined herself draped in its luxurious fabric at her cousin’s wedding next month. But, she noticed the gleam in Jigna’s eyes and knew this wasn’t going to be an easy purchase.\n\nThe two exchanged polite smiles.\n\n“Such a beautiful piece, isn’t it?” Priya remarked, testing the waters.\n\n“Yes, quite stunning,” Jigna replied, her tone pleasant but determined. “You have good taste.”\n\n“You too,” Priya responded with a tight-lipped smile.\n\nThe shopkeeper, sensing trouble, hurried over. “Ah, madams, you both have excellent taste! This sari is indeed special – only one piece left in stock. Perfect for a wedding or special occasion.”\n\nThe mention of it being the last piece made both women’s eyes narrow ever so slightly. This was no longer just about buying a sari; it was about not letting the other win.\n\nRound 2: The opening bid\n\nJigna, with the assertiveness of a seasoned Gujarati bargainer, made her move. “How much for this sari, bhaiya?”\n\nThe shopkeeper smiled. “For this masterpiece, madam, $600.”\n\nPriya almost choked but quickly recovered. “$600? For this? Come on, uncle, you can do better.”\n\nJigna, unfazed, gave the shopkeeper a knowing look. “$600 is way too much. I’ll give you $300.”\n\nPriya jumped in. “$300? I’ll give you $325,” she said, not about to lose.\n\nJigna turned to Priya, her eyebrows raised. “$325? I’m willing to go up to $350, but that’s it.”\n\nPriya shot back, “$375, final offer.”\n\nThe shopkeeper, following the back-and-forth like a tennis match, decided to interject. “Madams, let’s settle on $450, and it’s yours.”\n\nRound 3: The tug-of-war\n\nBoth women shook their heads simultaneously. Neither wanted to let go. The shopkeeper’s suggestion of $450 was met with silence as they considered their next move.\n\nJigna leaned in, lowering her voice as if to share a secret. “Bhaiya, I’m Gujarati, you know, like the Ambanis. Just like Nita Bhabhi, we know our saris, and I can tell you right now, this one is worth $400 at most. I’ll give you $400 and not a cent more.”\n\nPriya, not to be outdone, leaned in from the other side. “Uncle, I’ve been shopping here for years. You can’t let a loyal customer walk away empty-handed. $425, and I’ll make sure to tell all my friends to come here.”\n\nThe situation was at an impasse.\n\nSuddenly, Priya had an idea. She turned to Jigna and in a hushed tone said: “How about this? You and I both love this sari, but neither of us wants to pay more. So, why don’t we split the cost? We’ll each pay $206, and share the sari.”\n\nJigna looked at Priya, surprised. It was unconventional, but it made sense. Plus, it meant neither of them had to concede entirely.\n\nThe shopkeeper who was only interested in getting his money regardless of who paid, brightened at this proposal. “That’s a fair solution. $412, split between the two of you!”\n\nPriya grinned. “And we can take turns wearing it. I’ll wear it to my cousin’s wedding next month, and then Jigna can have it for her son’s wedding. It’s too beautiful to wear just once! And my guests will be totally different from yours!”\n\nJigna pursed her lips. She had never done this before. She thought to herself: “Anyway I can’t wear this sari more than once, not after my pictures are shown on Insta and FB. And for the savings of $206, I can pick up matching jewellery too.”\n\n“Deal! And I’ll cover the cost of dry-cleaning after each wear,” Jigna replied out loud.\n\nBoth women laughed, pleased with their clever solution. The shopkeeper, relieved to have made the sale, quickly wrapped up the sari and handed it to them.\n\nAftermath: The bond of sharing\n\nAs they left the shop, each with half the victory and a new friend, they walked side by side, laughing and chatting.\n\n“You know,” Priya said, glancing at Jigna, “haggling isn’t just about saving money. It’s about finding creative solutions – and sometimes, making a new friend.”\n\nJigna nodded. “Exactly. And the best part? We both feel like we’ve won. That’s the true art of haggling.”\n\nHaggling, as Jigna and Priya’s story shows, is more than just a way to save money. It’s a social ritual, a cultural practice honed over centuries. In markets across India and in Indian communities around the world, haggling is a way to connect with others, assert one’s knowledge and find satisfaction in the process. It’s about relationships, stories, and memories.\n\nWhether you’re kanjoos (stingy) or savvy, haggling is a part of who you are, and a tradition that adds excitement to shopping and leaves everyone with a story to tell.\n\nSo the next time you’re in Little India or any other market, don’t be afraid to haggle. Embrace it, enjoy it and remember: It’s not just about the price – it’s about the experience, the connection and the joy of the game.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a7bc0587d42b0b8e23cd77d898b1ab26106db21a82d98ebedc1258b0b4691db1?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nDeepavali showcases both the festival of lights and the enduring grace of the saree – a garment loved by Indian communities across the globe, including in Singapore.\n\nIt brings together people of all backgrounds, especially women who love to wear the saree, which has become a symbol of cultural pride.\n\nIndia has a diverse range of regional weaves, some of which are featured here by nine women from different professions and states. All live in Singapore and love the traditional nine-yard.\n\nSome have personal connections to the state their saree hails from, while others have a lovely story attached to it. Others wear the weave simply because they admire the artistry.\n\nWhether it’s the bold Patola, the ethereal Chanderi or the earthy Kasavu, the varieties are remarkable.\n\n“The Paithani I am wearing comes from Maharashtra, and holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first purchase of my wedding trousseau,” said Ms Deepali Satpute, a marketing lead who came up with the concept and styling for the photoshoot.\n\n“The Paithani is known for its intricate designs, often featuring peacocks and floral motifs woven into vibrant silk. Historically, it was a symbol of royalty, crafted with gold and silver threads, and remains a timeless example of textile brilliance.”\n\nEach Indian saree is far more than a beautiful piece of fabric; it reflects the craftsmanship unique to its origin, from the lustrous silks of the South to the meticulously crafted handlooms of the East.\n\nEach one also embodies the dedication of artisans who create such masterpieces day after day, keeping alive a craft passed down generations.\n\n“Wearing a Kerala kasavu saree for Deepavali in Singapore can have several layers of significance, both cultural and personal,” said make-up artiste Gayathri Menon. “It can be a way to celebrate one’s roots and showcase the beauty of South Indian traditions in a multicultural setting.\n\n“The Kerala outfit is all about understated grace. It is also light and airy, aligning with Singapore’s tropical climate.”\n\nThe saree is one of the oldest garments in the world, with its origins tracing back over 5,000 years. This iconic piece of clothing has survived the ages and continues to adapt to modern styles while retaining its cultural significance.\n\n“Phulkari is a vibrant and rich textile tradition from Punjab, embodying both artistry and cultural heritage,” said Ms Sandeepa Arora Nair, who runs an Indian wear boutique. “Its intricate floral patterns, typically embroidered on fabrics such as dupatta, saree and lehenga, reflect the region’s love for colour and design.\n\n“Each piece tells a story, showcasing traditional motifs and craftsmanship. Phulkari is not just about fashion; it’s a celebration of life and festivals, like Deepavali.”\n\nDeepavali is the perfect time to showcase India’s extraordinary saree heritage, said Ms Geeta Balagangadharan, a business strategy and talent development consultant who has been wearing sarees since her teens and has a huge collection.\n\n“Over the years, I have learnt a lot about the intricate weaves, their rich histories and unique characteristics,” she said.\n\n“I’ve officially turned the map of India into my personal shopping guide – to help create a ‘must-have’ on my saree wish list. For someone who rarely wore Indian attire, let alone a saree, I must admit, I never miss an opportunity to drape one now.\n\n“What was once a school uniform has now become a personal expression of heritage, identity and an everlasting respect for the hands and hearts that create them.”\n\n(Standing, from left): Regina Sheth – Chanderi (Madhya Pradesh) Vyshnavi Krishna – Pochampalli Ikkat (Telangana), Meena Bennett – Mekhela Chador (Assam), Kirti Malaviya – Patola (Saurashtra), Sandeepa Arora Nair – Phulkari (Punjab); (sitting, from left) Gayathri Menon – Kasavu (Kerala), Anu Alex – Kancheepuram Pattu (Tamil Nadu), Deepali Satpute – Paithani (Maharashtra), and Chandni Sahu – Bandhini (Gujarat)\n\nPhoto: Vhok Jhon and Dvita M", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6b297814f5b35f9f717b361a1d95d339279a2efefedb99ab0950c78e69f4104b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

It is the second-most popular traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi.\n\nKho kho is played on a rectangular court with a central lane connecting two poles which are at either end. During the game, nine players from the chasing team are on the field, with eight of them sitting (crouched) in the central lane, while three runners from the defending team run around the court and try to avoid being touched.\n\nEach team has two turns to score and two turns to defend, with each turn lasting nine minutes. The team that scores the most points by the end of the game wins.\n\nThe sport is widely played across South Asia, and also has a presence in other regions with a significant South Asian diaspora, such as South Africa and England.\n\nIt is played primarily by school children, but is also a competitive sport. The first franchise league for the sport, Ultimate Kho Kho, was unveiled in India in August 2022.\n\nTeams from around the world will bring diverse talents to the World Cup. The African continent will be represented by Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda, while Asia boasts a strong line-up including India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, South Korea and Sri Lanka.\n\nEuropean teams from England, Germany, Netherlands and Poland will participate, along with North America’s Canada and the United States, South America’s Brazil and Peru, and Oceania’s Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThis wide array of participating countries underscores the growing appeal of kho kho at international level. The championship’s format includes separate divisions for men and women, with 16 teams in each.\n\n“This historic championship represents a massive leap for kho kho, transforming it from a beloved local sport to a global phenomenon,” said KKFI president Sudhanshu Mittal. “With India leading this sporting revolution, the 2025 World Cup promises to be the big step that will take kho kho to the next stage in the global sports ecosystem.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/be4bce85058ba6f023a853acd4c86e4633828352534393a7bcb4341ca51d983e?w=825", "alt_text": "A match between Maharashtra and the Rest of India at the World Cup announcement ceremony."}]}

Though he attempted to remain incognito with a hat, shades and a face mask, passers-by recognised him while airport officials conducted security checks on his documents.\n\nIn a video that has since gone viral on social media, Ranveer is seen patiently waiting at the airport entrance as officers verify his papers, reported The Indian Express.\n\nNotably, Singham Again marks Ranveer and Deepika’s first film since welcoming their baby girl on Sept 8. Though the couple, who tied the knot in 2018, shared the news on Instagram, they have yet to reveal their child’s name.\n\nWhile Ranveer’s last appearance was in Karan Johar’s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (2023), Deepika’s most recent film was Nag Ashwin’s Kalki 2898 AD (2024).\n\nThe fifth instalment in the Cop Universe and a direct sequel to Singham Returns (2014), Rohit’s Singham Again also stars Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor and Jackie Shroff.\n\nBollywood superstar Salman Khan will make a cameo appearance as Chulbul Pandey, his iconic character from the Dabangg series.\n\nInterestingly, Singham Again will face a big battle on Deepavali, as it comes up against the Kartik Aaryan led Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, which releases on the same day.\n\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 too boasts a big ensemble including stars like Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit.\n\nAs both movies get ready for release, the Central Board of Film Certification has finally cleared Singham Again with a U/A certificate, but with several cuts.\n\nThe makers have been asked to alter the 23-second visual depictions of Lord Rama, Sita Mata and Lord Hanuman with that of Singham, Avni and Simmba.\n\nA 26-second dialogue and visuals too had to be modifed, as it affects “international diplomatic relations of India with a neighbouring state”.\n\nThe following disclaimer was also added: “This film is purely a work of fiction. Although the film is inspired by the story of Lord Ram, neither its narrative nor the characters should be viewed as revered deities. The story features contemporary characters of today or societies, and their cultures, customs, practices and traditions.”\n\nThe two films are currently locked in a huge tussle over screen sharing. The Kartik starrer is being distributed by Anil Thadani, who probably is the biggest distributor in India, while the makers of the Singham film have joined hands with PVR-Inox, which has the most number of multiplex screens in north India.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a8283b61dbc4f627fdd64e17a7a6d3371acf86740388b57cced5144dba301be4?w=825", "alt_text": "Ranveer Singh in Singham Again."}]}

What’s next? Will I land a job? Am I headed in the right direction?\n\nBut what if you could take charge of your own future?\n\nRepublic Polytechnic (RP) is looking to make that transition smoother with its new “Designing Your Life” (DYL) programme, set to kick off next year.\n\nUnder the programme, incoming RP students will be guided by their lecturers who will use a design thinking approach developed by Stanford University in the United States to explore and plan their personal and career goals.\n\nThe programme will take students through the process of figuring out their life goals and job preferences by approaching the challenge the way a product designer would. They will be taught to approach problems with curiosity, reframe dysfunctional beliefs and prototype ideas to figure out what would be the right fit for them.\n\nOnce they have identified some fields that interest them, students will then be guided to tailor their three-year diploma course to explore their interests and hone their natural talents.\n\nDr Girija Veerappan, director, centre for educational development at RP, said the initiative is to empower students to define what success means to them.\n\n“Success wears many hats. For some, it’s about having a rewarding job, while for others it’s about making an impact through community service or pursuing higher education,” she said. “No matter where they start, every RP student will graduate as a better version of themselves.”\n\nDr Girija added that the programme includes refresher workshops conducted six months after a student has graduated – to check on students’ career paths and job satisfaction.\n\n“We want to make sure they’re on the right path and provide support if they need it,” she explained.\n\nManisha Saravanan, 17, a student in the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (students’ first year in poly)  echoes this sentiment.\n\n“With everything changing so fast, especially with AI, even though a lot of us have a clear idea of our future paths, there’s still a lot of uncertainty about how advanced AI will become.\n\n“Plus, there’s peer pressure. Many Indian parents, mine included, often ask me, ‘What’s your plan for the future? Are you ready for it?’ They always push me to choose something that’s successful, which adds to the pressure.”\n\nManisha, who will begin her diploma in human resource with psychology next April, said: “I think DYL is a great concept. It includes a mentorship programme where, after three years of my diploma, I can have a mentor for two years to ask questions.\n\n“After I graduate, if I’m unsure whether to jump into a job or pursue a degree in HR or psychology, I can reach out to them for guidance.”\n\nBy April 2025, around 800 RP lecturers will be trained to become mentors, and they’ll stick with the students for two years after graduation, helping them navigate the early stages of their careers.\n\nVarshini Anbalagan, 17, who’s gearing up to start her Diploma in Aviation Management next April, said the mentorship is beneficial “because not everyone lands a job right after graduation”.\n\n“Having a mentor gives them a chance to talk about their options and discover new job opportunities. Mentors can really help them figure out their next steps after graduation.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ea7b1e0c37769b2d44c7c6dc861120787bb008d81a8d9f8f7e3667ab40ec5ab2?w=825", "alt_text": "Republic Polytechnic student Manisha Saravanan."}]}

The will also provides for Mr Tata’s butler Subbiah, who served him for three decades. Mr Tata was known to buy designer clothes for them during his travels.\n\nThe will includes a legacy plan for Mr Tata’s shares in group companies, which are to be transferred to the Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation (RTEF), a charitable trust in line with the Tata Group’s tradition. Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran is expected to head the RTEF.\n\nMr Tata’s interests in other Tata Group companies, such as Tata Motors, will transfer to RTEF. This foundation, founded in 2022, has supported non-profit ventures and made notable investments, including a purchase of Tata Technologies shares before its 2023 IPO and a stake in Tata Digital, which runs the super-app Tata Neu.\n\nHis start-up investments through RNT Associates and RNT Advisers will be sold, and the proceeds directed to RTEF.\n\nMr Tata’s assistant Shantanu Naidu also features in the will, as Mr Tata relinquished his stake in Mr Naidu’s companionship company, Goodfellows, and waived a loan for Mr Naidu’s overseas studies.\n\nThe Halekai house in Mumbai’s Colaba, where Mr Tata resided, is owned by Ewart Investments, a Tata Sons subsidiary, and its future is pending a decision by Ewart. Mr Tata also designed the Halekai residence and a bungalow in Alibaug, the future of which remains undecided.\n\nMr Tata’s collection of about 30 luxury cars, housed at his Colaba residence and Taj Wellington Mews apartments, may either be acquired by the Tata Group for its museum in Pune or auctioned.\n\nHis numerous awards will be donated to the Tata Central Archives to preserve his legacy.\n\nDespite leading the US$100 billion Tata Group, Mr Tata never appeared on rich lists due to his limited personal stake in group companies. His will, expected to go through probate in the Bombay High Court, is likely to take several months to finalise.\n\nMr Tata, born on December 28, 1937, died at Mumbai’s Breach Candy Hospital, leaving behind an enduring legacy of leadership, ethical business practices and philanthropy.\n\nServing as Tata Group’s chairman from 1991 to 2012, and briefly as interim chairman in 2016, he was instrumental in the company’s growth from US$5.7 billion in 1991 to close to US$100 billion by 2012.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cfa0805cc7a82bd3724942de89d8c6add62d10bb57014645741168a45c8431f9?w=825", "alt_text": "Ratan Tata with his pet dog Tito."}]}

In fact, their predictive accuracy could put the world’s finest fortune tellers out of business.\n\nFrom what food you should eat to whom you should marry (arranged marriages, after all, are enjoying a comeback in Singapore), their advice is a finely tuned blend of wisdom and cosmic intuition.\n\nTake my friend Meera, for example. A successful professional in her early 30s, she had confidently declared she was “never going to go for an arranged marriage”. But, after years of romantic misfires, she started to feel the tug of parental influence.\n\nHer mother’s parting shot on the matter – “Wait till you’re 30, you’ll see things differently!” – came back like a boomerang, hitting her right on the nose. Now, she’s all set to meet “a nice boy from a good family”, and her mother’s smug smile practically glows through their WhatsApp calls.\n\nThe ‘you’ll see when you’re older’ mantra\n\nDesi parents operate on the “you’ll see when you’re older” principle, a gem of wisdom that applies to everything.\n\nNow, let’s not kid ourselves. Arranged marriages today aren’t the set-ups of yore. No one is trotting out biodata and horoscopes on the first date (well, not openly, anyway). But the idea that your parents might actually know a thing or two about compatibility is gaining ground.\n\nAnd desi parents are relishing this as the ultimate “I told you so” moment.\n\n‘Eat this, it’s good for your health” (or is it?)\n\nA major part of the desi parents’ superpower involves their intimate knowledge of food and its supposed benefits. It’s like having a personal nutritionist who’s always available – and doesn’t charge.\n\n“Eat more ghee, it’s good for the bones,” they say, spooning dollops of clarified butter onto your rice. Question it, and they’ll tell you: “Your dadi (grandmother) lived to 96 on this diet.” Meanwhile, you’re just hoping your cholesterol will, mercifully, behave.\n\nBut all this wisdom is moot when it comes to feeding prospective grooms or brides. It’s as if a successful match is made only if the prospect can survive fatal doses of mithai (sweets) and masala chai!\n\nThe magical art of knowing your fate (without asking)\n\nDesi parents have a mystical foresight about our lives that even the stars can’t match. Who needs a crystal ball when you have a parent who knew you’d become an engineer (despite your childhood aspirations of being a trapeze artiste)?\n\nThe irony is that, even if you do somehow end up as a trapeze artiste, they’ll claim they knew that all along too. And, when it comes to marriage, they have an uncanny ability to scope out compatibility.\n\nThey’ve had a mental list of “nice boys” and “good girls” on standby since our kindergarten days. Your father might “accidentally” mention that “Mrs Singh’s son has a stable job and cooks”. The matchmaking hints are subtle as a storm, but undeniable.\n\nWhy they’re never wrong – ever\n\nDesi parents operate on a level of certainty that most of us can only aspire to. Once they’ve set their minds on something – like an arranged marriage being the key to a stable life – there’s no wavering.\n\nYou could present them with statistics, the results of scientific studies, and even the wisdom of Google. But nothing shakes their confidence. “Statistics can be wrong,” they say. “I know because I have lived it.”\n\nThe modern twist: Self-arranged marriages\n\nBut now, in a modern-day plot twist that no desi parent could’ve seen coming, today’s young singles are taking the concept of arranged marriage into their own hands – literally.\n\nInstead of meeting potential partners at family gatherings, they’re now browsing “profiles” on apps like Tinder or Coffee Meets Bagel. It’s a fascinating hybrid where they arrange the match themselves, then fall in love – essentially self-arranged love matches, all carefully vetted by one’s own judgment (and a few strategic selfies).\n\nTo our parents, this might seem like outsourcing the family’s job to a dating app, but it is the latest evolution. “Arranged marriages are on trend, Amma!” my friend Priya says, swiping left and right on her phone. “I’m just handling the introductions myself.”\n\nIn her view, these “self-arranged” apps are the modern matchmaker, complete with a few filters to screen out non-viable prospects.\n\nImagine the irony: Our parents spent years vetting families and horoscopes, only for us to decide that apps and algorithms work just as well – no family gathering required.\n\nYet, when these self-arranged matches work out, desi parents don’t mind. They beam proudly, declaring: “See, we told you this is the modern way. Arranged marriage and love marriage both!\n\nIn the end, it’s a new era of arranged marriage, one where the kids pick the candidates, but parents can still bask in the satisfaction that they were right all along: Love is nice, but a well-arranged match is timeless.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/71fce8533c1fd5857295b97a2d3cbd8f56775ab767aad68d7f644a1e5f564272?w=825", "alt_text": "A scene from the movie What’s Love Got To Do With It, which stars Lily James and Shazad Latif, and centres on arranged marriages."}]}

Her marriage has helped her embrace her Indian heritage (her paternal grandparents were of mixed European and Asian lineage), and she has come to enjoy being a part of her husband’s cultural and religious traditions.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nWhen my husband first told his mother about me, she had two questions – “Is she Indian?” and “What’s her date and time of birth?”\n\nAfter my in-laws’ initial surprise that their son had chosen to bring home a Eurasian girl, they consulted a Hindu astrologer, who proclaimed that there was “no better lid for the jar”.\n\nApparently, we were perfect for each other, astrologically speaking.\n\nI met my in-laws for the first time at Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown – the biggest and oldest Hindu temple in Singapore – because they wanted our first meeting to be in an auspicious place.\n\nI had to shop for the occasion, as I did not have any attire appropriate for the temple, which frowns on shorts, skirts above the knee, sleeveless tops or revealing, overly tight clothing.\n\nWhen I found myself alone with my mother-in-law at a coffee shop later that day – my husband and father-in-law had gone to buy food and drinks – I decided to take the bull by its horns.\n\n“Aunty, you know I’m very open to learning about Indian culture and Hinduism, right?” I told her, wanting to acknowledge her reservations about having a non-Indian daughter-in-law.\n\nUnused to such a direct approach, she merely smiled and nodded.\n\nSoon after our first meeting, I was invited for dinner at my in-laws’ home in Boon Keng.\n\nI arrived with a bouquet for my mother-in-law, and she – to my surprise – presented me with a pair of diamond earrings and my first saree.\n\nWhen my husband and I decided to get married in 2018, just four months after we began dating, I learnt that Hindu temples are open for weddings only on certain auspicious dates.\n\nWe settled on a Sunday morning in late November, leaving us (or rather, my in-laws) six months to plan the wedding.\n\nAn Indian bride\n\nThus began my “Indian bride” education. Almost every weekend, we would go to the temple before having lunch – I tried to learn to eat with my hands – and visit jewellery and saree shops.\n\nIn the evenings, we would watch videos of Indian weddings on YouTube, my sister-in-law pausing the videos often to explain the rituals – and their significance – to me, so I would know what to expect on the big day.\n\nThe first time I wore a saree, I was terrified it might unravel, leaving me standing in the middle of a holy place in my underwear.\n\nAs my mother-in-law dressed me, wrapping the length of fabric around my body and pulling it tight, I vowed not to use the bathroom until we returned home.\n\nAt the temple, I could not walk up a flight of stairs without tripping over the hem of my saree. I spent the evening trying to stand still.\n\nSoon, our wedding day arrived.\n\nOne of the first Indian weddings I attended was my own, a traditional Hindu ceremony at Sri Muneeswaran Temple in Queenstown.\n\nMy husband and I left most of the wedding preparations to his parents; I was unfamiliar with the elements involved, and he was unable to rein in his parents’ excitement.\n\nBesides choosing the two Kanchipuram silk sarees I would wear for the ceremony, I, ever the journalist, wrote the English text for our invitation cards.\n\nMy main job was to show up and listen to the Iyer (Hindu priest) who would lead me through the rituals, which are performed in front of a ceremonial fire.\n\nMy in-laws pulled off a three-day wedding bash with about 500 guests, a “small” wedding by their standards. (My sister-in-law had 1,000 guests.) We even had an ice cream cart and a prata man, a hit with our guests.\n\nMy mother, stepfather, brother and brother-in-law flew in from Sydney, where they live, and took part in the ceremony.\n\nTraditionally, the best man is the bride’s brother, and I will always cherish the memory of my brother gamely taking on this role, participating in the rites and taking them seriously.\n\nPeople likely saw a big, happy family that day.\n\nBut before my husband and I decided to tie the knot – quite literally, as the groom knots a sacred thread, called the thali, around the bride’s neck – we had plenty of hard conversations.\n\nThese conversations, some ending in laughter and others in tears, forced us to be honest – with ourselves and with each other – about the compromises we were willing to make as an inter-ethnic couple still learning about each other’s history.\n\nHow did I feel about getting married in a Hindu temple? What would that ceremony look like, anyway?\n\nWould we also throw a separate “Western” dinner party? (We did, complete with a dance floor, sugee cake – a must for the Eurasians – and speeches by our family and friends.)\n\nWhat would married life look like? Did I mind building a Hindu altar in our matrimonial home?\n\nWould I accompany my husband to the temple? Observe major Hindu festivals such as Pongal, Thaipusam, Tamil New Year and Deepavali?\n\nWould he celebrate Christmas? What about Easter?\n\nShould I stop eating beef?\n\nMost importantly: how would we raise our children?\n\nChanging face of Singapore\n\nMy husband and I are part of a growing demographic in Singapore. In 2023, 18.1 per cent of all marriages here were inter-ethnic unions, up from 17.8 per cent in 2013 and 11.5 per cent in 2003. The data is found in the Statistics on Marriages and Divorces 2023 that was published by the Department of Statistics on July 15, 2024.\n\nIt is clear that with inter-ethnic marriages on the rise, more couples will have to navigate not just a new family, but a new culture and religion too.\n\nWhen my maternal grandparents married in 1953 at the Tamil Methodist Church in Short Street, my Chinese grandmother was promptly disowned by her family for marrying an Indian man.\n\nI often think of this when I stop to admire a black-and-white photograph of my grandparents hanging in the dining room. I like that it reminds me of my husband and me, a kind of full circle moment: two inter-ethnic marriages, 65 years apart. One bride lost her family; the other was embraced by a new one.\n\nI know my grandmother faced many of the same difficulties I did after marrying into an Indian family.\n\nLike me, she did not understand Tamil and was sometimes unwittingly left out of conversations among her in-laws.\n\nFor me, this has changed over the years as I got to know the family, and they got to know me. (And my husband’s reminders of “in English, please”!)\n\nAs our sixth wedding anniversary approaches and I reflect on our family life, I have come to realise a few things.\n\nMy husband and I have arrived at a happy (most of the time) medium. As Maroon 5 says: “It’s not always rainbows and butterflies, it’s compromise that moves us along.”\n\nMy marriage has helped me embrace my Indian heritage (my paternal grandparents were of mixed European and Asian lineage), and I have come to enjoy being a part of my husband’s cultural and religious traditions.\n\nI no longer feel like an “outsider” at the temple and have come to look forward to our visits, especially in the evenings, when the stone floor feels cool under my bare feet.\n\nI am now more comfortable in a saree and have learnt to explain the significance of certain Hindu rituals to my family and friends, who have learnt alongside me.\n\nI have developed an ear for the Tamil language and started to learn some Tamil with my twin boys.\n\nWe are looking forward to Deepavali, which involves early-morning oil baths, special prayers at home and receiving the blessings of elder family members.\n\nAs usual, we will be in matching family outfits specially tailored for Deepavali from fabric bought in India.\n\nBy Vanessa Paige Chelvan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ab93acdf75952e7c4f154ece1ad3401538a260b8224ba10b99fb607ef22a513f?w=825", "alt_text": "The writer and her husband were married in a Hindu ceremony at Sri Muneeswaran Temple in Queenstown in November 2018.

One dollar! Everything for one dollar!,” a raucous voice blared through the microphone, with a diction much closer to Telangana than Trafalgar Square.\n\nAs if the Sunday afternoon crowd of people squeezing past each other along the sidewalks of Serangoon Road wasn’t enough, here was a man intent on making everyone’s last-minute Deepavali shopping a truly maddening experience.\n\nTurns out, at the Crescent Mobile shop, ear pieces and bluetooth devices were all going for the low, low price of a single dollar. Not that the place was jam-packed with customers despite the jaw-dropping sale – but that’s what you get for trying to burst everyone’s eardrums.\n\nPerhaps the noise, crowds and 35 deg C heat was all in keeping with the “idyll” of Little India, days away from the Hindu Festival of Lights, arguably the most celebrated day on the calendar for Indians everywhere.\n\nIf Christmas is all winter decor and colourfully wrapped gifts in shopping bags along Orchard Road, Deepavali is mandalas (geometric patterns that follow a circular shape) and plastic bags filled with jars of murukku in Serangoon Road.\n\nThere is one constant between the two sacred occasions though – everyone shops at the last minute.\n\nOn a giant purple banner with the words “Deepavali Festival Village” above a tented enclosure, the disclaimer “enter at your own risk” should’ve been printed in not-so-fine print.\n\nI’ve been to a few arenas around the world for concerts and football matches and squeezed alongside thousands of people as we trekked from the street to the stadium seat. I was also once fortunate enough to attend a rock festival in Toronto, moshing with a crowd of 70,000, with no exit or toilet signs in sight.\n\nBut it was here, in Campbell Lane, in a narrow shopping alley no more than 200m long, where I learnt for a few harrowing minutes what claustrophobia – or life as a canned sardine – felt like.\n\nHanging from the tent’s ceiling were an endless array of garlands, trinkets and ornaments which suffocated the path even more. It didn’t make sense. With hundreds of people walking the stretch – no more than 3m wide – how could anyone stop to survey or purchase anything?\n\nYet, people did, causing anyone who was trailing to somehow push their way past or stop dead in their tracks. At one point, I stayed motionless for 15 seconds wondering if pedestrian horns might someday become a thing.\n\nIf India during the festive season is chaotic, then this was a microcosm of that very chaos. To say nothing of the fact that personal space does not translate into Indian culture for some reason – often giving the phrase “rubbing shoulders” almost a new meaning. Actually, you’d be thankful if it was just shoulders you were rubbing.\n\nBy the time I made it through to the other side, I gasped a breath of air and sat down next to a stall selling knock-off Gucci belts.\n\n“Ten dollars,” the vendor said right before he plugged a microphone into a speaker.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d9a3e705c93f315d24b9786778dc5e26b13c1d2eff063d51e5fffea7e181dd3f?w=825", "alt_text": "A tented enclosure in Campbell Lane where hundreds of shoppers squeezed into and walked at a snail’s pace."}]}

As we were exchanging contact numbers, I found myself flustered, having forgotten the lock-code to my iPhone. I admitted this to Mr Tata, who laughed heartily. That smile remains etched in my memory.”\n\nMr Tata, a billionaire and former chairman of the Tata Group, died in Mumbai on Oct 9 at the age of 86. He had been admitted to hospital due to age-related issues on Oct 7.\n\nNews of his death sent shockwaves not just in India but the world over.\n\nAdmired for his kindness, generosity and success, Mr Tata charmed people from all walks of life and all corners of the globe.\n\nMr Sameer, who was based in Singapore for three months in 2014 as he underwent an Airbus A320 type rating course, said he was surprised when Mr Tata contacted him soon after they met.\n\n“I was 23, and he was 76. I was amazed that such a distinguished man would remember me.\n\n“Being a pilot, one time I asked if I could see his helicopter. He obliged me and said, ‘The next time you visit, I will take you to the helipad, and we shall fly together’.\n\n“That’s how generous the man was.”\n\nMr Sameer said he got to ride the helicopter – and in Mr Tata’s Ferrari – soon after. Their last meeting was in April this year.\n\n“I had this feeling that was going to be our last time together, and sadly, it was. When I learned of his death, I travelled for hours to pay my respects to my good friend.”\n\nSingaporean Mark Chong, 45, who came to know Mr Tata through the course of business in the early 2000s, said the latter’s sense of humour made him a “vibrant individual to be around”.\n\n“I used to call him ‘Rhino’, while he referred to me as ‘Lizard’. I can’t help but feel emotional when I think about it,” said Mr Chong, who added that Mr Tata would send mangoes to him every year from India.\n\n“Whenever he was in Singapore, we would take the MRT together. Some people would recognise him and even touch his feet to receive his blessings. I was truly impressed by how he connected with everyone in such a genuine manner.”\n\nMr Chong said Mr Tata’s ethical approach to business and the endless charity work he would undertake always inspired him. “The charity he provided to the less fortunate spoke volumes of his character,” he said.\n\nHumility was another salient attribute of the man, according to Mr Malminderjit Singh, chairman of the Sikh Advisory Board and a corporate affairs consultant.\n\n“I knew Mr Tata when he served as chairman of the Institute of Societal Leadership at Singapore Management University, where I was the editorial and content head,” Mr Singh said.\n\n“He was always accessible, even as a global business icon. During our first conversation, he made an effort to connect with me. I mentioned that I was a third-generation Singaporean, and he responded by sharing that his ancestors were also immigrants. He didn’t have to do that, but he recognised my nervousness and wanted to make me feel at ease.\n\n“He also stressed the importance of giving back to the community, a value that has stayed with me.”\n\nSingaporean Mark Chong (above), 45, who knew Mr Ratan Tata through the course of business.\n\nA memorial altar at the Tata Power helicopter hangar in India for late industrialist Ratan Tata.\n\n“Whenever he was in Singapore, we would take the MRT together.

Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nWhen I arrive at Sri Mariamman Temple in South Bridge Road around 4pm last Sunday, bare-chested volunteers decked in orange dhoti (cloth worn around the waist) are hosing down the temple walls to keep it cool.\n\nLooking at some of the spectators perspiring in the makeshift stands surrounding the temple’s quadrangle, it seems some of them could use a cooling down as well.\n\nMetres away from a burning fire pit, devotees arrive at Sri Mariamman –  Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple founded in 1827 – as early as 2pm. They are there to witness Theemithi, a fire-walking ceremony where devotees walk barefoot on burning embers as a form of penance or thanksgiving to the goddess Sri Drowpathai Amman.\n\nThe fire pit has been burning since just after sunrise. More than 22,000 pieces of wood – added layer after layer – are being used for the pit, measuring 18 feet (5.4m) in length to symbolise the 18 days of the war between two royal families in the Sanskrit epic, Mahabharata.\n\nThe festival re-enacts episodes from the Mahabharata, which include recitals of chapters in Tamil. Preparations typically begin weeks before – with a flag-hoisting ceremony – and culminates in the fire-walking event, which usually takes place on a Sunday, a week before Deepavali.\n\nThe fire walk, however, is traditionally for males only, although pre-event ceremonies – such as the carrying of milk pots, prostrations and rolling on the temple floor while engaged in prayer – are open to both men and women.\n\nBy 6pm, the stands on the north and east sides of the temple are packed to the rafters. Crowds have also formed on the ground level behind barriers as everyone awaits the arrival of the chief priest, who is making the 4km-walk from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road with an entourage in tow and a sacred vessel – or karagam – consisting of rice, lemon and a gold coin, atop his head.\n\nThe man of the hour arrives on time, with Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong in his company. Curiously, Mr Tong isn’t the only Chinese individual at the temple – there are a handful of Chinese devotees too participating in the ceremony.\n\n“Om Shakti! Om Shakti!”, the crowd chants as the priest prepares for his walk of faith. He does a dance while balancing the karagam on his head, smiles as he stares at the pit, and walks – without too much of a rush –  across the burning ashes. The crowd cheers.\n\nThe devotees then make their trek across the pit. Their methods and mannerisms vary.\n\nSome of them prostrate in front of the fire pit before walking, others simply close their eyes and mutter a prayer to themselves. Some raise their hands up as they walk, others run. Some of them dip their feet into the milk pit at the end of the stretch, some simply hop across the pool.\n\n“You feel the heat on the soles, but once you cross and step into the milk, the burning sensation ceases,” explains Mr V. Thilak, who is seated next to me in the stands.\n\nThe 44-year-old Singaporean is a spectator today, but he lets me know rather proudly the number of times he’s done the fire-walk.\n\n“I’ve fire-walked six times; my first time, I was 18,” he tells me. “There’s a mixed feeling of fear and elation as you are about to do it.\n\n“One time, it did hurt quite a bit. I walked around the temple just so I could feel the sensation return to my feet. I had very mild burns and blisters after that, but I applied turmeric paste and it was fine after two days.”\n\nHas anyone ever been seriously hurt before? I ask him.\n\n“Well, that’s why there are first-aid stations right outside the temple,” he replies.\n\nAnd has anyone ever tripped and fell on the heap of burning embers?\n\nMr Thilak nods. “But they are alert to such things,” he says, pointing to the volunteers standing along the breadth of the fire pit. “If someone falls, they are very quick to help the person up.\n\n“But as a devotee, you mustn’t borrow grief from the future. The act is about faith. You must have it before and as you walk.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3d49eb9822665400b20e592e292da8a873e5b24410ba1f2cbdd8e213bc340322?w=825", "alt_text": "Some 22,000 pieces of wood are used for the fire pit during Theemithi."}]}

Mahalingam was doing the same – though not for the ritual itself, but for a special musical performance.\n\nOn the nights of Oct 18 and 19, Mahalingam performed at the temple for over three hours each night, captivating a crowd of around 3,500 people in total. Among the 100 or so devotional songs performed were 10 original compositions penned specially for the occasion.\n\n“From the moment we were booked for this event four months ago, my team and I thought about how to arrange the songs to suit the energy of the crowd,” the 41-year-old told tabla!\n\n“It’s a privilege to perform at Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple for such an important festival. Singing these devotional songs is like invoking a divine presence; people feel something beyond words.”\n\nHailing from Sivagangai in Tamil Nadu, Mahalingam is a well-known figure in India’s folk and devotional music scene, with hundreds of songs recorded in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu.\n\nHe has performed more than 1,500 concerts in India and abroad. He also performed in Singapore in 2022 as a part of Indian music composer D. Imman’s concert.\n\nHis journey into the world of music began at a young age thanks to his family’s musical roots.\n\n“I grew up with my mother singing kummi pattu (folk songs in Tamil),” he said. “Whenever there was an event, like a wedding or ear-piercing ceremony, I’d rush to the microphone and sing the traditional songs of our time.”\n\nHis grandfather, a devout man who sang lullabies for the goddess Mariamman, nurtured Mahalingam’s musical upbringing.\n\n“He would sing throughout the night during rituals, and that’s how I was brought up – always surrounded by singing.”\n\nAfter working various odd jobs for several years, his big break came in 2009 when he recorded his first song for a Tamil film, marking the start of his playback-singing career.\n\nHe has since sung for numerous films and worked with prominent music directors including A.R. Rahman, Ilayaraja and Yuvan Shankar Raja.\n\n“I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the greatest people in the music industry. They’ve all been very supportive, which has helped me grow as a singer,” he said.\n\nDespite his success in the film industry, Mahalingam said his heart remains rooted in devotional and folk music.\n\n“People often say that music originated from the villages, and I truly believe that,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0fb38857c6c604e93aaff568d7d0da40d178a1955e079d79419a394608434c80?w=825", "alt_text": "Singer V.M.

Measurements of facial proportions are done with standards Greek scholars applied while trying to define beauty with scientific formulae.\n\nAccording to Dr Debraj Shome, director and senior cosmetic surgeon at The Esthetic Clinics in Mumbai, the golden ratio, approximately 1.618, is a mathematical formula used to assess facial attractiveness.\n\n“The distance from the top of the nose to the centre of the lips needs to be 1.618 times the distance from the centre of the lips to the chin. When it comes to this ratio, it is believed that, if the distance between one’s eyebrows is 1, then the entire length of an eyebrow has to be 1.618 to be able to categorise one as appealing,” he told The Indian Express.\n\nFacial features aligning with this ratio are perceived as aesthetically pleasing due to their visual balance.\n\nAccording to the “golden ratio” measurements, Deepika, who ranks ninth, has a face that is 91.22 per cent perfect.\n\nThe list, unveiled by London’s top facial plastic surgeon Julian De Silva, is led by British Academy Television Award and Primetime Emmy Award winner Jodie Comer, and includes American singer and actress Ariana Grande, American fashion model Bella Hadid and American media personality and socialite Kim Kardashian.\n\nBritain’s Daily Mail reported that Jodie’s eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin, jaw and facial shape were found to be 94.52 per cent accurate.\n\nAfter Jodie, the list includes Zendaya with 94.37 per cent and Hadid with 94.34. They are followed by Beyonce – 92.44, Ariana – 91.81, Taylor Swift – 91.64 and Kardashian – 91.28.\n\nOn the list of most handsome men, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, often hailed as one of the most handsome actors globally, secured the 10th spot.\n\nHe achievied an impressive facial symmetry score of 86.76 per cent, making him the only Indian actor on the list.\n\nBritish actor Aaron Taylor Johnson topped the men’s list, with a facial symmetry of 93.04 per cent.\n\nThe top-10 ranking speaks volumes of Deepika’s unmatchable charm, which not only captivates on screen but is also recognised by science.\n\nShe has a huge fan following across the globe thanks to several international projects, including the 2017 film XXX: Return of Xander Cage, which she starred in alongside Vin Diesel.\n\nShe has also appeared on the cover of Vogue along with Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson and South Korean actress Doona Bae.\n\nDeepika, who recently welcomed her first child – a baby girl with actor-husband Ranveer Singh – will be next seen in Singham Again.\n\nHelmed by Rohit Shetty, the film, which also stars Ranveer, Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff, is the third instalment of the super-hit Singham franchise.\n\nDeepika plays the role of a ruthless cop named Shakti Shetty.\n\nSingham, released in 2011, and Singham Returns (2014), were box-office hits. Singham Again is set to hit the big screens on Nov 1.\n\n“The distance from the top of the nose to the centre of the lips needs to be 1.618 times the distance from the centre of the lips to the chin.”\n\nDr Debraj Shome, director and senior cosmetic surgeon at The Esthetic Clinics in Mumbai", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/41adc44b903dcc8a9f42f5d8de611dcca485f6c667bdcbbafd55ae639e6140db?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

This is the sign of mutual understanding.”\n\nMr Pradhan and PM Wong discussed opportunities for internship programmes that would allow Indian students to gain practical experience in Singaporean companies, as well as the possibility of twinning Indian and Singaporean schools and universities.\n\nWhile referring to Singapore as India’s trusted knowledge partner, Mr Pradhan said the way to expand the connection is through three critical pillars: talent, resource and market.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/77344634151d053484f778afa03da143c4c43c7eb1a8f8b5c256b7b7f965e8cc?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Dharmendra Pradhan (third from left) meeting IIT and IIM alumni in Singapore."}]}

At the time, he was the only turbaned Sikh referee in the world.\n\nHe “set a significant milestone for Singapore”, the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) said in a tribute to Dhillon.\n\n“As a referee, he was extremely dedicated and hardworking and was always ready to represent Singapore when duty called,” said Fifa referee T.

He shook hands, posed for photos and even gave a few female fans kisses on the hand.\n\nThere were many Malay and Indonesian fans in attendance, a testament to the far-reaching impact of Udit’s songs – many of which were from popular Shah Rukh Khan movies.\n\nMs Haryati Ali, 38, who attended the show with two friends, said: “We grew up with Bollywood songs, especially those of Shah Rukh Khan.”\n\nUdit himself felt the love from the audience. With a bow, he said: “I am thankful for all your blessings. I am your Udit Narayan.”\n\nBefore Udit hit the stage, his son Aditya thrilled the audience with several up-tempo numbers, transforming the theatre venue into a dance floor.\n\nBy popular request, Udit sang a few lines in Tamil from ‘Sahana’, a song from the Rajinikanth movie Sivaji, but it was a mere shade of the original. Concertgoer Rivesha Kalaichelvan said: “Two or three more Tamil songs would have been nice.”\n\nMs Kajol Vatwani, who paid a total of $1,600 for diamond category tickets for her family of four, felt she got her money’s worth: “We really enjoyed it, especially the Udit-Aditya duet and guest singers from Malaysia.”\n\nThe concert ended on a crescendo as the audience put their hands up and swayed to Om Shanti Om.\n\nUdit will perform live in Malaysia at the Spice Arena in Penang on Nov 28.\n\nUdit Narayan at The Star Theatre.\n\nPhoto: Ravi Singaram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d0a640bf75c35d74d3003434d97e5c5b7ab5e2cc153e6cc146247bf676b07451?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

No offence to anyone – the idea was to take advantage of the focus on the US presidential election and boost our brand.”\n\nMr Patro used to run 11 restaurants across Singapore until Covid reduced the number to four.\n\nChef Akhil Prabhu, who came up with the Kamala turkey recipe, pointed out that kamal means lotus in Sanskrit and he has used its root to make the paste.\n\nHe has also added Harissa, a North African chilli sauce made with garlic, olive oil, citrus and a few warm spices.\n\n“I cook it slowly and then roast it,” said the chef, who is famous for his fusion food. “Then I keep it in the tandoor. The turkey is actually a satire of our times.”\n\nAkhil has also come up with a Trump Roasted ‘Maga’ Lamb  ($225), named after the Republican candidate, to make the serving even.\n\n“It is liberally coated with ‘Maga’ (Make America Great Again) pumpkin seeds and carries a lot of punch,” said Mr Akhil.\n\nTurkey is not typical Deepavali food, so he is not sure how many Indians will buy it. “I chose turkey because it is a celebratory roast and I prefer it to putting chunks of chicken in a sauce. It is meant for all who want to celebrate Deepavali differently.”\n\nSo far, orders have been placed for three Kamala turkeys and four Trump lamb legs. “It was our Chinese customers who placed those orders,” said Akhil. “I expect sales to pick up over the weekend.”\n\nThe orders have to be placed in advance as it takes three days to marinate the Kamala turkey, and it will be available only till Oct 31.\n\nCall 9416650 to place an order for Kamala Harissa Tandoori Turkey or Trump Roasted ‘Maga’ Lamb.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6556ead2b94c3c2f037b1cfc24c8d5bfbfcd169369fcee95419d11b231063139?w=825", "alt_text": "Kamala Harissa Tandoori turkey"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nGiven the saturated Indian shopping festival market in Singapore, Mr Abdul Malieq Abdul Salam, owner of Shaabaz Events Hub, hit upon a new strategy this October.\n\nHe organised the Asian Festival Village from Oct 3 to 6 at Singapore Expo, which focused not only on Indian culture and ethnic wear, but also incorporated the styles and flavours of Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand and Japan.\n\nIt was a departure from the consumer exhibitions he had organised since 2012, which were targeted at Indian expats.\n\n“It was a bit challenging for us because a lot of Indian events take place in Singapore close to Deepavali,” said the 43-year-old entrepreneur.\n\n“So we created a new brand that appeals to everybody. The response was good, we saw more than 20,000 people from different races attend the event.”\n\nMr Malieq said he was forced to change his concept because the “spending powers of individuals is limited, with different organisers trying to tap into the market”.\n\n“Unless you have a good concept, no one will come,” he said. “People want value for their money and they always look at which artiste is performing (at the bazaar) and which brands are there.\n\n“People are getting tired of attending the same shows. So I told my vendors they could bring their Diwali decorations and dresses, but they should be modernised. The different designs should also attract the Filipinos and other communities in Singapore. That is what I’m keen on.”\n\nAt one time, Mr Malieq used to organise six exhibitions a year. He has since reduced them to three. “Quality is what matters,” he said.\n\nMs Shagun Chand, who organises the NRI Buzzar twice a year, agreed it’s important to provide an “unforgettable and unique shopping experience”.\n\n“Our shopping festival goes beyond showcasing products and giving the best prices,” she said. “It also involves networking and integration. There is excellent food, wine and music – it’s a celebration of craftsmanship and community.”\n\nThe NRI Buzzar shopping festival she organised with her partner Chandni Jain at the Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre on Oct 8 attracted around 8,500 people.\n\n“We had 89 vendors providing lifestyle items like clothes and jewellery, as well as food. There was something for everyone,” she said.\n\nThe competition does not worry her. “There is a space for everyone; the key is to think of new ideas. Your product should speak for itself,” she said.\n\nDirect dealing is also the secret behind Zak Salaam India’s success, said its Singapore representative Muhammad Fazil.\n\nThe Chennai-based company has been organising Indian shopping festivals in Singapore for the past 17 years, and has found the market growing.\n\n“It’s all about doing away with middlemen and bringing the product straight from the factory to consumers,” said Mr Fazil, 35.\n\nZak Salaam India does three events a year – around the time of Hari Raya Puasa, Aadi and Deepavali. This year, it also did a Pongal event in January.\n\nIts latest shopping festival from Oct 10 to 13 at Singapore Expo attracted some 62,000 visitors.\n\n“People are getting tired of attending the same shows.

Financial constraints and societal expectations were constant hurdles. Yet, her parents, who never imposed gender-based limits, stood firmly by her side.\n\n“They were lectured on how to bring up girls, how girls were not supposed to take up such risks or be so independent. But my parents never set any limits for me,” Salva told The Hindu.\n\n“From an early age, I have been driven, self-confident and fully dedicated to honing my skills and taking my career to new heights.”\n\nSalva began her racing career in 2017 by competing in the Formula LGB Racing in India – a single seater, open wheel class. She then participated in the F4 Indian Championship and the F4 UAE Championship in 2023.\n\nHer good performances earned her a place in the Formula 1 Academy.\n\nSalva acknowledged the emotional and physical toll high-level racing has taken on her.\n\n“You have to know yourself,” she said. “I have been through a lot of ups and downs. Living your dream is a challenge, but I still believe in myself. Those who never try are the ones who fail.”\n\nThe expensive nature of F4 training held back Salva for a while, but she worked several jobs and even became an entrepreneur to save enough money for those high-intensity sessions.\n\nShe is currently the brand ambassador for Next Level Racing, which partially sponsors her training expenses.\n\n“Representing my country in formula racing is my ultimate goal, and I am determined to compete at the highest levels, from F4 and F3 to F2 and, eventually, F1,” she said on her official website.\n\n“As a female athlete, I am particularly motivated to challenge the norms and make a significant impact in a field that has historically been male-dominated.”\n\nIf Salva qualifies from the F1 Academy, she will not have to worry about sponsorship as the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, the governing body of motor sport,  has a policy of supporting women racers.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1e406302672eae747c1cc6fe7847a3c4b979e184339eb0250c6de244edf8212b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

She has already started racing in Europe, in races organised by the all-female championship F1 Academy in Spain and Italy.\n\n“How many times people have asked me about allowing my daughter to race? Many times,” says Kuldeep with a laugh.\n\n“They’ll ask me: ‘Are you okay? Are you sure you want your daughter to do this? You know she’s going so fast, she’s going to crash.’ I just tell them it’s okay, don’t worry.”\n\nThe businessman says he’s convinced of the decision to allow Kareen to race every time he witnesses her passion for the sport.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of improvements over the years, with her discipline especially, and it’s because of racing. When it comes to training every day, she never says no. I’ve seen some kids say things like ‘I’m tired’ after a while – but not her.”\n\nKareen’s obsession with motor sports and cars began at a young age. As a child, she would accompany her father, a sports car enthusiast and F1 fan, to test drives at car showrooms, and was drawn to the sounds of the different engines.\n\nHer karting journey began at nine, when she was having lunch at Turf City in Bukit Timah and the karting track caught her eye.\n\n“When the instructor was telling her about the kart, she was like ‘I know, I know.’ No one taught her where the brakes and accelerator are, how did she know all that, I thought,” Kuldeep says.\n\nKareen, who is a fan of Red Bull’s F1 world champion Max Verstappen, finished first in her first ever casual race. And then again when she was brought to another karting track in Jurong. Eventually, she was spotted and picked up by a racing team.\n\nAt this point, the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) Secondary 2 student was hooked.\n\n“I love the adrenaline rush,” she says. “Whenever my dad used to go fast while driving, I used to enjoy that, and I get that feeling wherever I’m in the kart as well.”\n\nHer young career hasn’t been without thrills and spills.\n\nDuring a race in Dubai earlier this month, a fellow driver crashed into her and Kareen injured her hand. Despite this, she hopped back into her kart and raced on, surprising even her father who had advised her to sit out the rest of the race.\n\n“Yes, accidents will happen but they are learning experiences,” says Kareen. “In this sport, you have to be brave.”\n\nKareen also cites her mother as a pillar of support. Though she doesn’t accompany her for overseas competitions, Kiranjit, a 45-year-old teacher, watches her race via live streams and calls Kareen right after.\n\nAdmittedly not a sports fan, Kiran says she’s surprised to this day that things have come along so far.\n\n“I didn’t expect it to go this big, honestly,” Kiran says, adding that Kareen’s grandparents are also supportive of her racing ambitions.\n\n“When she started off, I was just like, ‘Okay’.

Santosh Kumar\n\nWriter Benny Daniels said he only wanted to bring out the pain and struggles of an individual when he wrote the Malayalam novel Aadujeevitham (which means Goat’s Life), and did not intend to stir any controversy.\n\nHis book, which was made into the film The Goat’s Life and is available on Netflix, has raised a huge debate over the treatment of migrant workers in Gulf countries.\n\nIt tells the survival story of Kerala native Najeeb Muhammad, who worked as a “modern slave” tending hundreds of goats single-handedly in a gulf desert village for two years in the 1990s before he escaped and returned home.\n\n“My intention was only to bring out the sufferings of people who are unable to voice them out,” said Daniels, 53, who goes by the pen name Benyamin, during a visit to Singapore last week.\n\n“I want to resonate their sounds through my stories. There are so many people around the globe who have their own pains, struggles and issues. I just want to portray those in a meaningful way.”\n\nBenyamin met Najeeb in Bahrain 10 years after the migrant worker’s ordeal. It took the writer more than a year to coax out the real-life survival story from the Kerala fisherman, who had gone to the Gulf seeking better prospects.\n\nNajeeb’s heartbreaking tale of being forced to lead a life “lower than that of a goat” instantly hooked Benyamin, who also hails from Kerala and has a fascination for depicting the stories of lonely migrants.\n\nStark and dramatic elements from Najeeb’s painful solitude is visible on every page of Benyamin’s 43-chapter book.\n\n“I worked in the Gulf for 21 years and I met so many people who were suffering,” said Benyamin, who has authored about 30 books in various genres.\n\n“As a storyteller, I believe it is my duty to tell the world about such people. I met Najeeb accidentally and I learnt from him what he suffered in the desert. It was so touching and I knew I had to write the story.”\n\nBenyamin added fictional elements to the real-life saga to make the book more lively.\n\n“It is not a biography or autobiography,” said the author. “I put my own vision, my own pain, my own fear... in the novel... to add to the flavour. Not surprisingly, it resonated with many people around the world and India, including techies in Bengaluru who said they are also suffering in glass and concrete prisons.”\n\nThe book, published in 2008, has sold more than 270,000 copies and is on the syllabus of universities across India. The English version, Goat Days, was published in 2013 and has been translated into nine languages.\n\nIt took 16 years to complete the film. Benyamin said it was because “Malayalam is a small language”.\n\n“The budget to do a film is so high and we needed a producer. Moreover, we wanted a dedicated actor who could lose weight for the role (lead actor Prithviraj Sukumaran actually shed 31kg).\n\n“We went through so many problems, including not getting approval to shoot in any of the Gulf countries. So we went to Jordan.”\n\nEventually, the crew recreated Najeeb’s West Asian sandy solitary confinement in the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan and in the depths of the Sahara desert in Algeria.\n\nThough Benyamin never named the country where Najeeb’s torture unfolded, the book was banned in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFilmmaker Blessy Ipe Thomas, widely known as Blessy, came out with The Goat Life in March, and the film became one of the highest-grossing works in Malayalam cinema and won several top honours at the Kerala State Film Awards, including best director, best adapted screenplay and best actor.\n\nThough he doesn’t have a formal screenplay credit, Benyamin, who leads a simple life in Kerala’s Pandalam municipality, said he was closely associated with the film from start to finish, adding that Blessy and the actors frequently looked to him for clarifications and suggestions.\n\n“It is my movie too. It’s not that I just gave them the story and left,” he said. “Blessy has captured the essence of the book, as not all 43 chapters can be shown in the film.\n\n“What the film has done is make people aware that some people are doing bad things to others and that must be stopped. The movie is a social eye-opener.”\n\n“I met Najeeb accidentally and I learnt from him what he suffered in the desert. It was so touching, and I knew I had to write the story.”\n\nAuthor Benyamin (left) signing a copy of his book in Singapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9629a20c3732a98cf6e0b1866c3040bcde6ce72a0bca82a2a2c456e63c0a1e0c?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

I want to see my mother one last time. I need to return to India for the last rites, but I don’t know what to do. It’s close to the end of the month, so I don’t have money.”\n\nThis is one example of the various struggles migrant workers in Singapore face. Whether it is missing family or dealing with the burden of paying off debts back home or getting a call informing that a loved one has died, workers’ emotions are in constant turmoil. For them, such woes and distractions may lead to serious – even fatal – lapses at work.\n\n“This is precisely why it’s so important migrant workers do not suffer in silence,” said Mr Saravanan, who took part in the Walk Your Way To Better Health event at West Coast Park on Oct 13.\n\nThe 2km walk was organised by the Ministry of Manpower’s Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group, along with partners such as HealthServe, Passion To Serve, 24asia, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and Big At Heart, in celebration of World Mental Health Day.\n\nThe walk brought together 312 people, including some 250 migrant workers.\n\nWorkers participated in games and a yoga session, and were taken to Penjuru Recreation Centre for a mental health roadshow.\n\nACE Group chief Tung Yui Fai addressed the workers: “We want all of you to find friends and talk to each other. We have some peer support leaders (PSL) here too. These are your friends who live in the dorm, so when you have problems, you can talk to them.”\n\nThe PSL scheme was started in 2021 by HealthServe, a charity dedicated to migrant workers, and has provided psychological first-aid training to more than 1,200 migrant workers.\n\nMr Saravanan has served as a PSL for the past two years.\n\nIn the case of that dormitory mate who needed to return home, Mr Saravanan donated $300 and collected funds from his supervisors and co-workers to buy a plane ticket.\n\nAt Fortis Construction, which has around 2,800 migrants working for them, initiatives are in place to safeguard their mental health. The company recently held a roadshow at its worksite to educate workers on good mental health initiatives.\n\nMr Guru Sangarathas, 44, safety manager at Fortis Construction, said: “We have a mental health first-aider programme, where we check in with our migrant brothers every week.\n\n“We also have a gym with professional trainers at the dormitory as well as prayer rooms, and we cater freshly prepared meals for them.”\n\nOne of the highlights at the Penjuru roadshow was the personalised physiotherapy sessions conducted by SIT’s physiotherapy faculty, students and alumni.\n\nAssistant Professor Audrey Lim Ei-Ping, who leads the SIT physiotherapy team, said: “This is not the first time the SIT physiotherapy team and SITIntegrates are doing an outreach like this, but this is on a much larger scale.\n\n“Besides treatment, we also teach them some exercises to prevent injuries or pain from worsening. If workers are not in a good physical condition, it increases mental stress.”\n\nSITIntegrates, a student-led group focusing on community integration for migrant workers, also created a giant Jenga game. This was part of SIT’s 10 Acts for Good – a year-long initiative to commemorate the institution’s 10th anniversary as an autonomous university.\n\nMs Kiran Kaur, 22, the head of publicity for SITIntegrates, said: “Many migrant workers face communication barriers with their supervisors and this leads to them being scolded often, which may impact their mental health.\n\n“I hope they can be better understood because they contribute a lot to Singapore.”\n\nMigrant workers who need urgent help can call HealthServe’s 24-hour helpline at 3129 5000 or the Migrant Workers’ Centre at 6536 2692.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f449146752a46c4cbee1556f8148eb1a589fa278ef0e467f93af7bb8cb7a1978?w=825", "alt_text": "SIT students conducting personalized physiotherapy sessions for migrant workers at Penjuru Recreation Centre as part of the institute’s 10 Acts for Good initiative."}]}

The orders reportedly came from Bishnoi, who was locked up in Delhi’s Tihar Jail at the time.\n\nBishnoi is now in Sabarmati jail in Gujarat booked for 12 different cases, reported India Today.\n\nWhat makes Bishnoi’s story even more chilling is his growing focus on Bollywood.\n\nFollowing Moose Wala’s murder, one of Bishnoi’s shooters, Saurabh, alias Mahakal, revealed to police that Bishnoi is intent on extending his criminal empire into Mumbai’s entertainment industry.\n\nHis goal: To establish fear and dominance in Bollywood.\n\nLawrence Bishnoi\n\nPhoto: X\n\n(Bishnoi) has risen to become one of the most feared gangsters in India, allegedly operating with “impunity” from a Gujarat prison.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/619a8aeb8605d380aa5a7fbd810c876b6cdf32ab08c5154ab632f47966c5d98a?w=825", "alt_text": "Lawrence Bishnoi (middle)."}]}

I expect (my coming trip) to be a very beautiful experience.”\n\nThe 18-year-old, who is the world No. 5, has had an amazing run this year, playing a stellar role in India’s Chess Olympiad win in Budapest in September and becoming the youngest player to win the Candidates tournament in April, which earned him a shot at the world title.\n\nThe Chennai-based player said he’s ready to take on Ding, 31, at Resorts World Sentosa.\n\n“It’ll be an interesting match for sure. We are both strong players,” said Gukesh. “There’ll be a lot of exciting games. I’m really looking forward to the match.”\n\nThe World Championship match consists of 14 games, with the winner being the first player to score 7½.\n\nDing has not been in great form over the past 18 months, openly citing his struggles with mental fatigue and personal distress. But Gukesh said there won’t be any let up in his preparation.\n\n“I have a team (led by Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski) and we are preparing hard,” he said. “I’m focusing on the process, and I’ll try to be at my best every day and play a good game.\n\n“At the top level, it all boils down to the minute details and minor differences between the players. I’m trying my best to analyse them and use them to my advantage.”\n\nGukesh admitted his youth could prove to be a double-edged sword during the title match.\n\n“Because of my young age, I think I have more energy compared with more experienced players (like Ding),” he said. “And it’s easier for me to stay focused during long tournaments.\n\n“But there are pros and cons. The disadvantage is obviously that I’m not as experienced and have not played as much as them. I don’t have as much knowledge as them.”\n\nPlaying for India at such a young age has added to Gukesh’s confidence.\n\n“I’m glad a lot of people are supportive,” he said. “How I handle pressure is mostly through experience.

Except that, instead of Groundhog Day, it’s Ganesh Chaturthi, Onam, Kailpodh, Navaratri, Deepavali – all in rapid succession.\n\nThe multicultural calendar: Why stop at one festival?\n\nIn Singapore, festivals seem to come at you like buses. You wait for one and then six arrive at the same time, each with its own dietary restrictions, dress code and volume settings.\n\nThis year, I finally made peace with the fact that, for nine months of the year, our weekends belong to Netflix, and for the other three, they belong to the Gods.\n\nTake Ganesh Chaturthi. Most communities love our Sukh Karta, Dukh Harta, roly-poly Elephant God riding on his cute mouse. For decor, we are talking massive, lovingly-decorated Ganeshas taking over every corner of the house.\n\nThen comes the long list of relatives, each with her own version of how to perfect the modak. You just need to nod at every aunty appreciatively and eat the yummy modaks before they disappear – the modaks, I mean, not the aunties.\n\nBut, before the last crumb of Ganesh’s offering has even been consumed, Onam storms in.\n\nOnam: The home stretch... and the banana leaf\n\nOnam is like the Malayalam version of Thanksgiving but on steroids.\n\nYou’ve got to cook a 20-dish Onam sadhya – a feast served on banana leaves, with no cutlery allowed. Luckily I do not cook, I only eat.\n\nOnam also involves dressing up in the traditional white and gold sari, except here’s the rub: After days of eating festival food, no sari is designed to hide what the payasam has done to your waistline!\n\nNavaratri: The festival of dolls and dance\n\nNavaratri isn’t just about fasting and prayers, it’s also the time for golu, a tradition where dolls of gods, goddesses and sometimes random animals are arranged on a multi-tiered platform. It’s basically a miniature version of Indian mythology meets DIY arts and crafts.\n\nEach year, dolls are dug up from storage. Some dolls are chipped, others look like they have been through the wars, and there’s always the odd rogue animal figure that’s somehow squeezed in.\n\nThis year’s surprise? A Barbie doll someone’s child added to the display, right next to Lord Krishna.\n\nNavaratri is its own universe. Nine days of fasting, feasting, dressing up, singing Mataji Na Garba and dancing in huge crowds, getting hit in the wrong places by dandia sticks! Jai Ambe!\n\nDeepavali: A higher level of celebration\n\nAnd just when you think you’ve made it through the whirlwind of pujas and prasad, Deepavali is just around the corner, the final boss of the Indian festival season.\n\nLittle India lights up with huge peacock decor, shops glow with decorations and aunties are out in full force, discussing this year’s sari trends as if it’s a competition to out-sparkle the lights themselves.\n\nThe preparation is another level altogether. Homes, for instance, are scrubbed from top to bottom – because, apparently, Goddess Lakshmi checks every corner before deciding if you’re worthy of her blessings.\n\nNew clothes are bought and plans for elaborate, catered meals are enthusiastically discussed.\n\nMeanwhile, the kids are interested only in how many sparklers and fireworks they can set off without parental intervention.\n\nThe beauty of celebrating Deepavali in Singapore lies in its community spirit. From organising rangoli competitions to potluck dinners, it’s an experience that binds everyone in the joy of togetherness – even if we are all simultaneously navigating traffic jams to get from one gathering to another.\n\nSurvival tips for festival frenzy\n\nSo, how does one survive this Singaporean festival frenzy? Well, here are a few lessons I’ve picked up:\n\nLearn the art of timing:\n\nEvery family member will tell you that each festival has “just one important day”, but they are lying.\n\nFestivals stretch into weeks:\n\nPace yourself. It’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon – with plenty of fried snacks at every rest stop.\n\nMaster the multi-cuisine cook-off\n\n: At one point, you’ll have to balance modak, vadai, payasam, all on the same day. Channel your inner MasterChef, or better yet, find a good caterer.\n\nSari superpowers\n\n: Invest in good sari pleats and stronger safety pins. You’ll need them when sprinting between Navaratri golus and Onam sadhyas.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Singapore, where every community takes its festivals seriously, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But, once you embrace the chaos, there is a certain joy in seeing how these traditions collide, overlap and create new memories.\n\nAnd, if nothing else, there’s always next weekend to recover!\n\nOh, what’s that I hear already? Jingle bells, jingle bells playing in the malls...", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/33592517b286b42d8f0ac76af0f509ba6f6c687b5eaa0ff046a9ca0df155e942?w=825", "alt_text": "A golu display."}]}

Their hostility stems from the actor’s involvement in a 1998 blackbuck poaching case.\n\nThe blackbuck is a sacred animal to the Bishnoi community, and the gang’s leader, Lawrence Bishnoi, reportedly vowed revenge on the actor following the incident.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bharatiya Janata Party MP Harnath Singh Yadav accused Salman of killing a blackbuck, cooking it and eating it. He asked the actor to apologise for his actions, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\n“People make mistakes. You are a big actor, a large number of people in the country love you,” said Mr Yadav. “My good advice to you is that you should respect the sentiments of the Bishnoi community and apologise to them for your big mistake.”\n\nThe threats to Salman resurfaced earlier this year when gunfire was reported outside his house, leading authorities to further intensify security around him.\n\nThe murder of Mr Siddique, a three-time legislator and former Maharashtra minister, has only compounded the risks for Salman. They have been close associates for more than two decades, and this was well-known in both political and Bollywood circles.\n\nOn Oct 12, Salman rushed to the hospital to console Mr Siddique’s grieving family.

It charged Sanjoy Roy, who used to work with the Kolkata Police as a contractual staff, with the rape and murder of the 31-year-old on-duty doctor.\n\nThe statements of about 200 people were recorded in the charge sheet, according to NDTV.\n\nThe CBI followed the Kolkata Police’s line of investigation and relied on digital and material evidence to establish Roy’s presence at the scene of the crime.\n\nCCTV footage was used to establish his movement from 3.34am on the day of the crime (Aug 9), when he was seen at the entrance of the trauma centre building “wearing a T-shirt and jeans, holding a helmet in his left hand with Bluetooth neckband earphones around his neck”.\n\nA Bluetooth neckband earphone was seized by local police from the scene of the crime on Aug 9. This was used as a crucial piece of evidence to nail and arrest Roy a day after the crime.\n\nCall details from Roy’s mobile number also corroborated his presence at the hospital at the time of the crime.\n\nThe physical evidence collected include Roy’s blood, saliva and hair – all found at the scene of the crime.\n\nAccording to the CBI, the woman died due to asphyxia, resulting from a combined effect of throttling and smothering.\n\n“The injuries related to the hymen, which were fresh in origin, clearly indicate that the victim had suffered forceful penetrative sexual assault,” the charge sheet noted.\n\nInjuries found on the accused’s body indicated the use of blunt force consistent with signs of resistance by the victim.\n\nOn Monday, a Kolkata court took cognisance of the charge sheet and decided that Roy’s trial would be held in-camera, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\nThe court also fixed Nov 4 as the date for the framing of charges, an important step towards delivering justice to the young doctor and her family.\n\nRoy spoke in court for the first time on Tuesday and said: “If I don’t speak, all the blame will be put on me. I don’t know anything about the case, I am innocent.”\n\nBut the brutality of his alleged acts has already sent ripples of horror across the country, with the Supreme Court saying the case had “shocked the conscience of the nation”.\n\nThe outrage was compounded by allegations that senior hospital staff had tried to cover up the incident. The then head of the hospital, Sandip Ghosh, allegedly made the victim’s family wait several hours before allowing them to see her body, and they were initially informed she had taken her own life. Ghosh was later arrested on charges of tampering with evidence.\n\nThe hospital was said to have taken 14 hours to file a police report. The parents of the doctor alleged that police had also attempted to cover up the crime and bribe them to stay quiet.\n\nThe brutality of the murder and allegations of a cover-up prompted mass protests across the country and a lengthy strike by junior doctors in Kolkata, who demanded that the state government do more to protect their safety in hospitals and ensure justice for the victim.\n\n“If I don’t speak, all the blame will be put on me.

Santosh Kumar\n\nRespected Indian industrialist Ratan Tata, who died from health complications on Oct 9 aged 86 in Mumbai, had a close relationship with Singapore, exemplified by the honorary citizenship he was given on Aug 29, 2008.\n\nThe then chairman of the Tata Group, who helmed the conglomerate for more than 20 years, was given that honour in recognition of his abiding business relationship with Singapore and his contribution to the growth of high-tech sectors here.\n\nMr Tata was the first Indian to receive the honorary citizenship of Singapore, which was instituted in 2003 to recognise foreigners who have made extensive services to the nation or who have made a significant impact in the areas of business, science and technology, information communications, among other sectors. The life-term award is the country’s highest recognition for a non-Singaporean.\n\nSingapore’s then President S R Nathan presented the award to Mr Tata at a solemn ceremony at the Istana. It was attended by ministers, prominent citizens and top executives of Tata Sons.\n\nAt the ceremony, then Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng described Mr Tata as an “exemplary business leader” who helped propel Singapore’s economy by making extensive contributions to its development. “The award is a reflection of Singapore’s gratitude,” Mr Wong said.\n\nMr Tata was instrumental in expanding and diversifying Tata’s operations in Singapore from steel manufacturing to information technology, from precision engineering to auto components, and other areas. Over the years, his business acumen helped Singapore tap higher value-added growth sectors.\n\nAs a young man in the 1960s, he worked at one of the Tata companies in Singapore, long before he returned to India to rise up the corporate ladder at Tata Sons.\n\nIn the decades following, he retained his links with the Republic, strengthening business ties in the information technology, auto components and precision engineering sectors.\n\nIn March 2014, Mr Tata was conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Business by the Singapore Management University (SMU) for his achievements as a visionary entrepreneur and a societal leader. It was presented to him by Singapore’s then Minister for Education Heng Sweet Keat and SMU president Arnoud De Meyer.\n\nThe ceremony, which was followed by a dialogue session with Mr Tata, was attended by about 100 guests, including India’s then High Commissioner to Singapore Vijay Thakur Singh.\n\nThe citation for the degree said: “Tata is an eminent individual who has exhibited true distinction in business and philanthropy and who has strong and active connections with SMU both directly and through his organisations.”\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Mr Tata said: “I am pleased to receive this award. I am happy to deepen my relationship with Singapore, and for this opportunity to be able to further engage, nurture and inspire bright university students in Asia to be responsible business leaders who will lead the way in global development in future.”\n\nSeveral hundred Singaporean university students have benefited from internship opportunities in the Tata Group’s companies through the SMU-Tata relationship.\n\nMr Tata received a host of honours over the years, including being listed among the 25 most powerful people in business by Fortune magazine in November 2007 and figuring in Time magazine’s 2008 “List of the World’s 100 Most Influential People”.\n\nAs Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out in his condolence message on X, “Mr Tata was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.”\n\nA licensed pilot who would occasionally fly the company plane, Mr Tata never married and was known for his quiet demeanour, relatively modest lifestyle and philanthropic work.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of people, including corporate leaders, politicians and celebrities, paid  their last respects to Mr Tata, underlining his popularity that transcended boundaries and generations. “India and the world have lost a giant with a giant heart,” United States Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said.\n\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai said: “He was instrumental in mentoring and developing the modern business leadership in India. He deeply cared about making India better.”\n\nDraped in the Indian national flag, Mr Tata’s body was kept at a cultural centre in Mumbai, and his funeral was scheduled for later in the day with full state honours.\n\nPeople paying their respects to the former chairman of Tata Group Ratan Tata, in Mumbai.

That is an area its government is keen to tap as it sought investments from Singapore government agencies and businesses this week.\n\n“Renewable energy is something that comes naturally to Rajasthan,” explained the state’s Industry and Commerce Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore at the Rising Rajasthan roadshow at the Shangri-la Hotel on Tuesday. “We are already producing about 20 gigawatts. Our target is an ambitious 100 gigawatts in the next four years.\n\n“The response has been good. The way things are going, the way people are approaching us, I think that target of four years is going to be achieved in the next two years.”\n\nMr Rathore, a silver medallist in shooting at the 2004 Athens Olympics, pointed out that Rajasthan is seeking investments in different sectors.\n\n“We have opportunities in logistics and infrastructure, and want to build an entire high-tech city next to Delhi,” he said. “The drive from Delhi to Jaipur (Rajasthan’s capital) is about two and a half hours, and the agricultural land on both sides of the expressway – that’s where we intend to build the city.”\n\n“We are appealing to all, whatever they specialise in, to participate in the development of Rajasthan.”\n\nMr Rathore, who was accompanied by Rajasthan’s chief secretary and principal secretary (medical and health), is hoping to leverage on Singapore’s expertise in urban and inland port development and the setting up of a mega petrochemical plant – the state ranks second in India for crude oil and natural gas production.\n\nDuring his four-day visit here, the Rajasthan minister also met Singapore’s Manpower Minister and Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng and Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam.\n\nThe Rajasthan delegation sought the cooperation of the Singapore government in facilitating investment in the state and discussed areas of collaboration in sectors such as solar energy, tourism and the setting up of industrial parks.\n\nMr Rathore also invited the Singapore government to participate in the Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit 2024, which will be held in Jaipur from Dec 9 to11.\n\nAfter meetings with officials at Enterprise Singapore as well as Singapore firms such as DP Urban, EnvironSens and Blackstone, Mr Rathore was bullish about the investments and expertise that will flow in.\n\nSingapore company Genesis Ray, which is focused on renewable energy and uses precision tools to produce transformative operational results, has already offered its expertise to the Rajasthan government.\n\n“We can collect data from land points in the state which will reveal their energy potential,” said Mr Nitin Jain, co-founder of Grow Asia, the parent company of Genesis. “This will help companies from south-east Asia and others compare how Rajasthan stacks up against other investment locations.”\n\nUTI International (Singapore) chief operating officer Manish Khandelwal, who hails from Jaipur, said Rajasthan is a favourable place for foreign investments as it has excellent law and order and talent and infrastructure development compared to other Indian states. “Rajasthan is way ahead in banking and ease of doing business,” he said. “The governance is also top class.”\n\nMr Rathore is taking inspiration from Singapore, which he said is “an example of the many successes that a country can achieve”. “We have a mission and a vision of taking our economy from US$150 billion to over US$400 billion in the next four years,” he said. “Rajasthan has the land, the sunshine, a young population and a bureaucracy committed to supporting businesses. It also has the political will to make things happen.”\n\n“We have a mission and a vision of taking our economy from US$150 billion to over US$400 billion.”\n\nRajasthan’s Industry and Commerce Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore (left)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c479cb4414fb5c1544a8426b91984cd528273842880792d846c983456ac956b9?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

There was even a vendor for air conditioners.\n\nAside from the rows of stalls selling biryani, jalebis and pani puri, at the back of the hall was a stage that held fashion shows, yoga classes, Bollywood dance workshops and craft events.\n\nIn 2013, when Namaste Bharat – then named Singapore International Indian Shopping Festival – was inaugurated, Bollywood heartthrob Hrithik Roshan was the event’s main attraction. This time around it was actress and event ambassador Bhagyashree.\n\n“Namate Bharat has definitely evolved over the years,” said Ms Purnima Kamath, founder and CEO of event management company De Ideaz.\n\n“The number of exhibitors and visitors has been growing over the years, and we had a very nice response to this year’s event. Over 15 communities (Maharashtra Mandal, the Bengali Association, Malayali Association to name a few) came together under one umbrella as one unified community.”\n\nMs Purnima says plans are afoot for Namaste Bharat to head overseas, to Dubai, Riyadh and perhaps even Melbourne or Sydney.\n\n“We want to become an iconic event, where every year at a fixed venue and on a fixed date, people will recognise that Namaste Bharat is happening. Hopefully, by 2026, we’ll evolved into an occasion everyone knows about.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/71b4b2ef6b5b22129f063bd272b7f32e59e7ff67bd311ec3a1a4ab023f38311b?w=825", "alt_text": "The fashion show at Namaste Bharat."}]}

As a Bengali, how could I not love Ma Durga?\n\nDurga Puja is the biggest Bengali festival, celebrated as public holidays in Kolkata and the rest of West Bengal during the month of October.\n\nI haven’t missed the festivity in all my years living and working in Singapore, offering “pushpanjali” whenever the occasion comes around. I would simply head to the Ramakrishna Mission on Bartley Road to offer my prayers. Here, it\n\nDurga Puja at the Mission is a moving experience, marked by spiritual fervour, uplifting hymns and the veneration inspired by the swamis. After prayers in front of a revered glass-framed picture of Ma Durga, my wife and I would yearn to see sculpted images of the goddess – for that is how Durga Puja is typically celebrated, by worshipping clay images of the deity.\n\nFortunately, these can be found in Singapore. Pujas are being held this year at Farrer Park, Arya Samaj opposite Mustafa Centre in Little India, the Singapore Sindhi Association in Mountbatten Road, Chinese Garden, Pasir Ris and Jurong East, according to Facebook posts.\n\nIt’s such a change from the early 1990s when I was new to Singapore. My early memories include Bengalis celebrating Durga Puja at the Indian Association in Balestier, where housewives cooked food for devotees.\n\nI remember watching the puja organised by the Bengali Association Singapore, held in an elaborate pandal near Farrer Park Hospital. Members of the association would enter the pandal for worship, while others could watch from a cordoned-off area.\n\nPujas organised by Bangladeshis here allow everyone to enter the pandals, offer prayers and eat “bhog” (a vegetarian meal offered to the gods).\n\nMr Uttom Kumar Nag, president of Bengali Community (Singapore), says one reason they started their own pujas was to avoid any discrimination. They have spent about $70,000 on Durga Puja at Chinese Gardens, importing the image of the goddess from Kolkata.\n\nMr Chandranath Bhattacharya, a sitarist, officiates as a priest at the Durga Puja organised by the Bangla Universal Society, which moved from Beatty Road to Upper Dickson Road this year. He has been performing puja in Singapore since 2011.\n\nThe puja timings differ every year, depending on the almanac, requiring priests and devotees to go without food till they have completed their prayers. Sometimes that means fasting till night, but Mr Bhattacharya is happy to fast, worship the goddess and recite the prayers that others chant with him.\n\nMy wife and I were in Kolkata during Durga Puja in 2022 and were dazzled by the spectacle. The city at night was like a mini Las Vegas – the lights, the artistry and ingenuity of the decorations, and the pandals built to resemble famous landmarks or episodes from mythology. Fantasy transformed dusty, congested Kolkata into a lavish theme park.\n\nThe festival ended with a street parade as the idols were ferried in beautifully decorated floats, accompanied by dancers, for immersion in the Ganges River. The idols were slid overboard from boats and sank without a trace. It was a gorgeous finale to Durga Puja in Kolkata, a joyous and colourful festival that has a place on Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage India List.\n\nI have seen the idols transformed by the potters’ magic. They begin life as bamboo skeletons, which are then “fleshed out” with clay. Thus, they are left to dry in the sun as headless torsos in potters’ colonies in Kolkata. The faces are moulded separately.\n\nA significant moment is reached when the potters paint Durga’s eyes. This is when the idol is said to “come to life”. The eyes are drawn to mesmerise. Anyone looking at the goddess will pause at her large, soulful eyes.\n\nThe image of the deity during Durga Puja is fascinating: She is standing astride a lion, driving a spear into the heart of a demon partly disguised as a bullock, yet her face looks so serene.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a3f9a4a6e121985577799366c26fd5890634f3b25f17ac799de2d3f527d591f4?w=825", "alt_text": "Devotees decorating an idol of the Hindu Goddess Durga with traditional weapons as part of the Durga Puja festival in Kolkata on Oct 5, 2024."}]}

It was won by Smart Star, with South Africa’s Muzi Yeni in the saddle.\n\nAmong the 16 contenders was a gelding named Don’t Forget Boss. It won no honours but did serve as an apt reminder to racegoers not to forget the thousands of thoroughbreds that have raced over the years.\n\nAll the free admission tickets to Grandstand Level 1 at the Turf Club were snapped up online, and a limited number of free Grandstand Level 1 tickets were available for on-site redemption on Sept 21 and 28 and Oct 5.\n\nThe $500 million Kranji racecourse was officially opened in 2000 by then-President SR Nathan before a crowd of about 28,000.\n\nThen, it featured the latest in-turf innovation and technology. Night racing was also made possible by 41 towering light masts installed around the course.\n\nIt had air-conditioned stables, swimming pools for the horses and Singapore’s only equine veterinary hospital.\n\nOver the years, it has hosted dignitaries including the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHowever, horse racing grew less popular among younger generations and declining race-day attendances was cited as one of the reasons to end racing here.\n\nFrom about 11,000 racegoers in 2010, it went down to 6,000 by 2019. When the racecourse reopened to the public after the Covid-19 pandemic in April 2022, the average attendance per race day was a measly 2,600.\n\nThere is also the need for more houses. By March 2027, the 124ha piece of land – an area spanning more than 300 football fields – occupied by the Kranji facility will be returned to the Government to allow for housing and other developments.\n\nHorse exportation has already begun and will be completed by March 2026, along with preparations for the estate to be handed over. There are currently 240 race horses at the club, down from the initial population of 700.\n\nHowever, the 10,000-strong crowd at the races on Saturday had other things on their minds.\n\nMany explored the premises and captured memories as they snapped photos around the venue. There were even visitors in wheelchairs, who kept their caregivers busy by placing bets.\n\nAt the VIP stands, champagne flowed freely as men in suits and women in gowns and stylish hats helped themselves to a fine buffet spread.\n\nNot all were veteran racegoers. A woman, probably seeing a horse in the flesh for the first time, was overheard saying: “Wah! Never knew a horse could be so big.”\n\nGraphics artist Simon Tan, 28, who was there with his girlfriend, told tabla!: “We wanted to check out what the fuss was all about. Have to admit, it is quite captivating.”\n\nEven after the closure of STC, memories of horse racing will surely live on.\n\nAs author Lucy Maud Montgomery once wrote: “Nothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it.”\n\nSo, don’t forget, boss.\n\nKhush Randhawa\n\nPeople watching Race 10: Grand Singapore Gold Cup at Kranji Racecourse on Oct 5, 2024.\n\nPhoto: The Straits Times\n\nJockeys race horses parade before a race at the Singapore Turf Club (STC), in Singapore, 05 October 2024.\n\nPhoto: EPA-EFE\n\nViewing of horses in Parade Ring at Singapore Turf Club on Oct 5, 2024.\n\nPhoto: The Straits Times\n\nHorse racing grew less popular among younger generations and declining race-day attendances was cited as one of the reasons to end racing here.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5bbd8d0a038abc8a6970c2c2fc673cf7cd75294e1dca6f062e9e6e3cbe9866df?w=825", "alt_text": "Spectators at the Singapore Turf Club in Kranji during the final race day on Oct 5."}]}

I am a big believer in the circle of life,” the former world No. 1 in doubles told PTI.\n\n“I think we all need to have a little bit of patience as far as tennis goes. We have all enjoyed such an upswing over the last 40 years, proving that we can be number one in both women’s doubles and men’s doubles.”\n\nCurrently, Sumit Nagal is the only Indian in the top 100 of the ATP men’s singles rankings, positioned at 83, while Ramkumar Ramanathan follows at 332.\n\nAt 44 years, Rohan Bopanna remains the flag-bearer of men’s doubles in India, currently ranked sixth, with another veteran, Yuki Bhambri, at 43rd.\n\nThe WTA rankings reveal a grim situation for Indian women’s tennis, with no player in the top 200; Sahaja Yamalapalli is the highest-ranked Indian at 293.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, Sania Mirza was ranked by the Women’s Tennis Association as the No. 1 Indian in singles, reaching a career high of No. 27 in the WTA rankings in 2007.\n\nThroughout her career, Mirza won three Grand Slam titles in doubles. She retired in 2023.\n\nPaes, 51, further highlighted the significant growth of tennis in India over the past four decades, noting its rise to become the second most popular sport after cricket.\n\n“Over the four decades that I played, tennis grew in popularity so much that it became the number two sport in the country after cricket,” Paes, the winner of 18 Grand Slam titles, said.\n\n“Between Sania, Mahesh (Bhupathi), Bopanna and me, we have collectively won close to 40 Grand Slam titles, along with Olympic medals and several Asian Games medals.

Screwvala’s father, who worked in the film distribution industry, gave him a love of media and entertainment at a young age. Growing up with limited resources, Screwvala was raised to value perseverance and hard work.\n\nStarting out as a businessman, he entered the TV industry during the cable TV boom in India in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1990, he used a capital of Rs37,000 to set up UTV. Initially a TV production house, it became a major movie producer.\n\nUTV produced popular TV shows such as Shanti and Sea Hawks, before moving to film production with titles like Swades, Jodhaa Akbar, Fashion, Barfi and Chennai Express.\n\nIn 2012, Screwvala sold his share of the company to Disney for a billion dollars, in one of the biggest deals in Indian cinema history.\n\nHe eventually founded RSVP Movies, a production house behind films such as Uri and Kedarnath, among others.\n\nIn recent times, it has produced films such as Sam Bahadur, Love Sitara, The Immortal Ashwatthama and Captain India.\n\nScrewvala’s entrepreneurial journey did not stop even after his films made massive money. He is also the co-founder of India’s largest online education company upGrad.\n\nUnder Screwvala’s leadership, upGrad adopted an innovative approach to online education, offering industry-relevant courses in collaboration with top universities and industry experts.\n\nThe platform’s focus on personalised learning, mentorship and hands-on projects has set it apart in India’s competitive edtech landscape.\n\n“Generally, the difference between success and failure is about staying the course,” Screwvala has said.\n\n“Dreaming with your eyes open means being alert to challenges but refusing to let them stop you.

However, only 27 trams are operating on 12km of track, down from 100 trams on 61km in 2011,” he said.\n\nThe official explained that the reduction in tram numbers is due to a lack of spare parts for repairs. “Trams have become a white elephant, but we are not looking to withdraw them completely. We are considering rationalising services based on the current situation,” he added.\n\nIn 2011, around 70,000 people used trams daily, but today that number has dropped to about 7,000. Due to this, the state stopped investing in trams in 2018, except for heritage vehicles used for tourism.\n\n“We have no intention to remove the trams meant for heritage purposes,” the official said.\n\nTrams were first introduced in Kolkata in 1873 as horse-drawn carriages. Over time, they were modernised with steam engines and later electric power in 1900. For decades, trams were a crucial part of the city’s transportation and a symbol of its heritage. They have appeared in Indian cinema since the 1950s and were once so central to life in Kolkata that a small fare hike in 1953 sparked protests.\n\nThe recent announcement has sparked similar responses from tram supporters in Kolkata, who view the government’s plan to reduce tram services as an attempt to erase a key part of the city’s history.\n\nThe Calcutta Tram Users Association (CTUA) held protests at Shyambazar and is planning more demonstrations at other tram depots.\n\n“We will not allow this to happen.

It took about “five to six years” before he received a call from the bone marrow donor programme, informing him that he could potentially save a life.\n\n“I was astonished to be presented with such a blessed opportunity,” Dr Devan said. “The situation became increasingly intricate as I am a diabetic, a condition I discovered only after my registration in the database.\n\n“I understood that even if I were the most suitable match, there were elements that could affect my selection as a donor. So I felt a sense of relief when I was chosen to donate.”\n\nHe told tabla! that his wife’s family had suffered losses to hematological malignancies (cancers arising from abnormal blood or bone marrow cells) in the past, and their struggle to find suitable donors in India fuelled his determination to inspire change.\n\nWith the backing of his wife and two young daughters, along with discussions with his medical peers, Dr Devan moved forward with the peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donation, performed through a non-invasive procedure known as apheresis.\n\nThe process involves drawing blood from one arm via an intravenous tube, which then flows into an apheresis machine designed to separate the stem cells from the blood. The stem cells are collected for storage, while the remaining blood is returned through an intravenous tube in the other arm.\n\nThe procedure went smoothly and the recovery process took\n\napproximately two weeks\n\n,\n\nduring which he periodically monitored his blood sugar levels before resuming work and his daily exercise routine.\n\n“What if someone in our extended family needs assistance tomorrow? Often, we believe it won’t happen to us until it does,” Dr Devan said. “It’s vital for more people within our community to step up and contribute. Be the change you wish to inspire in others.”\n\nHe added: “If I were to donate my organs after my passing, I won’t know who will benefit from it. With a bone marrow donation, I can witness the impact within a few years and perhaps even meet the recipient. That would be an extraordinary experience.”\n\nOn Sept 21, in conjunction with World Marrow Donor Day, the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (BMDP) hosted an event where 10 bone marrow recipients met their life-saving donors.\n\nAccording to BMDP’s guidelines, donors and recipients remain anonymous to each other for two years. And if both parties are interested to meet, BMDP helps to facilitate this.\n\nAs highlighted in BMDP’s 2023 report, there is a salient underrepresentation of Malays and Indians within its registry – Malays account for 8 per cent and Indians 9 per cent. This makes it challenging for patients from various ethnic backgrounds seeking a match, according to the report.\n\nWhen discussing the challenges related to the underrepresentation of Indians in the registry, the BMDP cited a lack of public awareness on the topic that leads to stigmas surrounding bone marrow donation.\n\n“Most people have the impression that bone marrow is taken from the spine; others think they are giving a part of their bone away,” said chief executive of BMDP Charles Loh.\n\n“There are also cases of registered donors who face objections from family and loved ones. Family objections constitute one of the top reasons for donor drop-outs. So, we encourage family and friends to be more supportive and learn about bone marrow donation as well. You are not just saving a life. You are helping a whole family.”\n\nIn line with the underrepresentation of Indians, the BMDP collaborated with the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) on Project Give last year, where a recruitment booth was set up at the Indian Heritage Centre.\n\n“At our annual flagship event, Match For Life, at Our Tampines Hub on Nov 9, SINDA is participating as a partner by setting up a booth at our carnival,” said Mr Loh.\n\n“With heightened support and awareness, we hope to reduce the drop-out rate and save more lives.”\n\n“What if someone in our extended family needs assistance tomorrow?

Shamini.\n\nAli Kasim\n\nSommelier K. Shamini has been asked the question enough times that she has perfected her answer.\n\n“A wine Sherpa that guides you along your journey towards discovering wine,” she says when I ask her what a sommelier means and does.\n\nThe 36-year-old Singaporean, who works as the head sommelier at Wine To Share, a South African winemaker and distributor, is one of a handful of female sommeliers in Singapore. More significantly, she is one of the rare few of Indian descent.\n\nEmphasising that a person’s “wine and dine” experience is ultimately “all about the food”, Shamini says there is often a lot of communication between the kitchen and the sommelier about what type of wine pairs well with the cuisine on offer.\n\nHer food and beverage career began as a hostess at Wolfgang Puck’s CUT restaurant at Marina Bay Sands, where she found herself intrigued by how her colleagues knew so much about wine and would know just which type to pair with a certain dish.\n\n“My colleague had information about each wine at her fingertips. Whenever she talked about her work, my interest in it doubled each day,” Shamini says. “Everytime she went to the table she would sell, and it left an impression on me.”\n\nBut it wasn’t until she worked at Esquina in Chinatown that she fell in love with wine. “There I learnt about Albarino (a variety of grape for white wine), which is one of my favourite grapes. It’s so underrated. Later, I gained an appreciation for Rioja wines and grenache.”\n\nSold on the mysteries and intricacies of wine, Shamini obtained her sommelier certification after completing four levels at Wine & Spirit Education Trust, a global organisation that arranges courses and exams in the fields of wine, spirits, beer and sake.\n\n“I completed four levels – you only need three to become a certified sommelier – and I learnt basically what wine is, how grapes work, the different types of wine and the vinification process,” she explains.\n\n“I just liked learning about it, and then having the answers to diners when they ask me about different types of wine.”\n\nHer educational journey also took her to London and France, where she saw first-hand the lives of farmers working in the vineyard and observed how wine is made from scratch.\n\nLater on, Shamini had sommelier stints at several fine dining establishments in Singapore, including Les Amis, which is renowned for having the largest wine collection in South-east Asia.\n\nShe also had spells at Indian restaurants Revolver and Amakase.\n\nWine and Indian food? Surely they don’t go well together, I ask.\n\n“Many people are apprehensive about the combination. But it’s just about playing with the spices,” Shamini says confidently.\n\n“Indian, Thai and Chinese – these cuisines are similar in terms of spice levels. So white varietals like Viognier work well. For the reds, the heavier stuff works best, like a young Bordeaux – because they have the acidity that cuts through the fat and the oil.”\n\n“If you’re having a biryani, do a Syrah or a Shiraz,” she adds. “A zinfandel as well. All these have weight, so they work well with Indian food.”\n\nFor those who want to develop a predilection for wine, but are often put off by various reasons – cost, not knowing which wine to choose – Shamini says simply: “Just start drinking.”\n\n“And every time you drink a glass of wine, pick out one characteristic that you like or are familiar with.\n\n“You don’t have to be overwhelmed by someone who says ‘this wine tastes of nutmeg or the water at Niagara Falls’, because that’s someone else’s taste buds and palette. There are a lot of things you yourself can identify with. There’s no right or wrong.\n\n“The more you taste, the more you understand. And you’ll find your palate is actually much smarter than what you think.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6cbdc3a015395ff5353bb6ec21fc78897af3df63ecb9c6b35acac83427f28d0e?w=825", "alt_text": "Sommelier K.

Iswaran.\n\nREUTERS\n\nகி. ஜனார்த்தனன்\n\nஎஸ் வெங்கடேஷ்வரன்\n\nThe sombre mood at the Supreme Court on Thursday was met with gasps as Judge Vincent Hoong read out the sentence for former transport minister S. Iswaran.\n\nThe 62-year-old was handed a 12-month jail term in a landmark case that saw, for the first time, a former cabinet minister being sentenced. Rather significantly, the punishment was more than the six to seven months’ jail the prosecution had sought.\n\nIswaran cut a stoic figure as he arrived in court at 9.20am, his eyes closed on more than one occasion as he waited some 40 minutes for proceedings to begin.\n\nAs Justice Hoong read out his sentencing remarks, the former minister – who pleaded guilty on Sept 24 to four charges of obtaining valuable items as a public servant, and a fifth charge of obstructing the course of justice – took handwritten notes.\n\nAddressing the court, Justice Hoong said he was unable to agree with the positions of both the prosecution and the defence. The defence had sought not more than eight weeks’ jail.\n\nThe judge said he was of the view that it was appropriate to impose a heavier sentence than what both parties had asked for, which were manifestly inadequate – this drew the first round of gasps heard in the courtroom.\n\nThe sentence was meted out in front of more than 40 people in the gallery, which included Iswaran’s family, some of whom sighed audibly as the sentence was read out.\n\nIswaran himself exhaled in despair as he glanced into the void.\n\nIn his sentencing remarks, Justice Hoong emphasised that trust and confidence in public institutions are the bedrock of effective governance. “This can all too easily be undermined by a public servant who falls below standards of integrity and accountability,” he said.\n\nThe judge added that it was significant that Iswaran had made public statements rejecting the charges as false.\n\n“In a letter to the Prime Minister, Iswaran said he rejected the charges and was innocent, and believed he would be acquitted. Thus, I have difficulty believing that he was remorseful,” he said.\n\nThe judge added: “Holders of high office ordinarily wield a greater degree of potential influence over significant business transactions or proceedings and have a larger resultant impact on the public interest.”\n\nAside from the five charges Iswaran pleaded guilty to, another 30 were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nAs a minister and chairman of the Formula One steering committee, Iswaran was tasked to oversee high-level decisions and collaboration between government agencies and the Singapore Grand Prix as a national project.\n\nIn the course of his role, he admitted to obtaining valuable items worth more than $400,000 in total from businessman Ong Beng Seng and Mr David Lum Kok Seng, managing director of mainboard-listed construction company Lum Chang Holdings.\n\nHe has paid back more than $380,000 to the state and will forfeit the items he received.\n\nOn Thursday, Iswaran exited the High Court at around 11.35am, almost an hour after the 40-minute court session. He told the media he had no comments at this point and walked to a waiting car.\n\nIswaran is to surrender himself at 4pm on Oct 7 at the State Courts. An appeal against his sentence must be done within 14 days.\n\nPhoto: Sundara Nataraaj", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0a58caa2ad3f7e3badf605f4d1f525f50e3d293db90684757687598d2d8848c1?w=825", "alt_text": "Former transport minister S.

Most of its young people have now moved to cities or abroad, with many families migrating to the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nMr Poonambhai, who spent 20 years in New York, found the villagers were lonely when he returned. He then set upon the task of restoring the community spirit.\n\n“We started the kitchen because the elderly citizens make food only once a day,” he said. “They eat the same food in the evening and sometimes even the next morning. It is not good for their health.\n\n“Now our Chandanki is a village that lives for each other.”\n\nOver the years, the kitchen has improved residents’ health and social connections, reported the Times of India.\n\nThe kitchen offers a variety of traditional Gujarati dishes, ensuring both nutritional balance and variety.\n\nFor a nominal fee, villagers gain access to two meals a day, lovingly prepared by hired cooks. From hearty dal and fragrant vegetables to crispy rotis, the menu boasts a delightful array of traditional Gujarati dishes, ensuring both sustenance and satisfaction.\n\nMeals are served in a solar-powered air-conditioned hall, where people gather to share their joys and sorrows – creating a strong bond.\n\nMr Ramesh Patel, 73, who moved from Ahmedabad to Chandanki after retirement, said: “My son Jigar lives in Australia and we have many elders like me in the village.\n\n“To beat loneliness, we have our meals together. Soon, we will have a park too.”\n\nThe idea of a community kitchen was initially met with skepticism. But, as the benefits became evident, more villagers embraced it. The kitchen has given the elderly more time to rest and engage in other activities.\n\nIn Chandanki, food isn’t just sustenance; it’s a thread that weaves together the fabric of community spirit and shared values. This isn’t just about eating; it’s a daily celebration of togetherness.\n\n“To beat loneliness, we have our meals together.

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/world/india-third-superpower", "site_title": "India the third superpower", "publish_date": null, "content": "News\n\nIndia the third superpower\n\nUPDATED\n\nOct 3, 2024, 7:15 PM\n\nAsad Latif\n\nFormer British prime minister Tony Blair said in Singapore recently that he thinks the world will effectively have three superpowers by 2050: the United States, China and “probably” India.\n\nMr Blair made the assessment in an interview with The Straits Times on Sept 23, while he was in Singapore for the annual Asia Summit of American think-tank Milken Institute.\n\nThe provisional nature of the superpower status that Mr Blair attributes to India suggests that while the US and China have made it, so to speak, India still has to. Since his time frame is only two-and-a-half decades away, a wink in the eye of world history, India has some catching-up to do, and soon.\n\nIs that possible?  It is.\n\nAmerican diplomatic history traces the emergence of the US as a superpower to 1898, when its support for the successful independence of Cuba would bring “America into far closer and more complex relations with all the other great Powers of the world”, in the words of a contemporary observer.\n\nUpon imperial Britain’s retreat from the global stage at the end of World War II in 1945 and the onset of decolonisation, its great-power mantle passed to the US. Hence, the US took just less than five decades (1898-1945) to become a superpower.\n\nThe US was resisted vehemently by the other superpower, the Soviet Union. When the Cold War between them ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the US emerged as the sole superpower.\n\nBy then, China was well on its way to emulating the American ascendancy to superpower status. It had effectively discarded communism as the motivating force of its economic policies in 1978, when it was in a de facto alliance with the US against the Soviet Union.\n\nChina wanted to both leave the Soviet Union behind and overtake America as a superpower one day. That hasn’t come to pass, but China is a superpower by virtue of its geography, population, large and inventive manufacturing and technological base, globalised economic policies, growing military prowess and an intensely historical self-awareness as a nation destined to guide the world – all American attributes as well.\n\nChina was a superpower in all but name by 2008, when the Global Financial Crisis all but destroyed the economic basis of American hegemony. In three decades (1978-2008), it had emulated the five decades it had taken America to establish its supremacy in world affairs.\n\nSince 2008, China has cemented its economic ascendancy by embarking on an expansive military policy in the South China Sea that leaves no one in any doubt of its intention to counter America’s position as the default power in the Indo-Pacific region. The US  seeks to counter China’s rise through a containment policy once directed at the Soviet Union, but most Asian countries are less interested in containing China than in balancing it.\n\nThis is where India comes in. Its economic reforms, initiated in 1991, have unleashed the potential of 1.4 billion people (just ahead of China’s population) who are hungry for change and are willing to work hard for prosperity.\n\nAccording to figures just reported in Forbes, India’s gross domestic product ($5.09 trillion) trails woefully behind that of the US ($37.08 trillion) and China ($23.88 trillion). Germany and Japan come between America, China and India in the top five GDPs.\n\nHowever, India is a nuclear power like the US and China – unlike Germany and Japan, who are unable to translate their economic prowess into equivalent military might.\n\nAlso, like the US and China, India possesses immense historical self-confidence. It is a country that has emerged from centuries of invasion, subjugation and colonial dependence to establish its autonomous agency in world affairs. Like both the US and China, it displays a capacity for spontaneous order: an instinctive return to stability that overrides insurrectionary moments (such as the Tiananmen uprising in China, the Capitol Hill riots in the US and the Maoist movement in India).\n\nIn a word, India is a civilisational state along with the US and China. Such states represent the value of world-ringing ideas in the lives of nations. They are not destroyed easily.\n\nIf Mr Blair is right, the world in 2050 will be far more sustainable politically than it is now.\n\nFor the young everywhere, who will be very much around then, those will be good times to live in.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/world/india-third-superpower?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nCan I Make you A Suit, Mate? is the story of a Sindhi man, whose family fled from riots and violence, saw the partition of British India into India and Pakistan and were forced out of their homes to build a life in Singapore.\n\nIt is, in a way, every immigrants story, told through the lens of a friendly tailor, trying to sell you a suit.\n\nStand-up comedian Rishi Budhrani, who will present the show at The Ngee Ann Kongsi Theatre @ Wild Rice from Oct 23 to 27, said such a story – and format – has never been previously attempted in Singapore.\n\nThe narrative is loosely based on his father Prakash Budhrani, a tailor better known as Jimmy to his clients, who moved to Singapore in the 1960s.\n\nWith the help of photos to transport the audience to that time period, it narrates a story of hardship and hard work.\n\n“I reckon this is one of the subject matters which is both timely and timeless,” Rishi told tabla!. “And that’s why, even two years after its first staging, it is still a relevant and exciting topic for me to tackle and for the audience to enjoy.”\n\nThe first run of this show was at The Esplanade’s Kalaa Utsavam Indian Festival of the Arts in 2022. It played over two shows to a small audience.\n\n“And it sold out very fast, so a lot of people missed it,” said Rishi. “It received a lot of positive feedback and requests for re-runs from the audience. I believe in creative democracy, so I’m giving the people what they want.”\n\nCan I Make you A Suit, Mate? is a departure from Rishi’s regular stand-up comedy shows as it combines elements of theatre, storytelling and improvisation with the audience, in addition to the jokes. The format remains the same from the first run – some minor tweaks notwithstanding – but it will be staged in a bigger theatre.\n\n“I’ve really enjoyed the process, and want to share it with a wider audience,” said Rishi, who was the first stand-up comedian invited to host the National Day Parade in 2022.\n\nAccording to The Straits Times, which reviewed the show at The Esplanade, the comic appeared unafraid to poke fun at himself through the eyes of his father. Rishi made quips about his career choice and how he uses anecdotes about Jimmy as material for his stand-up routines.\n\nIn between stories of Jimmy settling down in Singapore and becoming a tailor, a deeper narrative unfolded – of Rishi’s immense admiration for him. Though the show is rife with humour and sarcastic remarks, it is ultimately a way for Rishi to honour his father.\n\nHe jokes about Jimmy living in a tiny room with his family and several cockroaches, but it is mixed with pride for how his father rose from his humble beginnings.\n\nRishi, the voice of Sammy in the award-winning Netflix animated series Downstairs, said he didn’t follow in his father’s footsteps because “he did not want me to”.\n\n“He kept me away from the retail trade and wanted me to study and become a professional – a lawyer, doctor, engineer. Look what happened – I became a professional comedian,” he said.\n\nCan I Make You A Suit, Mate? actually conveys the message that there is no one-size fits all when it comes to building a life and pursuing your dreams.\n\n“We all have the ability to tailor-make our lives and keep making adjustments along the way,” Rishi said. “So, custom-make your own suit of life and wear it proudly. Only you know how wonderfully it fits you.”\n\n“He kept me away from the retail trade and wanted me to study and become a professional – a lawyer, doctor, engineer.

Santosh Kumar\n\nWorld chess champion Ding Liren knows that his performances over the past year haven’t been up to his usual high standards.\n\nBut he is confident he will be back to his best when he takes on India’s Gukesh Dommaraju in the world championship match in Singapore from Nov 25 to Dec 13.\n\n“I didn’t do well at the recent Olympiad,” he said in Mandarin during an interview on Monday. “In the Wijk aan Zee (the Tata Steel tournament held in January in the Netherlands) too I didn’t perform up to my expectations. But, at the end of the day, a match is a match; it’s between two players. When a player starts to hit his stride, how the opponent reacts depends on his experience.”\n\nAt the Olympiad, held in Budapest, Hungary, from Sept 10 to 23, Gukesh, 18, was in brilliant form, winning nine of his 10 matches. Ding, 31, drew seven matches and lost one. He also opted out of playing against India.\n\nGukesh was instrumental in his team winning the title, while Ding’s poor display cost China a podium place.\n\nDing is the highest-rated Chinese chess player in history. But, from the beginning of this year, he has been under heavy scrutiny from the chess world for his low activity level and poor results since winning the world title in April 2023.\n\nNorwegian Grand Master Magnus Carlsen even told Chess.com that Ding “is sort of permanently broken”  and is unsure whether the former world No. 2 will actually be able to return to his peak.\n\nDing took eight months off from chess after his eighth place in the Superbet Chess Classic just after becoming world champion by beating Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi. He later revealed to Chess.com that he was suffering from undisclosed health issues. He also admitted to struggling with motivation and hinted at retirement.\n\n“It doesn’t seem like I’ve been playing the way I used to, and I don’t know if I will ever reach that level again,” Ding admitted on Monday, adding that he has consulted a psychologist about his mental issues.\n\n“I feel normal... the doctor has given some advice. I have been playing basketball after dinner, trying not to give myself too much stress.\n\n“I feel okay. I’m not at my lowest... I feel like I have been playing decent chess but have not been winning.”\n\nHe added that “life goes on as normal”.\n\n“I still stay at home, nothing has really changed,” he said. “I believe there will be a turning point soon. I will give my best for this World Championship.”\n\nDing said that he has been preparing for the Singapore match by playing at least one tournament every month. “The last tournament was the Olympiad, which ended not more than 10 days ago. That event is a classical time control with additional time after 40 moves. I believe that will help me to acclimatise and be ready for the match in Singapore.”\n\nBut many chess experts believe that Ding will find it difficult to defend his title at Resorts World Sentosa as Gukesh is playing brilliant chess.\n\nWhen asked about his opponent, Ding said: “My competitor is young but also very strong.\n\n“This test will be extremely difficult as Gukesh is in the form of his life and his Fide rating is getting closer to the 2,800 mark, while my rating has been on the decline and there’s quite a gap between him and I.”\n\nGukesh is ranked world No. 5 with a Fide rating of 2,794, while Ding is 21st with 2,728 points.\n\n“It doesn’t seem like I’ve been playing the way I used to, and I don’t know if I will ever reach that level again.”\n\nDing Liren (left), who said he has consulted a psychologist about his mental issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0b6892d68286dbf94a20c846a70c1375666d91082647020bfbf3572a22e9e869?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The “Khans” of Bollywood – Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir – are the holy trinity of cinema for aunties across the Indian diaspora. While they might politely debate politics or swap recipes over chai, bring up the Khans and you’ll see a side of them you never knew existed.\n\nShah Rukh squad: Lovers of romance and drama\n\nFirst, we have the Shah Rukh auntie. Usually from North India, let’s say, someone like Mrs Bhalla who hails from Delhi. Now, Mrs Bhalla has been a Shah Rukh devotee since Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge graced the silver screen in 1995. And why not? After all, Shah Rukh’s charm could melt butter faster than a Delhi heatwave.\n\nFor Mrs Bhalla, Shah Rukh, 58, isn’t just an actor – he’s a lifestyle.\n\n“He’s so sensitive,” she swoons during kitty parties, as she recounts – for the 87th time – the moment Shah Rukh stretched out his arms in the mustard fields, singing “Tujhe dekha toh.”\n\nThe other aunties roll their eyes, but deep down, they too have dreamt of dancing in Switzerland with a dimpled SRK.\n\nAs soon as Mrs Bhalla looks away, her friend Mrs Patel mumbles: “Sensitive? She means soppy. How many times can he cry in one film?”\n\nSalman sisterhood: Tough love, muscle and machismo\n\nFor those like the aforementioned Mrs Patel, who hails from Gujarat, Salman Khan isn’t just a superstar – he’s a being sent from above, draped in leather jackets and muscles. She’ll also tell you that his movies aren’t just about entertainment – they’re about values.\n\n“Salman has such a big heart,” she’ll say referring to his regular charity work.\n\n“And have you seen his action scenes? Those muscles!\n\nHer love for the 58-year-old actor is practical. “Beta,” she advises her nieces. “If you need a man, find someone like Salman. He’ll always be ready to fight for you.”\n\nOf course, she leaves out the fact that he’s often shirtless for 90 per cent of the movie, but that’s beside the point. “Salman is about protection and strength.”\n\nAnd don’t even think about mentioning the man’s litany of controversies – Mrs Patel is quick to brush those aside with: “People are jealous of his success.”\n\nAs her friend, Mrs Menon, pretends to adjust her sari, she mutters under her breath, “Charity work? She means shirtless show-offs. I doubt he could even string a sentence together.”\n\nAamir admirers: Lovers of intelligence and perfection\n\nFinally, we have the Aamir Khan Auntie, personified by Mrs Menon from Kerala.\n\nNow, Mrs Menon isn’t easily swayed by action or romance; she’s a practical woman, deeply rooted in intellect and academia. So naturally, she’s drawn to Aamir’s reputation for perfectionism and meaningful cinema.\n\nWhile her peers are swooning over SRK’s dimpled smiles or Salman’s bulging biceps, Mrs Menon will sip her filter coffee and ask: “But does he have range? Does he do films with meaning?”\n\nFor her, it’s not about a shirtless hero running in slow motion. It’s about the depth of the storyline, the emotion and the moral takeaway. “You watch an Aamir Khan film, and you leave changed,” she declares while organising her collection of DVDs that include Lagaan and Taare Zameen Par.\n\nMrs Menon loves reminding everyone that Aamir is an intellectual Khan. “He doesn’t do fluff,” she’ll say proudly.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Bhalla rolls her eyes and whispers to Mrs Patel: “She says intellectual – what she means is boring. I’d rather watch paint dry than sit through Lagaan again.”\n\nThe great debate: Which Khan is king?\n\nEntertainment (and chaos) ensue when these aunties get together. Picture it: a family function, everyone’s relaxed after a meal of biryani and jalebis. Suddenly, someone casually asks: “Did you see Shah Rukh’s latest film?”\n\nMrs Bhalla’s eyes light up like Deepavali lamps. “Of course! Did you see how he cried during that scene with the violin? I was sobbing with every note of that instrument. He’s so versatile.”\n\nMrs Patel is quick to interject. “His fight sequences were really lame.Trying to look macho by wearing a ponytail. Salman does his own fights like Tom Cruise. Shah Rukh is old with a bad back; stuntmen do his stunts for him!”\n\nMrs Menon, in a calm but firm voice, adds: “But is it cinema? Action is fine, but Aamir challenges you. He makes you question society. What are we learning from Salman’s fights or Shah Rukh’s love stories?”\n\nAnd so it goes, back and forth. No minds are changed, but it’s a spirited debate that continues well into the night.\n\nA Khan for every auntie\n\nIn the end, every Indian auntie has her favourite Khan, and nothing can sway her opinion. Whether it’s Shah Rukh’s romance, Salman’s action or Aamir’s perfectionism, each of them holds a special place in their hearts. And perhaps that’s the essence and magic of Bollywood.\n\nSo the next time you overhear a group of aunties passionately discussing their favourite stars, just sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy the show. After all, in the world of Indian cinema, there’s a Khan for everyone.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/78ed87bebfce40927afaea318302091c99a5d96e2ef54c4fbdff6bb8de2bdfd1?w=825", "alt_text": "Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBengaluru’s virtues were extolled by Karnataka Government Secretary Ekroop Caur on Tuesday at a roadshow at The Fullerton hotel, during which she invited Singapore business leaders to invest more in the Indian city and attend next month’s Bengaluru Tech Summit.\n\n“With a projected GDP of 8.5 per cent, Bengaluru will be the world’s fastest-growing city for the next 15 years,” she said, quoting the 2024 Bangalore Innovation Report. “It has the largest AI talent pool in India and a quarter of the country’s digital talent. It is the start-up capital of India and the top achiever in ease of doing business.\n\n“For a city to produce successful entrepreneurs, it needs to provide the right policy support and allied infrastructure that can nurture innovation. With the creation of the Startup Vision Group Karnataka, we have aimed to bring together the brightest minds in the ecosystem.”\n\nBengaluru is ranked 21st in the Top 30 Global Startup Ecosystems cities list, and stands fourth among Asian cities in terms of the number of high-growth companies present.\n\nAccording to the Bangalore Innovation Report, curated by venture capital company 3one4 Capital and the Startup Vision Group, the 10 cities with the highest GDP growth rates between 2020 and 2035 are projected to be based in Asia, with Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi featuring among them.\n\nMs Caur, who is secretary in the department of electronics, information technology, biotechnology and science and technology, said that since 2010, Bengaluru has seen a substantial growth of start-ups, with around 18,000 to date.\n\nShe also said Singapore has been one of the key stakeholders in the development of Bengaluru as a global tech hub over the past 30 years.\n\n“We have had a very deep association with Singapore right from the beginning of the tech revolution in Bengaluru,” said Ms Caur. “We are natural allies and we can accelerate a lot of business growth in Bengaluru via Singapore.”\n\nMajor Singapore companies such as Capitaland, DBS, Keppel, Singapore Airlines and Sembcorp Utilities already have a substantial presence in Bengaluru. Ms Caur said smaller Singapore companies could further connect with corporations around the world through Bengaluru, while also highlighting that the local talent has the capability to work globally.\n\nSingapore company DevBoost by iTechGenic Global, an engineering management platform that helps engineering leaders align their work with strategic business objectives, is about to venture into Bengaluru.\n\nIts co-founder and CEO Tushar Doshi said: “Bengaluru is the No. 1 city in so many aspects of the IT industry.  It probably has the largest concentration of software developers and teams and is one of the biggest Indian metro cities for DevOps, which is a space where DevBoost makes a very strong impact.”\n\nSingapore venture solutions company BeyondSeed, a growth engine designed to help start-up founders move from Seed to Series A by connecting them to dedicated professionals, describes Bengaluru as the ideal spot for start-ups.\n\nIts founder and CEO Kuldeep Mirani said: “Bengaluru offers not just business opportunities but also the best talent in India. The local people are well-educated and English-speaking. The city is also not expensive like Mumbai which makes it conducive for doing business.”\n\nFollowing Ms Caur’s presentation, a 23-member delegation from Singapore is set to attend the Bengaluru Tech Summit at the Bangalore Palace from Nov 19 to 21. It is expected to see more than 25,000 business attendees and 50,000 visitors.\n\n“We have had a very deep association with Singapore right from the beginning of the tech revolution in Bengaluru.

I couldn’t have been more than 15 years old.\n\nThe discussion I was having with Sanjay Tiwari, an ex-schoolmate who I had bumped into inside the dimly lit ballroom at the Equarius Hotel Sentosa began as a lighthearted one.\n\nI opined, rather facetiously, that a sport isn’t really a sport unless the athlete breaks out in some measure of sweat. “There has to be some physical exertion,” I argued. “Chess is a game.”\n\nSanjay, who was a C’ Division (Under-14) chess finalist back in the day, wasn’t having any of it: “Chess is both a game and a sport. And it is more physically demanding than you think.”\n\n“Shhhh” interrupted a volunteer usher with his finger pressed on his lips.\n\nNot that Ding Liren or Gukesh Dommaraju could hear us inside their one-way glass panel on a dais some 10m in front of us. But okay, point taken.\n\nImagine being at Anfield and being shushed for speaking too loud during a corner kick. Or at Madison Square Garden before a free throw. Here’s another reason why chess isn’t a sport, I whisper to Sanjay – the players prefer that spectators aren’t present.\n\nSpeaking of in absentia, where were the Chinese press and supporters?\n\nInside a full ballroom of 400 people, the absence of a Chinese flag or fan was salient. The majority of spectators were either local or Indian – a partisan show of support for 18-year-old Gukesh, the youngest ever challenger for the title.\n\nPerhaps if this was football or basketball, there would have been more Chinese supporters in and around Sentosa.\n\nStill, Ding, 32, is the reigning champion. Surely his brethren – from a country of 1.4 billion people no less – might have found it fitting to travel to the Lion City and provide him some in-person encouragement?\n\nAfter all, this was chess at the highest level. And featuring the two most populous countries in the world. This was Game 2. China had won Game 1 the day before.\n\nAll eyes were glued – with mouths shut – on the two grandmasters in front of them as Ding vexed over his seventh move against his challenger.\n\nSuddenly, a few sections of the crowd gasped in unison. Gukesh had made an unexpected move with his black knight. Not that it seemed to faze Ding, who stayed frozen in his seat. He had previously left his seat a few times in between moves.\n\nThough he is the world champion, Ding was regarded as the underdog coming into the best-of-14-match, given his poor form over the past few months. In fact, his Game 1 victory was his first classical win in 304 days and 28 games.\n\nToday, however, after 23 moves which lasted a tense three hours, both players settled on a draw by threefold repetition (a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game).\n\nGame 3 on Wednesday went to Gukesh to even the overall score 1.5 to 1.5. The series will continue till Dec 13, or when one player reaches 7.5 games.\n\n“Why did Ding leave his seat so many times during the match?” I asked Sanjay as everyone stood up to applaud the two players as they exited the stage in opposite directions.\n\n“To go to his private lounge,” Sanjay explained. “Players are allowed to do so while waiting for their opponent’s move.”\n\n“Ok,\n\nnow\n\nit’s definitely not a sport,” I reply.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/58b635bc7ba912d67ba54203d739eefcfeaf7e6909ff9bbf77384f879c2d5261?w=825", "alt_text": "Photographers and spectators behind a one-way glass window while Gukesh Dommaraju and Ding Liren contest for the FIDE World Chess Championship at Resorts World Sentosa."}]}

At the time, there was a buzz that she could contest from the Congress’ Amethi bastion in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHer Parliament bow comes at a critical time for her party and the opposition INDIA bloc, both of which have struggled to convince voters that it is a viable alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP.\n\nHer presence in the Lok Sabha will add a new dimension to the party’s strategy, particularly in the context of the southern states and its women voters.\n\nMs Gandhi will now join a list of MPs who have at least one family member in either house of the Parliament.\n\nSamajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and his wife Dimple Yadav are both members of the Lok Sabha.

But I also hate going out smelling like Indian food,” she said, outlining what she does to avoid the smell of Indian spices and onion on her clothes.\n\nMs Chauhan said she has dedicated “cooking clothes” which she wears while cooking, and that she immediately changes out of office wear after returning home.\n\n“The smell of the onion, garlic and spices really sticks to the clothes that you’re wearing. So it is worth it to have clothes that you cook in and always, always change out of office clothes as soon as you come back home,” she said.\n\n“I also change my clothes before going out so that they don’t have that lingering smell of cooking.”\n\nMs Chauhan also warned people against wearing jackets near the kitchen. “If the smell sticks to your jacket, it’s not going away till you dry clean your jackets. And even then, it might not.”\n\nShe also suggested keeping jackets in closed closets.\n\n“In fact, whenever I start cooking, I close the closet doors, the bedroom doors, the entry way closet door, and the door to the washer and dryer area. I also turn on the vent and open the balcony gate,” she added.\n\nIf you like, you can also swap the pungent-smelling red onion for the less pungent white onion – the food won’t taste the same though.”\n\nThe viral video, which has more than eight million views, triggered a wave of remarks in the comments section, with some appreciating the Indian woman for her tips.\n\nOthers, however, criticised her for reinforcing racial stereotypes tied to Indian culture.\n\n“I think this is a white people concept,” one user said.\n\nSome users came to the content creator’s defence, arguing that she was simply sharing practical tips, reported India Today.\n\nOne user, Ms Alekhya, pointed out that unlike in India, the scent of Indian food tends to linger more in homes in the West. “This isn’t about ‘whitewashing’, but rather, dealing with the persistent after-smell of onions. No matter how much perfume you use, the scent can be hard to eliminate,” she said.\n\nUser Anu suggested that heating coffee powder in a pan is a way to neutralise the smell of food.\n\nOther users praised Ms Chauhan for her authenticity and practical advice. Supportive comments included “Everyone should appreciate this video,” and “I wish every Indian is as great as you.”\n\nWith more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, Ms Chauhan often shares relatable content about her experiences as an Indian living abroad.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d5aedc4b9324af9b5c04daea9d059a25b842c6e96daf9b02c3ae3dde27da03f9?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

This would mean that he has turned 15 by now.\n\nThe player’s father Sanjiv Suryavanshi, who did not address the interview issue, said that Vaibhav had undergone an Indian cricket board (BCCI) bone test at the age of eight and a half, and that he would be happy to undergo another one.\n\n“When he was eight and a half years old, he took a BCCI bone test. We don’t fear anyone. He can again undergo an age test,” Mr Suryavanshi told the Press Trust of India.\n\n“My son has worked hard. At the age of eight years, he excelled at U-16 district trials. I would take him for his cricket coaching to Samastipur (city in Bihar) and then take him back.”\n\nTalking about how Rajasthan picked Vaibhav, Mr Suryavanshi said: “Rajasthan Royals had called him for trials in Nagpur. Vikram Rathour sir (batting coach) gave a match situation where he had to score 17 in an over. He smashed three sixes. At trials, he hit eight sixes and four fours.”\n\nRajasthan coach Rahul Dravid said the franchise has been investing in young talents such as Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel.\n\n“I think he’s (Vaibhav) got some really good skills, so we thought it might be a good environment for him to grow in,” said Dravid. “Vaibhav came to our trials and we were really happy with what we saw.”\n\nHailing from Samastipur, Vaibhav has already made history in domestic cricket. He made his first-class debut for Bihar at 12 years and 284 days against Mumbai in the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy season.\n\nThe record was previously held by Indian stalwart Yuvraj Singh who made his debut at 15 years and 57 days.  The legendary Sachin Tendulkar started his career at 15 years and 230 days.\n\nVaibhav caught the attention of cricket experts during the Youth Test series against Australia earlier this year in Chennai, where he smashed 104 runs off just 62 balls. It made him the youngest centurion in the 170-year history of competitive cricket at 13 years and 188 days.\n\nHe broke the previous record of 14 years and 241 days held by Bangladesh’s current captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.\n\nLeft-hander Vaibhav also hit the fastest century by an Indian at the youth level.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIt is a touchy subject, affecting many Indians living in Singapore, especially those who had to leave British India after it was partitioned into India and Pakistan in August 1947.\n\nMillions of Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Sindhis were uprooted from their homes as violence raged. They endured untold suffering and pain as many of their kin were killed and had to relocate elsewhere, including Singapore, much against their will.\n\nOne fictional woman who witnessed that turbulent time – Sakina Begum – serves as the narrator for the HuM Theatre play Train to Pakistan, which was staged at the recent Kalaa Utsavam - Indian Festival of Arts 2024.\n\nThe elderly matriarch, living in Singapore, daringly faces her past as she shares her horrifying account with her granddaughter. She tells the story of her village, Mano Majra in Punjab, which was almost ripped apart overnight by the communal divide.\n\nPeople from different religions and castes had been living together in peace and harmony. Then suddenly, they had to see each other in different hues, with seeds of doubt sown by political leaders, government officials and thugs driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nThe story, Sakina indicates, is not limited to what happened in 1947. As powerfully shown towards the end of the play, it has since played out many times, most recently in Gaza and Ukraine, where locals have been upturned by unforeseen events.\n\nKhushwant Singh’s 1956 novel Train to Pakistan is considered the perfect narrative of the tragedy that gripped Punjab in 1947. Set in the fictional border village of Mano Majra, it depicts the trauma of the people who either had to leave or could do very little against the divisive forces that ran riot.\n\nCrunching the novel’s four impactful sections into a 105-minute play of seamless action is surely a tough task, considering there are so many characters, storylines and layers of developments.\n\nCredit must be given to scriptwriter Subin Subiah, who captures the emotions and major incidents while keeping the pathos and tragedy intact. He also gives it a contemporary touch with the use of English dialogues, and sometimes even Singlish.\n\nThe performances across the board are exemplary. Director Daisy Irani stands out in the role of Sakina and the Sikh ruffian Jagga’s mother. Daisy, who is HuM Theatre’s artistic director, is also the play’s narrator.\n\nCentral characters Jagga and Iqbal, the communist whose pearls of wisdom fall on deaf ears, are essayed perfectly by seasoned actors Shrey Bhargava and Gautam Marathe.\n\nThe supporting cast ensure they are not overlooked either, including Aizuddin Nasser as the police sub-inspector, Subin as the pleasure-loving district magistrate, Aditya Mazumdar as the tea seller and Ashie Singh as Jagga’s Muslim lover Nooran.\n\nSuch is the quality of casting that it is not immediately apparent that each of them play two or three roles. The actors move in and out perfectly, all deftly handled by movement coach Sharda Harrison.\n\nThe sound and visual effects underscore the play’s excellent production and presentation. It is the first time that surround sound is used for an Indian play in Singapore, and the result is captivating, with Chennai-based sound designer Sai Shravan Shravanam’s special effects successfully transporting the audience back to 1947.\n\nHuM employs a minimalist approach but the set design complements the unfolding drama, along with the works by multimedia designer Kenny Yek and the lighting by Alberta Wileo heightening every emotional twist.\n\nThe visual effects are also impressive, especially scenes of the pyre and of Jagga – at the end – climbing a bridge to cut off the rope that would have killed many atop a moving train. Those scenes brought an almost cinematic effect to the stage.\n\nTrain to Pakistan exemplifies the sheer power of storytelling. It masterfully captures the turbulent emotions of partition, blending raw human suffering with moments of unexpected tenderness.\n\nAt the heart of it lies a love story between a Sikh and a Muslim. The twist which comes at the end – Jagga giving up his life to save hundreds destined to fall prey to vengeance – stamps upon the importance of love, and that it is unquestionably the greatest thing in the world, beyond hate, respect or wealth.\n\nMany in the audience were emotionally overwhelmed by the play, giving the performers a standing ovation.\n\nThat all eight shows were sold out is testimony to how much it is today’s story as it is history’s.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cb2910a18c3a47f7f28898e4b55ec3c726a8533b9eac31f28e5f549f840e3e83?w=825", "alt_text": "The cast of Train To Pakistan by HuM Theatre."}]}

After eight weeks, they underwent a 30-minute downhill treadmill run to induce muscle damage, immediately consuming their daily serving of almonds or pretzels afterwards.\n\nThe researchers measured perceived muscle soreness, muscle performance (through a muscle contraction test and vertical jump) and blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation, such as C-reactive proteins and creatine kinase.\n\nMeasurements were taken before the treadmill run and at 24, 48, and 72 hours afterwards, during which participants continued their daily intake of almonds or pretzels.\n\nDuring the recovery period – up to 72 hours after the treadmill run – the group consuming almonds showed lower levels of creatine kinase, indicating less muscle damage.\n\nAdditionally, the almond group demonstrated better muscle performance at both 24 and 72 hours following the treadmill run.\n\nPain levels in participants who ate almonds were found to be about 37 per cent and 33 per cent lower at 24 and 48 hours, respectively, compared with those consuming pretzels.\n\n“This study demonstrates that 2.0 ounces per day of almonds modestly reduces pain, better maintains muscle strength and reduces the (creatine kinase) response to eccentric-based exercise,” the authors wrote.\n\nThe results add to the growing body of evidence regarding almonds’ role in post-exercise recovery, they said.\n\n“Almonds contain a wide range of nutrients known to support exercise recovery, including protein, antioxidants and phytonutrients,” said Mark Kern, a professor of exercise and nutritional sciences at San Diego State University.\n\nThese nutrients are provided in a whole food package, as opposed to isolated vitamin supplements, which may explain the benefits observed in this study.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c046332b341916e26554d554aec937bca45d24622e164dc2d57e03eaa31b9ed7?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Because (President Tharman) believes in music and he has mentioned about my musicality in several of his speeches, so I’m so happy to receive the award from him.”\n\nHe added that the President spoke to him about the revival of Hindustani music and Malay music in their pre-ceremony private engagement.\n\nThe other Cultural Medallion honoree, artist Siew Hock Meng, 82, is a second-generation artist known for his portraiture as well as paintings of realist landscapes in Singapore and in the region.\n\nPresident Tharman, who was the guest of honour at the ceremony, said in a statement that this year’s artists – who also include four Young Artist Award (YAA) recipients – “express the breadth of character and imagination we aspire for in Singapore culture”.\n\nUsually held at the Istana, which is undergoing restoration works currently, the Cultural Medallion ceremony took place at the National Gallery.\n\nThe award comes with an $80,000 grant for each recipient to support his artistic pursuits.\n\nDr Ghanavenothan is the first Indian classical musician to receive the award. He is the resident music director at Bhaskar’s Arts Academy, and his cross-cultural musical education encompasses Indian, Thai, Chinese and Indonesian traditions. He was also the first Indian classical musician to be awarded the YAA in 1995.\n\nHis practice began when he was a teenager, involving intensive, one-on-one sessions with guru Pandit M. Ramalingam, a friend of his father, pioneer musician R. Retnam.\n\n“Without practice, I wouldn’t get my breakfast,” Dr Ghanavenothan said.\n\n“I was rushing to practise, so I could eat and go to school. But when I made a mistake, my father would say, ‘Eh?’, and turn to me. I couldn’t bluff him.”\n\nA critically acclaimed composer and flautist and the founder of Singapore’s first Carnatic flute ensemble, Dr Ghanavenothan is best known for his cross-cultural creations, which he has taken to festivals in India, Taiwan and Bali.\n\n“When I received the phone call about the Cultural Medallion, first I screamed, then I started crying. It was so overwhelming. I have got many awards, but this is the one, this is the one for me,” he said.\n\nThe award, Singapore’s most prestigious arts accolade, was initiated in 1979 by then Minister for Culture Ong Teng Cheong, who was the Republic’s president from 1993 to 1999. It has been given to 137 artists since its inception.\n\nOn Nov 27, Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth, and Trade and Industry Alvin Tan also presented four promising artists aged 35 years and below with the YAA. They are violinist Alan Choo Su Ho, 34; music director, producer and composer Evan Low Jun Feng, 35; film producer Tan Si En, 31; and printmaker Zhang Fuming, 35.\n\nAll four will be eligible for a grant of $20,000 to support their artistic development within two years.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\n“When I received the phone call about the Cultural Medallion, first I screamed, then I started crying.

Kavi\n\nரவி சிங்காரம்\n\nAfter dinner with friends in Little India on a Sunday evening, migrant worker Venkatesan was walking to the bus stop along Clive Street when he had an overwhelming urge to use the toilet.\n\nWith no public toilet in sight and apprehensive about using the washroom at a nearby restaurant, he resorted to urinating in a drain along a dark alley.\n\nHis experience is not an uncommon one. According to many, the lack of toilet facilities in Little India is a major problem, especially during weekends and festivals. The area gets notably crowded on Sunday, when migrant workers have their day off and shoppers descend on Mustafa Centre in Syed Alwi Road. Crowds tend to gather as well at the open spaces in Tekka Lane and Lembu Road.\n\nMr Yousuf Rajid, a resident in Buffalo Road, expressed in Tamil a sentiment shared by many: “One side of the parking lot at Tekka Centre has become like a public toilet. I can’t walk that way ever; the smell of urine is unbearable.”\n\nThe same problem, according to other residents, also persists at residential estates in Klang Lane and Rowell Road.\n\nThough there are public toilets at shopping malls, restaurants and MRT stations in the area, the overall dearth of toilet facilities proves challenging for many patrons and shoppers.\n\nAware of the issue, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been providing portable toilets in several parts of Little India since 2009.\n\nCurrently, a total of 23 portable toilets are available at open spaces in Tekka Lane, Chitty Road and Lembu Road.\n\nThese “porta-loos” are open for use from Friday evening to noon on Monday. Since November, however, the porta-loos in Tekka Lane have been open during weekdays as well.\n\nHowever, 70 per cent of the 160 people polled by Tamil Murasu (TM) said this was not enough – especially on Sundays.\n\nAt Lembu Road, for instance, though there are 13 porta-loos available, queues on Sundays stretch as long as 15m for each.\n\n“Little India has enough toilets on normal days. However, the number is insufficient for the number of foreign workers who gather on Sundays,” said Mr Rajkumar Chandra, senior adviser from Little India Shopkeepers & Heritage Association (LISHA).\n\nThe poll also revealed a lack of public toilets in the vicinity of Klang Lane, Chander Road and Hindoo Road – places where migrant workers gather and dine.\n\nAt Kudai Canteen in Chander Road, toilets are closed at 9.15pm even though the eatery closes at 10.30pm. Diners are then left having to trek to Little India MRT station or Tekka Centre to use the toilet.\n\nA number of coffee shops and restaurants along Kampong Kapor Road, Clive Street and Perak Road allow the public to use their toilets, but staff at those establishments say their toilets are often damaged as a result.\n\n“Sometimes we get long queues of people just wanting to use the toilet. And our paying customers are inconvenienced by this,” said an employee at a vegetarian restaurant in Clive Street.\n\n“On weekends, the number of people who consume alcohol is higher, so the need to go to the toilet is also higher. And we understand that the migrant workers don’t have a nearby public toilet they can use.”\n\nNEA said it plans to increase the number of portable toilets in Little India by more than 50 per cent, especially in areas with high footfall.\n\nIn late October, NEA added two portable toilets at an open field in Tekka Lane.\n\nMr Jack Sim, founder of the World Toilet Organisation and Restroom Association (Singapore), said that the entry fee at existing public toilets may deter migrant workers from using them.\n\n“Some of the toilets are charging 20, 30 and 50 cents per entry, which helps in covering cleaning costs. But due to the fee, people try not to use the toilet and there is a lot of urine suppression,” he said.\n\n“Also, the portable toilets may be far away and not easily identified. There needs to be sufficient signage so people know where these facilities are.\n\n“The portable toilets are also not maintained or cleaned regularly enough. These plastic portable toilets may not be suitable for such heavy usage.”\n\nWhile the porta-loos go a long way towards mitigating the issue, many have issues with using them.\n\n“The smell makes me nauseous just walking in,” said migrant worker Philip, who said he occasionally has to queue for around 15 minutes just to use the portable toilets in Lembu Road.\n\nOthers said the toilets were difficult to use because it provided toilet paper instead of a hose.\n\n“This poses a problem to many South Indians,” said Mr Mohd Aziz, who works at a phone repair shop in Cuff Road. “Many of us are used to using a bidet or at least a hose after using the toilet.”\n\nThe facilities are also often cluttered with litter – paper towels, drink cans and tobacco packets.\n\nThe portable toilets are cleaned twice a day on weekends – but the facilities become dirty within a couple of hours. Most porta-loos are also dimly lit or completely dark at night, making them difficult to use, and the toilet seat sanitizer dispensers are often non-functional, say some workers.\n\n“Cleaning the toilets four to five times is sufficient for a normal day. But on Sundays, they need to be cleaned once every hour,” said Mr Sim.\n\n“Dirty toilets are, of course, dangerous because of the risk of catching a disease.”\n\nThe portable toilets are reportedly cleaned twice a day on weekends, which some say isn’t enough.\n\nPhotos: T.

But with the support of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) through counseling and financial aid, Ms Nageswari is paving a brighter future for her family.\n\nHer children are among the 8,500 beneficiaries of Sinda’s annual Back to School Festival (BTSF), which gives out vouchers to underprivileged students to help them prepare for the new academic year.\n\nThe vouchers aim to ease the financial burdens for students from low-income families ahead of the new school year. They include $140 for Popular Bookstore and $60 for Bata Singapore, distributed via the SINDA Wallet app.\n\nThe launch event on Nov 23 at Resorts World Sentosa was graced by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and SINDA president Indranee Rajah.\n\nIt included a visit to Universal Studios Singapore for students and their families.\n\n“Receiving SINDA’s Back To School vouchers feels like a weight lifted off my shoulders,” said Ms Nageswari, a teacher who is pursuing a degree in childcare education through SINDA’s Women Empowerment Fund.\n\n“These vouchers give my children the chance to begin their school year free from financial worries. SINDA’s support has been instrumental in our journey, and my children are thriving because of it.”\n\nThis year’s BTSF – its 17th edition – marks an 18 per cent increase in beneficiaries, with the revised Per Capita Income criteria raised from $1,000 to $1,600, enabling more families to qualify for the programme.\n\nSINDA has observed a growing need for its initiatives, with 7,024 parents and children supported in 2023, up from 6,469 in 2022. To further expand its reach, SINDA will allocate $7.8 million next year for financial assistance, on top of the $1.7 million invested this year in Back To School vouchers.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Ms Indranee emphasised the importance of these efforts: “SINDA recognises every student’s potential, and we have a collective responsibility to ensure they have the necessary support to succeed.\n\n“A strong family foundation is vital for a child’s success. By investing in students and strengthening families, we are paving the way for Singapore’s continued progress.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/61226cf91e2a1e020cac35ebeba0a4b890ab9a6b6bf67b47510391b8018bd02d?w=825", "alt_text": "Minister Indranee Rajah at the Back to School Festival at Resorts World Sentosa last weekend."}]}

But it was far from.\n\nJustice K.V. Viswanathan narrated in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, while hearing a petition that sought tough guidelines to tackle unruly fliers, that the Sept 15 flight he took with fellow judge Surya Kant soon turned into a nightmare due to two drunk male passengers.\n\nAccording to NDTV, the judges were seated in the front row, close to the toilet.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into the flight, some passengers started complaining about a male who had been in the toilet for a long while and was not responding to knocks on the door.\n\nAround the time, another male flier walked towards the toilet, and puked into an air sickness bag.\n\nThe sight left the passengers, including the two senior judges, unsettled.\n\nThe all-female flight crew repeatedly knocked on the toilet’s door, but there was no response. Though they had a master key, they were hesitant to use it as they were unaware of the male passenger’s condition.\n\nThey requested another male flier to open the door, and he found the passenger drunk and asleep inside the lavatory.

It is often used to say “great” or “all good”, and underscores the prevalence of hand gestures in human communication especially in many Asian and Mediterranean countries.\n\nIncidentally, at the top of the emoji hierarchy is the “Face with Tears of Joy”, which symbolizes extreme happiness and uncontrollable laughter.\n\nThe Italians are perhaps the world leaders in hand gestures (the Greeks are a very close second). So much so that it’s sometimes jokingly said that the way to render an Italian speechless is to tie his wrists together – behind his back.\n\nPeople resort to using their hands while speaking to emphasise certain points. I do it completely unintentionally when I’m really enthusiastic. My hands, sometimes, just fly.\n\nProfessor Spencer Kelly of Colgate University in the United States and co-director of the school’s Center for Language and Brain says that hand gestures come to us naturally.\n\nHe adds that even blind people use hand gestures when speaking to other blind people.\n\nOther studies conducted at the University of Chicago suggest that gesturing not only helps others remember what you say, it also helps you speak more quickly and effectively.\n\nAs a test, try describing a spiral staircase without moving your hand.\n\nResearch shows that gestures enhance the effectiveness of spoken messages by more than 65 per cent, and that audiences are more convinced by what they see rather than what they hear.\n\n“Politicians use (hand) gestures all the time to get their message across,” says Dr Hans Rutger Bosker at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands.\n\nNot everyone taps the power of body language, though, especially in this digital age.\n\nWhen you consider that close to 90 per cent of the information our brains process during video calls comes from what we see, the question beckons: Why do we restrict ourselves to a tight headshot?\n\nRather, we should frame ourselves in a landscape format so that our arms are visible down to the elbows. Our audience can then see us using our hands to emphasise our points of view.\n\nOf course, we should keep our gestures appropriate. Nothing too offensive or wild, please.\n\nI’m nervous for those who are on the phone while driving. Even while using a headset, hand gestures for such individuals could have catastrophic ramifications.\n\nBy Khush Randhawa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8b047be31ff56555e0a3e9fdb2cffcf45acbe7088ce337a5bdc50945de4ebcd5?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

It also named the movies that have been impacted by such reviews and claimed that their producers suffered financial losses.\n\nTFAPA general secretary T. Siva told the Times of India: “A review should be a view rather than an individual attack. These days, people hold vengeance against a particular movie or star, get personal and say no one should watch the film. This cannot be considered a review. If you bash a brand’s product, they would not be quiet and would, in turn, take the legal route.”\n\nThe TFAPA statement comes days after the Suriya-starrer Kanguva was trolled heavily on social media platforms. In a post on X, the actor’s wife Jyotika condemned the “negativity” around the film even before the first show of the movie ended.\n\n“In 2024, Indian 2, Vettaiyan and Kanguva have been affected by such public reviews/talk uploaded by YouTube channels,” said TFAPA. “Critics have every right to review movies. But we request all journalists to write film reviews keeping in mind that hatred towards a film should not be sown in the media because of personal malice.\n\n“It is condemnable that many YouTube channels cross all limits in their criticism and project their view as the universal truth. We saw an old man not just sharing his opinion about Kanguva but also indulging in personal attacks. It was shocking.”\n\nTelugu movie producers too are reportedly in favour of a ban on YouTube reviews.\n\nProducer Dil Raju recently said the issue has often been discussed in the Telugu states, with exhibitors and producers claiming they affect the film’s earnings.\n\nIn Kerala, the High Court in November 2023 issued a directive to the authorities to stop online reviews of films by social media influencers, YouTube reviewers and bloggers for seven days following the release of a film.\n\nThe plea was primarily made by Mubeen Rauf, director of Aromalinte Adyathe Pranayam, and was supported by the producers’ association.\n\nThe Kerala High Court also identiﬁed “review bombing” as an issue.\n\nThe term refers to some YouTubers and social media influencers allegedly blackmailing filmmakers and demanding payments to write favourable reviews or to refrain from publishing negative ones.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/562765c76b131eb37cc2e4335a81a5fb3b42d5d4fc8ebe711609c818bd741a90?w=825", "alt_text": "A still from the movie Kanguva."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAt the five-star Equarius Hotel, not far from the S.E.A. Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa, a “fish tank” is being carefully prepared.\n\nThe special creation, however, will not host any sea specimens over the next three weeks. Instead, from Nov 25, it will enclose the stage for the World Chess Championship title clash between China’s reigning champion Ding Liren and India’s young contender Gukesh Dommaraju.\n\n“The players will be playing in an isolated room, with serene conditions to prevent external interference,” said Singapore Chess Federation CEO Kevin Goh. “Spectators can view the players in action only through the ‘fish tank’, which will work like a one-way mirror.\n\n“At any one time, only 300 spectators are allowed inside the playing hall to watch the contest through the ‘fish tank’.\n\nThe World Chess Championship begins with an opening ceremony at the Capitol Theatre on Nov 23. Thereafter, the action will switch to Sentosa, with Gukesh and Ding starting their first match on Nov 25 at 5pm.\n\nThey will play 14 matches in total till Dec 15, with the first player to win 7\n\n1/\n\n2\n\ngames taking the title. If the score is equal after 14 games, the winner is decided by a tie-break. There are rest days after Games 3, 6, 9 and 12.\n\n“Undoubtedly, this is a unique event that will create intrigue and suspense in this country and overseas,” said Goh. “Hosting this tournament will further cement Singapore’s reputation as the region’s capital for sporting events.”\n\nAlready, the Ding and Gukesh clash is being viewed through a geopolitical lens, symbolising not just Asia’s ascendance on the global chess stage long dominated by Europe and America, but also taking place at a time of growing rivalry between China and India.\n\nSingapore is in the spotlight as the platform where geopolitics will be in play, in a way not dissimilar to the attention focused on the Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un summit in 2018 and the Ma Ying-jeou-Xi Jinping meeting in 2015.\n\nThe atmosphere will also be similar to what happened at Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1972, when the World Championship match between American genius Bobby Fischer and the Soviet Union’s Boris Spassky was widely viewed as being a challenge by the West against Soviet hegemony.\n\n“Chess is war over the board. The object is to crush the opponent’s mind”, Fischer said at the time.\n\nFor sure, millions of people in India and China will be rooting for their respective compatriot when the action unflods on Sentosa, with leaders Narendra Modi and Xi expected to watch the outcome closely.\n\nChina has been producing top players since 1976, while for a long while, India, where chess is said to have originated around the 6th century AD, has had only five-time world champion Vishwanathan Anand to speak of.\n\nOver the past five years, though, it has been a virtual chess revolution in India, with a host of youngsters now figuring in the world top 20.\n\nAt just 18, Gukesh, born in Chennai to a Telugu family originally hailing from Andhra Pradesh, is the youngest ever world title challenger in history. Should he emerge victorious, he will break Russian Garry Kasparov’s record for the youngest world chess champion at age 22, which has stood for 28 years.\n\nGukesh’s rapid rise has been nothing short of spectatcular even for a sport where child prodigies are the norm. With a mature and patient but aggressive playing style, his string of recent successes, including a record-breaking performance while leading India to a historic gold medal at the World Chess Olympiads in September, has meant that he is the strong favourite for the title.\n\nOn the other hand, Ding, 32, has been in poor form over the past year, and has publicly spoken about his struggles with depression.\n\nAt his peak, however, he has played brilliant chess, and he came back from behind three times in the World Chess Championship 2023 match to defeat his Russian opponent Ian Nepomniachtchi.\n\nIndian media believes his “depression” is a tactical ploy. Ding cannot be entirely written off, especially given his greater experience and resilience in high-stakes matches.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a93c2f23d08daa990b7c78788ee00e0a20291a56c69c9e334bbda5a89466281d?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

She enrolled at LASALLE College of the Arts, where she earned a master’s degree.\n\nToday, she is a celebrated artist represented by Australian gallery Sullivan+Strumpf. Her paintings are also featured in institutional and private collections in Singapore, and in galleries in Japan, Hong Kong, France, Australia and the United States.\n\nWhile pursuing her master’s, she also became a mother, and in 2015, returned to the corporate world as a consultant at telecommunications firm Telstra – all while maintaining her art business.\n\nLife, however, threw her a curveball in June 2020 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. An 11-month break followed, where she underwent treatment and a full recovery.\n\n“Cancer forced me to slow down and re-evaluate what truly mattered,” Ms Gupta said. “During my treatment, I had a lot of time to reflect and I asked myself if I had done enough to give back to society.”\n\nWhile the illness posed physical and emotional challenges, it also became the catalyst for her next venture. Ms Gupta launched vLookUp.ai in August 2021 – a mentorship platform aimed at empowering women by providing career guidance, bridging a gap she had experienced earlier in her life.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am today without my mentors’ guidance and encouragement throughout my career,” she said. “They showed me what was possible and gave me the confidence to pursue it,” Ms Gupta said. “Mentorship should not be a privilege constrained by socio-economic factors or geographic boundaries.”\n\nStarting with just 10 mentors and nine mentees, vLookUp.ai has grown to include over 369 mentors and 1,200 mentees spanning 30 countries and 400 organisations.\n\nSpeaking to Tabla at the sidelines of the Singapore Women In Tech’s (SGWIT) 5th anniversary event on Nov 18, Ms Gupta underlined the importance of initiatives like SGWIT in advancing gender equity in the industry.\n\n“Women in technology still face systemic challenges, but we’ve made significant progress over the past decade,” she said. “I see more women in leadership roles now, but we still have a long way to go before achieving true parity.”\n\nvLookUp.ai is among 23 organisations participating in SGWIT’s new Relaunch programme, announced at the anniversary event. It is an initiative by IMDA (Infocomm Media Development Authority) and NTUC LearningHub to support women in the technology sector as they navigate their return to the workforce after a career break.\n\nThe Relaunch programme will focus on four key areas: Offering structured courses, providing career integration support, facilitating guidance from experienced mentors, and connecting women with networking and employment opportunities.\n\nMs Gupta, who moved to Singapore from Mumbai with her husband in 2005, said vLookUp.ai’s ongoing collaboration with polytechnics in Singapore has borne fruit. At Republic Polytechnic, for example, some 50 young women have benefited from mentorship opportunities.\n\n“Our mentorship programme provides these girls with guidance, coaching and career direction, helping them navigate decisions such as whether to pursue higher studies or enter the workforce,” Ms Gupta explained.\n\n“Through our platform, they can ask practical questions about career changes or how to break into fields like data science or cybersecurity.”\n\nParticipants maintain continuous contact with their mentors, ensuring support and guidance long after the formal programme concludes.\n\nMs Gupta advised women returning to the workforce to reconnect with their network on platforms such as LinkedIn. “When women take a break, the first thing that gets hit is their confidence level,” she said.\n\n“Consider seeking mentorship and guidance on industry trends, resumes and interviews, while also exploring online certifications in relevant areas to enhance your skills.”\n\nAbove all, Ms Gupta stressed the need for confidence and perseverance: “It may take time, but just keep at it. Believe in yourself and stay committed to learning and growing.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6213ead8ef1aaf0d91e13b755479aed46af4601e0f79214e46882bbacad640a1?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Kanchana Gupta founder of vLookUp.Ai"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingapore’s youngest chess grandmaster Siddharth Jagadeesh believes the World Chess Championship, which will take place at Resorts World Sentosa from Nov 25 to Dec 15, will attract a lot of interest in the sport.\n\nAfter all, it was also how he himself got hooked on the game after watching the 2013 World Championship clash in Chennai between India’s Viswanathan Anand, the reigning champion at the time, and Norway’s Magnus Carlsen, the sport’s current No. 1.\n\n“It will surely interest a lot of kids,” said the 17-year-old who attained chess’ highest rank on May 21 at the Sharjah Masters in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n“At every World Championship, there’s usually something new that we learn about chess. I’m not sure what it will be, but I’m sure we will learn something from the Singapore event.”\n\nSiddharth is a year younger than India’s Gukesh Dommaraju, who is the youngest contender ever for the world title. The Indian will take on China’s Ding Liren over 14 matches in Singapore.\n\n“I have known Gukesh since he was a kid and have been following him,” said Siddharth.  “He is a strong player and has improved very fast. Ding too is a very strong player. Their contest, for sure, will be interesting.\n\n“I learn from their games, but they are too good for me to try and copy.”\n\nSiddharth is tipping Gukesh to win because the Indian is in top form. Ding, on the other hand, has a had a poor run in recent months.\n\n“Indian players are currently doing very well at the world level because there’s a lot of competition among themselves. They push each other really hard,” said Siddharth.\n\n“I think it’ll be a close match; it won’t be a blowout.”\n\nSiddharth, who was born in India and moved to Singapore when he was 1½ years old, started playing chess when he was seven.\n\n“My dad liked chess, and he taught me,” said the teenager, who gained Singapore citizenship with his family in 2022.\n\nHis parents Jagadeesh Balakrishnan, a 47-year-old delivery lead, and Anitha Jagadeesh, 42, a programme manager, have spent large sums of money to provide him with the best playing opportunities.\n\nSiddharth, a grade 11 student, equivalent to the first year of junior college, claimed the international master title – the second-highest rank in chess – in March 2022.\n\nFollowing that, however, he hit a plateau. For about a year, his Fide (International Chess Federation) rating remained in the 2,380-2,420 range. Siddharth then realised he was too “conservative” in his play and paid too much respect to his opponents.\n\nHe adopted a riskier approach and reaped the rewards last May, when he beat three higher-ranked players en route to becoming Singapore’s fifth and youngest chess grandmaster.\n\n“It felt good to become grandmaster,” said Siddharth, who has a current rating of 2,510. “It was a big relief that I finally achieved it.”\n\nHe had initially set targets for what he wanted to achieve by a certain age – but Covid derailed those plans.\n\nThe teenager will compete in the upcoming Singapore International Open, which will take place alongside the World Championship at Resorts World Sentosa from Nov 29 to Dec 5.\n\nV.K.

Nayanthara played the female lead in the film, which was written and directed by her now-husband Vignesh Shivan.\n\nThe couple met while working on the film, got engaged in 2021, and married the following year.\n\nIn her Instagram post, Nayanthara said she and her husband spent two years seeking permission to use footage, photographs, songs, and lyrics from Naanum Rowdy Dhaan in the documentary titled Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairytale, but were unable to obtain a No Objection Certificate.\n\nThe couple felt it was important to include video from the 2015 film as it marked their first meeting and is an integral part of Nayanthara’s life.\n\nHer post read: “After two years of battling it out with you for an NOC and waiting for your approval for our Netflix documentary release, we finally decided to give up, re-edit and settle for the current version since you declined to permit the usage of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan songs or visual cuts, even the photographs to say the least despite multiple requests.”\n\nAccording to Nayanthara’s post, they decided to use a three-second clip that was “shot on our personal devices and that too BTS visuals that are already very much publicly present on social media”.\n\n“This is an all time low from you and speaks so much about your character. I wish you were half the person you portray to be on stage in front of your innocent fans, but clearly you do not practise what you preach,” she wrote.\n\nShivan also shared a 10-second video on his Instagram stories, showing him talking to Nayanthara on the set of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan.\n\nThe caption read: “The 10 crores clip that wants to be taken down from our Netflix documentary. Please watch it here for free.”\n\nNayanthara’s letter claimed that they received the lawsuit from Dhanush after the trailer for the documentary was released last week.\n\nAccording to local news reports, Dhanush’s legal representatives have emphasised that he is the sole owner of all media associated with the film Naanum Rowdy Dhaan.\n\nNayanthara’s post claimed that Dhanush’s lawsuit stems not from concerns over copyright but from his personal relationship with the actress.\n\n“It is understandable if it is business compulsions and monetary issues that mandate your denial; but it hurts that this decision of yours is only to vent out your personal grudge against us and that you have deliberately remained indecisive this long,” she stated.\n\nDhanush and his team have not responded to the allegations publicly.\n\nActor Dhanush.\n\n“I wish you were half the person you portray to be on stage in front of your innocent fans, but clearly you do not practise what you preach.”\n\nNayanthara in an Instagram post directed at Dhanush", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/acc2c975ca396461c564466d550e23c7ddb8ea64f7ab445260b878ea3505782a?w=825", "alt_text": "Nayanthara and her director-husband Vignesh Shivan."}]}

Even the throne of God might tremble at the weight of broken hearts.”\n\nAcknowledging the emotional difficulty of the moment, Rahman also conveyed a message of seeking meaning and understanding in the midst of the pain. He thanked friends and well-wishers for their support and for respecting their privacy during this challenging time.\n\nHe then used #arrsairaabreakup with the post, which triggered a barrage of criticism from netizens in the comments section.\n\nOne user wrote: “Who creates a hashtag for this situation?

Iyer, on the other hand, has been in Singapore for years, and, like many Singaporean Indians, loves his football.\n\nAnd this, dear reader, is where things get interesting.\n\nIt’s a Sunday morning, and the neighborhood is buzzing with the smell of fresh vadai, coffee and heated arguments. Rao and Iyer have been meeting at this spot every weekend for a friendly chat (which often turns into a full-blown debate) about the merits of their respective sports.\n\nToday’s debate? “Which game is better: cricket or football?”\n\nThe Pitch (literally and figuratively)\n\nRao begins, leaning forward: “Iyer, cricket is not just a game. It’s a legacy, a tradition! Our people have been watching cricket for over a century. You can’t just dismiss it with a wave of your hand.”\n\n“Legacy?” laughs Iyer, waving his hand dismissively. “Cricket takes so long! By the time a match finishes, I could watch three football games. Efficiency, my friend. Football is for people who value time.”\n\nRao raises his eyebrows. “Have you ever felt the tension of the last over? The drama, the suspense? In football, you kick a ball, score a goal, and that’s it.”\n\n“That’s the beauty of it,” says Iyer, not missing a beat. “Football is simple. It doesn’t need an instruction manual. You need an encyclopedia just to understand the scoring in cricket. And what about all those drink breaks? It’s like a tea party with a game in between!”\n\nThe Art of the Game\n\nRao, visibly offended, takes a deep breath. “Football may be simple, but cricket is art,” he declares. “Bowlers setting traps, batsmen anticipating the bowler’s next move – it’s all strategy. One delivery can change everything!”\n\nIyer, shaking his head, says: “Oh please, football is a real-time thriller. You can’t pause to think, you just act! Footballers have to run, think and score throughout 90 minutes. In cricket, everyone stands around waiting. I bet the grass on the pitch grows faster than the game moves!”\n\n“Standing around?!” Rao looks as if he’s been slapped. “Do you know how much concentration it takes to be a fielder in cricket? One slip and the game is gone. It’s a mind game.”\n\n“Mind game?” Iyer chuckles. “In football, the only ‘mind game’ you need is the mental strength to keep running when you’re exhausted. That’s stamina, Rao. Stamina.”\n\nRao scoffs: “You call running in shorts stamina? Try standing in the sun in full gear for five days straight during a Test match. That’s stamina.”\n\nHeroes and Legends\n\nThe argument pauses as they take a sip of their coffee, both glancing around to make sure they’re not disturbing the other patrons – though by now, the entire cafe is listening.\n\nRao clears his throat and decides to shift tactics. “And another thing – our heroes. Look at Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni. These are legends. Icons! Who do you have in football? David Beckham? Isn’t he more famous for his hairstyles?”\n\nIyer rolls his eyes. “Excuse me, but we have Pele, Maradona, Messi. Football legends have whole stadiums named after them!”\n\n“Yes, but do footballers have streets named after them in India?” asks Rao, smugly. “Every city in India has a Sachin Tendulkar road somewhere. Cricket is in our blood.”\n\nIyer shrugs. “Singaporean Indians love football. And you know, the rest of the world watches football, too.”\n\nBringing Families Together (Or Not)\n\n“What about family time?” Rao argues. “Cricket brings families together. You’re glued to the TV for hours. It’s like bonding. A five-day Test match? A mini-family reunion!”\n\nIyer laughs. “That’s your version of family bonding? In my house, when the football finishes, we have the rest of the day free. Family time and efficiency!”\n\nRao crosses his arms. “If you watched cricket together with your kids, they’d understand what patience and bonding are. Football’s too quick, it doesn’t teach you the same discipline.”\n\nIyer grins. “My kids don’t need five days to figure out who won a game.”\n\nThe Verdict?\n\nAs their debate reaches a crescendo, an elderly woman walks by and pats both uncles on their shoulders. “Boys, boys,” she says. “When are you two going to let this go?”\n\nThey both laugh, finally breaking their intense debate. Iyer raises his hands in mock surrender. “All right, Rao, maybe cricket has its charm, but only if you can teach me why the game pauses every 15 minutes.”\n\n“Only if you promise to teach me why football fans scream every time someone kicks the ball!” Rao laughs back.\n\nAnd so, the two men call a truce. They agree that perhaps the passion they hold for their respective sport is what makes both games special.\n\nThey also realise that there’s no actual end to the argument in the cricket-versus-football rivalry – and they wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nPhoto: EPA-EFE", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/88fdde097a7b4371c263083ab7ce5af109e8a07e0e106c6524dceaf34be52ee9?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

These confounded gadgets are taking the mickey out of us.\n\nHand these digital miscreants to someone younger and everything works perfectly. As a result, jokes about older adults not being able to handle modern technology are rampant – which is puzzling since we seniors have experienced more than our fair share of technological breakthroughs.\n\nWhen I started work in 1980, the office had a telex machine. By typing and creating little holes on a paper ribbon, we could exchange text with other telex subscribers over local and international telephone lines.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, the telex was replaced by the facsimile machine. Just place the document on the display panel and zap it off.\n\nAt the same time, manual typewriters were being replaced by electronic typewriters.

Unfortunately, how to go about doing all of that is beyond me.\n\nLike many older adults, I am confounded by tiny fonts, and rankled by the number of times I have to input or change my passwords.

And while the men were at work, their wives would meet for tea and get-together sessions in the afternoons.\n\nThis led to the formation of two women’s groups – the Lotus Club and the Ladies Union. The Lotus Club was launched in 1930 under the auspices of the Young Women’s Christian Association, with the objective of bringing together women from Indian and Ceylonese communities in recreation and friendship. The Ladies’ Union, on the other hand, was established in 1931 as an independent organisation run entirely by Indian and Ceylonese ladies.\n\nThe aim of the groups was the same – to bring women out of their traditional roles at home and give them an avenue to socialise, learn, showcase their talents and give back to society through various fund-raising efforts.\n\nIn 1950 the two groups merged to form the Kamala Club.\n\nMrs Sushiela Nair was only 20 when she joined the Kamala Club in 1957. She was the only local-born member at that time.\n\n“I had just gotten married at that time and women had nothing much to do in those days. The older women told me ‘Come Mrs Nair, come and join us’, that was how I joined them,” said Mrs Nair, now 87, in a previous interview with tabla!\n\nShe was one of around 150 people present at the Village hotel during the club’s Deepavali Nite celebrations last Saturday. And she was also one of the few given a lifetime acknowledgement award for her longstanding membership.\n\nAt the event, graced by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah, members performed dance numbers of different Indian genres, and in a special segment, brought the paintings of 19th century artist Raja Ravi Varma alive by walking the ramp in parallel with his artwork as a backdrop.\n\nIn line with the club’s ethos of charity work, gifts were collected towards Project Smile, a local charity that provides assistance to women from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nOn how the club was formed, club president Padmaja Yerramsetty said it happened when India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Singapore in 1950. It was his first state visit here.\n\nDuring his visit, the two women’s groups organised a tea reception for him and he asked them: “Why do you need two separate groups of women? Why don’t you combine them?”, recounted Ms Padmaja.\n\nThey accepted his suggestion and named the combined group Kamala Club, after Nehru’s wife Kamala.\n\nA clubhouse at Moulmein Road was built through donations and fund raising and officially opened in 1957. It was the first clubhouse in Singapore built for women and built by a woman contractor.\n\nBut it was acquired by the Government in 1985 for road development. The club got $32,000 as compensation, which was donated to the Singapore Indian Education Trust, the then Singapore National University and various charities.\n\nSince then, meetings have been held at members’ houses. But headquarters or not, the Kamala Club has continued to play a vital role in promoting women’s empowerment, cultural activities and community service.\n\n“The club focuses a fair bit on community integration, and through our tie-up with the People’s Association (PA), we showcase our Indian culture to the other communities during various events,” said Ms Padmaja, an entrepreneur who moved to Singapore from Bangalore in 1997 and has been a Kamala Club member since 2013.\n\n“During Racial Harmony Day and Children’s Day, for instance, we host activities like Rangoli and information booths about henna and mehndi.\n\n“We’ve also collaborated with organisations like SINDA for goodie-bag distribution to the underprivileged, and for breast cancer awareness, we did the ‘Pink Ribbon Walk’, where members walked 5km in sarees.”\n\nAside from charity drives and PA-related activities, members meet monthly for Indian-themed dinners, yoga sessions and cooking workshops.\n\nThe club has some 120 members based in Singapore, said Ms Padmaja, who adds that the total is actually 300, “if you count overseas members who lived in Singapore but have since moved abroad”.\n\nWith the influx of Indian expats to Singapore, membership numbers have seen an uptick in recent years.\n\n“Just this year alone, we’ve had 19 new members join us. There is a membership fee, but a lot of the proceeds go towards charity,” Ms Padmaja said.\n\n“Our intention is always to raise awareness of the Kamala Club to all Indian women in Singapore. And we hope more will join us in giving back to the wider community.”\n\nKamala club members with Indira Gandhi (centre, sitting) at the Club in Balestier.\n\nPhoto: Kamala Club\n\nIndia’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru being garlanded during his visit to Singapore in 1950.\n\nPhoto: Kamala Club\n\nThe old clubhouse in Moulmein Road.\n\n“Just this year alone, we’ve had 19 new members join us.

Kavi\n\nAnusha Selvamani\n\nThe S S Mohd Mydeen shop has been a cornerstone of a quiet neighbourhood in Dorset Road near Farrer Park for 40 years.\n\nKnown colloquially as “mama shops” (mama means uncle in Tamil), such standalone kiosks that sell provisions and sundry goods have been a fixture of HDB living for decades.\n\nSelling everything from soap and canned food to toys, these void deck sundry stores – widely appreciated for their proximity and convenience – were introduced by HDB in the 1970s. At their peak in the 1980s and 1990s, there were more than 500 such provision shops.\n\nBut many of these businesses have shut, and operators who still run them say earnings have fallen over the years as they face rising rental costs and growing pressure from supermarkets, convenience stores and online grocers. Newer HDB estates also have less expansive void decks which do not cater space for these stores.\n\nFigures from HDB, according to an ST report (published on Sept 27), show that the number of such shops has fallen over the years. In 2014, there were 380 of these provision shops; today, there are fewer than 240.\n\nMonthly rental typically costs about $2,000 depending on the location of the shop.\n\n“The future of shops like mine is bleak,” said Mr Mohammad Ishak, 62, who runs the S S Mohd Mydeen shop, which started in 1984 and has been passed down two generations.\n\n“This is more than a business for me; it’s history, family and community all in one. This is the only trade I know.”\n\nMr Ishak’s shop originally started in 1958 in Rowell Road in Little India, where his father and uncle ran the business. It later relocated to Bukit Panjang and then to Dorset Road.\n\nMr Ishak has maintained the shop’s facade and signboard since its first day in Dorset Road. “I did not carry out any renovation work to change the look of my shop. I want it to look as authentic as how a mama shop should be,” he said.\n\n“Last time, there were many schools in the vicinity, so the bulk of my customers were students. Now there is only one school nearby. Serving the children was joyful, as sometimes they wouldn’t have enough money to buy the things they need, but I would just let it go.”\n\nMr Ishak, a father of three who relies solely on his shop for a living, sells shaving blades, sewing kits, cosmetic items, dried fruits and tidbits – to keep the “nostalgia alive”.\n\nAfter surviving the pandemic, he adopted digital payment options and made his shop a Shopee parcel collection point.\n\nHe plans to run the shop for as long as he can, but accepts that the shop might have to shutter for good soon. “My two daughters and son studied well and have promising careers. I do not want them to take over this trade as it’s pointless,” he said.\n\nWhile many mama shop owners like Mr Ishak are looking to exit the trade, there are still some who are hopeful, such as Mr Ananth Krishnan, who six months ago opened Annachi Minimart in Marsiling.\n\nThe 43-year-old said he believes traditional provision shops still have a future.\n\n“I was inspired by my childhood memories of working in my dad’s mama shop back in Tamil Nadu,” said Mr Ananth, who worked as a technician for 20 years. “I wanted to bring that sense of warmth and familiarity back to Singapore.”\n\nWhile his minimart is a modern “upgrade” of a traditional-looking mama shop, Mr Ananth stocks it with the quintessential mama shop items, including masala powder and millets imported from India.\n\n“I know it won’t be easy, but I believe there’s still a place for us in this community,” he said. “People want that personal touch and that’s something big chains can’t offer.”\n\nEmbracing the digital age\n\nARV Stores was once a traditional mama shop in Changi Road for over 60 years, but recently underwent a renovation to embrace the conveniences of the digital age – and to better compete in Singapore’s modern retail landscape.\n\nMs Ramya Vadivelu, 32, who runs the shop with her husband, said the new convenience store platform has allowed her to expand her range of merchandise. She is also looking to implement home-delivery service to attract customers.\n\n“With rising rental costs and competition from larger convenience store chains, I decided it was time for change,” said Ms Ramya.\n\n“I believe that this blend of old and new is the future for traditional shops. My shop used to be very popular in the past, but now I can’t even see a profit of $10 on a normal day.\n\n“Customers are comparing mama shops with NTUC and Sheng Siong, which is not fair at all. We are already selling things at a cheaper price, but customers still bargain.”\n\nMany of these mama shops have been in neighbourhoods for so long that many patrons said they remind them of the years gone by.\n\n“Mama shops are woven into the fabric of local communities,” said Archana Begum, 36, a resident of Toa Payoh, where there used to be one such shop at every estate.\n\n“During my school days, they used to serve as gathering spots for students after school, and we cherished these places for their warm, familiar atmosphere.\n\n“In Toa Payoh now, there’s maybe one mama shop left… These shops form a huge part of Singapore’s heritage and they should be preserved.”\n\nIn recent years, the National Heritage Board has introduced heritage trails to preserve Singapore’s history and culture – and Mr Ishak’s shop is one of the spots listed on the Pek Kio Estate Heritage Trail, which was launched by non-profit organisation My Community.\n\n“It’s so heartening to know that my shop is one of the places people get to visit when they take part in the trail. With that I can attract more customers and hopefully, mama shops will never be forgotten,” said Mr Ishak.\n\nMr Ananth Krishnan, who opened Annachi Minimart in Marsiling six months ago.\n\nPhoto: T.

The two will square off again for the World Chess Championship in Singapore on Nov 25.\n\nPhoto: grandchesstour/x\n\nA clutch of prodigious Indian teens are snapping at chess world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen’s heels.\n\nOne of them, 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju, will face China’s Ding Liren in the World Chess Championship in Singapore on Nov 25. And Carlsen believes the world’s fifth-ranked player is the clear favourite to win the title.\n\nHe told the Hindustan Times that he is throwing his weight behind the grandmaster from Chennai who has stunned the chess world with his rapid strides over the past couple of years.\n\n“He’s playing the World Championship at 18 in what might seem like a fun experience. But there’s more than one billion people expecting him to win, so, I think even he cannot help but be somewhat affected by that, at least at the start,” said Carlsen, 33, who has held the No. 1 spot since July 2011.\n\n“Still, it will be the biggest moment of Gukesh’s career, and he will feel the pressure. The most likely scenario is that the match will start out a little bit nervy. There’s a chance that Gukesh wins a couple of games early. If that happens, the match will more or less be a whitewash.”\n\nGukesh made history by becoming the youngest player ever to win the Fide Candidates tournament last April, fending off a field packed with the world’s top players, including Hikaru Nakamura, Ian Nepomniachtchi and his compatriots R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi.\n\nHe eclipsed former world champion Garry Kasparov’s record (20 years, 11 months) by over three years, and is the only Indian other than his mentor Viswanathan Anand to win the Candidates title.\n\nThe World Championship clash in Singapore will see an Indian participant for the first time since Anand competed at Sochi in 2014.\n\nCarlsen, who hadn’t given Gukesh much chance of winning the Candidates title, admitted that his earlier estimation was well off the mark.\n\n“I didn’t think he was solid enough to sustain the kind of performance that he did in the Candidates and I was wrong… completely wrong,” said the Norwegian.\n\nThough reigning world champion Ding has been battling mental health issues and is a shadow of his former self, Carlsen – who most rivals find intimidating – confessed that he once “feared” the Chinese grandmaster.\n\n“Back in 2019, Fabiano (Caruana) and Ding were pretty much neck and neck. Ding was very, very strong then. Someone I massively respected and even feared,” said Carlsen.\n\nThe five-time world champion had some words of caution for Gukesh in his match against Deng.\n\nThe Indian’s performance at last month’s European Club Cup – where he started with two wins but then went on a five-game winless streak – revealed a few chinks in his armour, said the Norwegian.\n\n“That must be very encouraging for Ding,” said Carlsen. “You could see that Gukesh can be quite vulnerable at times and he sometimes doesn’t quite feel the moment when he needs to sort of slam the brakes and play solidly.”\n\nAlmost one month before his World Chess Championship duel with Ding, Gukesh experienced his first loss in classical format at the European Club Cup 2024 against 34-year-old Russian grandmaster Dmitry Andreikin. It was the Indian teen’s first defeat in the classical format in 38 games.\n\nAs the opening World Chess Championship match at Resorts World Sentosa looms, the event is taking place at a time of growing rivalry between Asian giants China and India – geopolitical rivals competing for leadership of the Global South in an increasingly multipolar world.\n\nIt is the first time India and China face-off for the world championship in a major sport.\n\nThe choice of Singapore as the host city for the championship match reflects not just Asia’s ascendance on the global chess stage long dominated by Europe and America, but also the growing role of the city-state as a venue for major events.\n\n“There’s a chance that Gukesh wins a couple of games early.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIf there is one novel emblematic of the partition of British India into India and Pakistan, it is Khushwant Singh’s epic, Train To Pakistan.\n\nThe historical novel, published in 1956, recounts the momentous division in August 1947 through the perspective of Mano Majra, a fictional border village.\n\nIt skirts the political events, but focuses on the moral confusion: How a small Punjab village with residents from all religions and sects – Sikhs, Muslims, Hindus and Sindhis – living in harmony was split overnight into various factions, and egged on by fanatics to violently clash among themselves.\n\nAmid the chaos lies the love of a Sikh man for a Muslim woman – a bond that stands as the last hope against the impending disaster that awaits the village.\n\nKhushwant, who was born in Punjab and noted for his trenchant secularism, used his personal experience to narrate the tumultuous turn of events with a sense of reality and horror.\n\nIn 1998, Indian director Pamela Rooks made a film on Train To Pakistan, which received mixed reviews. Over the years, multiple plays based on the novel have appeared on stage.\n\nNow, Singaporean theatre personality Daisy Irani has tried her hand at adapting it. Her production will be staged at the Esplanade’s Kalaa Utsavam – Indian Festival of Arts 2024 from Nov 20 to 24.\n\n“Telling it on stage is a tribute to this shared piece of history that we have with these minority communities in Singapore,” she told tabla!\n\n“The story is also a reminder that we live in times where communities and societies are being torn apart as a consequence of wars and events not of their making. In that sense, it has additional relevance.”\n\nHer husband Subin Subaiah, who wrote the script, said the play has largely remained true to the novel. “If aficionados feel their favourite parts are missing, it is a consequence of distilling the sprawling epic to an hour and 45 minutes of drama without an interval,” he said. “But we stayed true to the central characters and their journeys.”\n\nDirected by Daisy, the play, produced by her HuM Theatre and Esplanade, features a cast of established theatre practitioners, including herself (playing two roles) – Shrey Bhargava, Ashie Singh, Yogesh Tadwalkar, Aizuddiin Nasser, Gautam Marathe, Dipeeka, Jawahar Kankilal and Aditya Mazumdar.\n\nPartition is a sensitive issue that still rankles with many people in India and Pakistan. Subin said the story, however, has been played out without bias.\n\n“What is history is history,” he said. “We haven’t messed with that by making independent opinions that don’t resonate with the times and with Khushwant Singh’s sentiments.\n\n“When you read the interviews of the survivors, you notice that they speak without rancour about each other and are almost unanimous in their sentiment that such a tragedy should never happen again. I guess that speaks for itself as a matter of relevance.”\n\nAccording to Daisy, the story speaks to the audience in different ways. “It is a thriller, a historical drama and a romance,” she said.\n\n“If the audience goes away saying they had a good time at the theatre, that would be just dandy. If they contemplate on the material over dinner and find some kernels of contemporary relevance, that would be a bonus.”\n\nMazumdar, who plays a tea seller and ruffian, said the play “is a little homage to some of the sacrifices and bloodshed that we heard while growing up”.\n\n“My grandfather and his family lived in Karachi in the 1930s and moved to India sometime in the 1940s,” he said. “I grew up listening to stories from my aunts about their happy childhood and later some of the horror stories they saw their friends go through during the partition. This play sort of brings that all together.”\n\nMarathe, who acts as Iqbal, said Train To Pakistan is “a tale of that horrible time that everyone wants to forget and no one can”.\n\nHe added: “And no one should, as it contains lessons for all of us. It is a story that tells us that even when all the good intentions and hope fail in the face of extreme hatred, love can still inspire people to become heroes.”\n\nDaisy said the project was a complex one, but was a pleasure to bring to fruition thanks to a committed cast and crew.\n\n“HuM is a not-for-profit company and so I am delighted that we found support for this play from a few key  collaborators, patrons and sponsors,” she said. “Without their backing, this play could never have been staged.”\n\nThe Esplanade’s Kalaa Utsavam – Indian Festival of Arts 2024 runs from Nov 15 to 24 and celebrates Indian arts and culture during the festive period of Deepavali.

However, experts say this is far from extravagant, given the scale and complexity of these ventures.\n\nInstead, it highlights the cost-effectiveness that has become a hallmark of the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (Isro) approach, drawing global admiration for achieving high-impact results on a modest budget.\n\nIsro’s thrifty yet groundbreaking missions have often left the world astonished. Its Mars orbiter Mangalyaan cost just $98 million, while last year’s Chandrayaan-3 Moon mission required only $99 million – both significantly cheaper than Hollywood’s $133 million sci-fi thriller Gravity (2013).\n\nIn comparison, United States space agency Nasa’s Maven Mars orbiter cost $775 million, and Russia’s Luna-25, which crashed two days before Chandrayaan-3’s successful landing, cost $177 million.\n\nIndia’s economical achievements are rooted in a philosophy dating back to the 1960s, when Dr Vikram Sarabhai, the visionary behind Isro, convinced the government that a space programme could serve the needs of a young, resource-strapped India. His vision laid the groundwork for a programme that would do more with less – a principle that has fuelled Isro’s growth since.\n\nRetired civil servant Sisir Kumar Das, who managed Isro’s finances for more than 20 years, traces Isro’s lean ethos back to its inception. “In the 1960s, scientists worked with bicycles and bullock carts to transport rockets,” he told the BBC.\n\nDr Sarabhai had to convince the government that a space programme was not just a sophisticated luxury.\n\n“He explained that satellites could help India serve its citizens better,” Mr Das said.\n\nIndia’s space programme has long thrived on resourcefulness. Photographs from the early years show scientists transporting rockets on cycles. Today, Isro’s budget remains a fraction of Nasa’s with $2.06 billion allocated this year, compared to Nasa’s $33 billion.\n\nMr Das attributed Isro’s low costs to its reliance on indigenously developed technology, a strategy that emerged after international sanctions following India’s first nuclear test in 1974. This embargo spurred Indian scientists to create home-grown technology, avoiding the high costs of imports.\n\n“It was a blessing in disguise. Our scientists developed everything locally, which kept costs low and innovation high,” he said.\n\nDr Mylswamy Annadurai, who led India’s Moon and Mars missions, said Isro’s budget constraints often “force us to innovate”.\n\n“Our teams are small, dedicated and work extended hours without overtime because of their commitment,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/814b5634ae870883952693f5b82f014d84d53607f0f2bda532e06e97e9e7b321?w=825", "alt_text": "The Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023."}]}

The business sells imitation jewellery with unique designs, such as bangles with a Pongal pot imprint and Mahalakshmi jhumkas (earrings).\n\nWhile Ms Amutha can see if someone is in front, her vision is blurry at best, and she often can’t make out who the person is. To identify jewels, she has to bring them up close to her eye or take a zoomed-in photo and focus on it for a few seconds.\n\nSix years ago, Ms Amutha was driving when she suddenly sensed the lines on the road disappearing. Remarkably, she hadn’t known that she was blind in one eye for some years. A doctor revealed this to her when he diagnosed her with meningioma. A growing tumour in her optic nerve had already obstructed her right eye and was starting to block her left eye too.\n\nShe recalled how the doctor had asked her: “Your right eye has no vision. How did you live with it all this while?”\n\nAt the time, Ms Amutha was working at ST Logistics, a job she held since the age of 17. When she learnt of her eye condition, she transferred from an operations role to an administrative one.\n\n“I love driving big vehicles like lorries. But I had to tell my bosses that I could not drive or operate the forklift anymore. They downgraded me from executive operations to a procurement and admin role,” she told tabla!\n\n“But later, in my admin role, the tumour began to cover my left eye too. When I typed and sent quotations, I started mixing up digits. I couldn’t ask my boss to create another job for me. So I had to leave the company.”\n\nThe next six months were especially difficult for Ms Amutha, a divorcee with a 14-year-old son. “Staring at four walls every day, I felt like I was going crazy. I had to go out and interact with others,” she said.\n\nHaving always been interested in jewellery, she decided to turn her passion into a business. She contacted two ex-schoolmates – Ganga Uthiansoorian, 40, and Ranjni Kesavan, 41 – who agreed to help with the new venture.\n\nMs Amutha invested her savings into the business and used her connections in India to source for jewels.\n\nWhen she received the goods, her two friends acted as her “eyes”.\n\n“As her friend, we couldn’t leave her like this,” said Ms Ranjni. “She has many talents that can’t go to waste. When she pitched to us the idea for this business, we readily agreed to help.”\n\nWhenever they get time off from their full-time jobs, they head down to Ms Amutha’s home and help her to sell the jewellery on a livestream (via livestreams on Facebook and Instagram @regallifestylesg).\n\n“Initially, we would describe to her the jewellery’s shape, colour and properties. But over time, she was able to recognise them herself based on feel,” Ms Ranjni said.\n\n“It helps that she’s a fashionable person, paying attention to how her jewellery matches clothes, so she is able to understand what customers want.”\n\nMs Amutha’s hard work since April was rewarded when she was offered to set up a stall at the Indian Heritage Centre for Deepavali.\n\n“It was definitely a good start and there were many interested buyers. I’m doing this more to occupy myself than to make money,” said Ms Amutha.\n\n“Just as beautiful as it is, life is equally difficult. I want to show the world that it is possible to succeed despite all these challenges.”\n\n“I want to show the world that it is possible to succeed despite all these challenges.”\n\nMs Amutha Kulasekaran, who is visually impaired and runs a jewellery-making business.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/070ce0494d5460b29ec036927aa070216012a3cd198eec3418cb7725c522bffd?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Amutha Kulasekaran (right) with her friend Ganga Uthiansoorian, who helps her identify the jewels she works with."}]}

Vance and his wife Usha Vance, whose family hails from Andhra Pradesh, at an election night event in Florida on Nov 6. With Mr Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections, Ms Usha, 38, will become America’s Second Lady – the first Indian-American in that role.\n\nThe United States presidential election results evoked contrasting emotions in two villages in India: While residents of Thulasendrapuram in Tamil Nadu were disappointed by Ms Kamala Harris’ loss, those in Vadluru, Andhra Pradesh, celebrated Mr Donald Trump’s triumph along with his vice-presidential mate J.D. Vance.\n\nMs Kamala’s maternal family hails from Thulasendrapuram. On the other hand, Mr Vance’s wife Usha Chilukuri has roots in Vadluru.\n\nOn Nov 6, as the results began to pour in, people in both villages were glued to television screens checking the outcome. But the mood in one village began to dip as it became clear that Mr Trump would win.\n\nThulasendrapuram, teeming with people, gradually became deserted and returned to its usual state of quietude, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\n“We were hoping for her victory and had planned celebrations bigger than Deepavali,” said village leader J. Sudhakar. “We made arrangements to burst firecrackers, offer temple pujas and host a community lunch.\n\n“But success and failure are part of life. She is a fighter and will make a comeback.”\n\nWhile there was palpable disappointment in Thulasendrapuram, the mood was upbeat in Vadluru.\n\nFollowing Mr Trump and his vice-presidential mate J.D. Vance’s victory, people there celebrated – as Vadluru is the ancestral village of Mr Vance’s wife Usha Chilukuri.\n\nVadluru is about 3km from the town Tanuku in West Godavari district, where Ms Usha’s family once lived.\n\n“We celebrated Usha’s husband’s victory. We burst crackers and offered prayers at the local Sai Baba temple,” former village president P. Srinivasa Raju, 53, told PTI. Incidentally, the Sai Baba temple was constructed on a plot donated by Ms Usha’s family.\n\nPeople in Vadluru had offered prayers for a Trump win, and Hindu priest Appaji said he hoped Ms Usha would do something in return. “We expect her to help our village,” the 43-year-old priest said. “If she can recognise her roots and do something for this village, then that would be great.”\n\nAnother village leader Badri Narayana, 67, said Ms Usha’s family has a 70-year connection with Vadluru. He noted that her grandfather was a farmer there, though now only Ms Usha’s distant relatives live in the village. Ms Usha’s parents emigrated to the US in 1980.\n\nAccording to the Deccan Herald, Ms Usha’s great-grandfather moved out of Vadluru, and her father – a PhD holder – was brought up in Chennai, before heading to the US for higher studies.\n\nMs Usha, a practising Hindu who studied at Yale and Cambridge Universities, was born and brought up in San Diego. She met Mr Vance at Yale and married him in Kentucky in 2014. They have three children.\n\n“Every Indian feels proud of Usha,” said 70-year-old Venkata Ramanayya, a Vadluru resident. “She has never visited the village, but her father came around three years ago and checked on the temple’s condition.”\n\nWith the Trump-Vance victory on Nov 6, Ms Usha, 38, is set to become America’s Second Lady – the first Indian-American in that role.\n\nAndhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said, “it is a moment of pride for the Telugu community around the world”, adding that he is looking forward to inviting Mr Vance and Ms Usha to visit the state.\n\nVillagers from Vadluru, the ancestral home of America’s incumbent Second Lady, Ms Usha Vance, celebrating the election result.\n\nPhotos: AFP, REUTERS\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris reacts as she delivers remarks, conceding the 2024 U.S. presidential election to President-elect Donald Trump, at Howard University in Washington, U.S., November 6, 2024.\n\nPhoto: REUTERS\n\n“She is only 60 years old and we expect her to win the next election.

Watching those jets in action was amazing,” Avanish told tabla! “The tales shared by the pilots about their journeys around the world instilled in me a desire to pursue this path. I knew then that was the career I wanted.”\n\nWhile in secondary school, Avanish got involved with SYFC’s aeromodelling as a co-curricular activity. He enrolled in the SYFC flying course when he reached junior college.\n\nThe course is split into three phases. Phases I and II constitute the Basic Flying Course, while Phase III is the PPL Course and includes simulator sessions, CAAS ground papers and a final handling test. Courses are open to students who meet the selection criteria.\n\n“I started the flying course at 16. Balancing school and the course was challenging. I was deep into my A levels too, so finding time for everything was tough,” Avanish recalled. “Flying demands a lot of focus, so I had to be both mentally and physically ready, even when I was tired from school.”\n\nAvanish said he will never forget the excitement of flying solo for the first time. The moment arrived in June 2023.\n\n“It was the biggest moment of my life,” he said. “Having full control of the aircraft, navigating the skies for the first time without my instructor and landing safely was just amazing.”\n\nThe PPL course also changed his outlook and perspective on things. “Before, I was playful, easily distracted and a bit lazy at times. But training taught me essential skills like discipline, focus and time management.”\n\nHis next step, he said, is to enlist in the Republic of Singapore Air Force as soon as he finishes his A levels.\n\nSeeing Avanish make strides towards his goal of becoming a pilot has been a heartwarming sight for his father Sundararaju Anand.\n\nThe 48-year-old said: “Watching your child graduate from the Singapore Youth Flying Club is a proud moment for any parent.

Santosh Kumar\n\nOriginally it was meant to be a festival, a celebration of Indian classical artistes in different cities, in the vein of the dance programme that Akram Khan, along with Malaysian dancer Mavin Khoo, curated for London’s Darbar Festival in 2017-19.\n\nBut, when it came to putting GIGENIS – The Generation Of The Earth together, British choreographer Akram, who is internationally renowned for his invigorating blend of the classical Kathak tradition and contemporary dance, realised he wanted more.\n\n“Classical Indian dance is very much my home and I hadn’t choreographed for a group of dancers entirely steeped in that tradition,” he told tabla! “I thought: ‘Why don’t I explore my own language?’, while combining it with contemporary dance.”\n\nThe 50-year-old, who is of Bangladeshi descent, came out of retirement to bring six esteemed Indian classical dancers – kutiyattam artiste Kapila Venu; odissi soloist Sirikalyani Adkoli; and bharatanatyam exponents Khoo, Mythili Prakash and partners in life Renjith and Vijna Vasudevan – and himself onto the stage for a world tour that’s the first of its kind.\n\nThe work, which premiered in Aix-en-Provence, France, in August, is travelling to seven cities, with Singapore the second and only Asian stop.\n\nIt will be staged at the Esplanade Theatre on Nov 15 and 16 as one of the highlights of Kalaa Utsavam – Indian Festival of Arts 2024.\n\n“We are in an era where our minds often insist that we must see something to believe it,” said Akram.\n\n“But in the traditional classical forms that shaped my upbringing, it was through belief that we could truly see. The work is a celebration of that wisdom, and honours the culture that continues to guide my artistic journey.”\n\nAccording to the double Olivier Award (highest honour in British theatre) winner, who choreographed the London Olympics’ opening ceremony, GIGENIS is inspired by the Mahabharata – but it is not a story from the Indian epic.\n\nIt is about a mother of two sons who has lost her husband to war. And towards the end of her life, when one of her son dies in battle, she reflects on how this all came to be.\n\nHow she saw the world when she was a child, how she saw the world when she married, how she saw the world when she gave birth, and finally, how she sees the world when she experiences the death of her son.\n\n“I find myself continuously returning back to this tale since performing in Peter Brook’s Mahabharata over 35 years ago,” said Akram, who choreographed a section of Australian singer Kylie Minogue’s Showgirl tour in 2005. “GIGENIS is a kind of metaphor of how I feel about the world today.”\n\nGigenis in Greek means giant or titan. It derives from Greek mythology and is used to describe something of significance.\n\n“It references the powerful themes of greed, loss, joy and fear as seen in the Mahabharata,” said Akram.\n\n“’The Generation Of The Earth’ serves as a bridge between the past and the present moment and is reflective of the ongoing relevance and impact of these ancient narratives on present and future generations.”\n\nFor fans of Akram’s breathless dancing, it has been a long wait to see him in action again. For the dancer, being back on stage in a new role is “incredibly humbling”.\n\n“I’m not just a dancer but a director, guiding six extraordinary soloists from different generations and discipline: kathak, odissi, bharatanatyam and kutiyattam,” he said.\n\n“While I continue to honour the tradition of my form, Kathak, my role as a storyteller has evolved.

Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nDashing into the sheltered enclosure in front of Hillion Mall with several packets of piping hot biryani in tow, Mr Navin Prasath stops to make sure the curry packets in his carrier bag aren’t leaking.\n\nHe is one of many who braved the rain for the past half an hour to queue for arguably the most coveted of food items at a pasar malam (night market) in front of the shopping centre located in Bukit Panjang.\n\n“This biryani is worth it,” he tells me. “Granted, we don’t have many good biryani stalls in this area, but when these guys set up a stall here, it’s almost always sold out within one-two hours.”\n\n“These guys” refer to Ajmir Biryani, or more specifically, the three brothers who run the business renowned for Indian snacks and sweets.\n\nAjmir’s flagship store – or stall, rather – is located at an overhead bridge just outside Admiralty MRT station. The outlet sells primarily sweets and murukku and the like – but every year, during the month of Ramadan, it also offers its much-loved biryani.\n\n“The biryani thing started in 2012, by our father (who created and ran the Ajmir business),” Ajmir’s director Mohamed Ismail says.\n\n“He had a lot of interest in cooking and loved experimenting with recipes, but his career took a different path despite his passion. I even asked him: ‘We already have a good business going, why do this?’ But he wanted to try making and selling biryani as a side business.\n\n“At the time, fasting month was approaching, so we sold the biryani on a very small scale; like 5kg of mutton, which made about 20-30 packets.”\n\nThe response from customers grew favourable rather quickly, and a few days into the venture, 5kg became 10kg.\n\nMr Ismail’s father died months after that Ramadan, at the age of 59, but the family decided to continue selling biryani not just as a remembrance to him – but also by popular demand.\n\nInitially, it was just once a year during fasting month, but in 2018, the brothers – which includes Mr Faizal and Mr Sabrudeen – set up a delivery business just for biryani.\n\nThe online business runs only from Friday to Sunday, and for lunch on public holidays. Ever so often, though, Ajmir also runs a stall at various ad hoc night markets islandwide.\n\nAt these pop-up outlets, such as the one at Hillion Mall last month, the biryani often sells out before lunch time.\n\nWhen the rain ceased at around 2pm, workers arrived just in time with a fresh batch from another pasar malam stall in Tampines.\n\n“Whenever we run out at one stall, we’ll replenish the biryani by taking it from another stall,” said Mr Faizal, who similar to his two brothers, is in his thirties.\n\n“Wherever there’s a pasar malam and we get invited to set up shop, we will go. But our focus is still on our online delivery; even now, our online presence is better than our pop-up outlets.”\n\nIntrigued by the dish’s popularity, I gave the mutton biryani a go, and understood the hype almost immediately.\n\nWhile the rice is decent, the masala is everything in Ajmir’s biryani – spicy, but not overly so, and crucially, without too many cardamom seeds sneaking into every scoop of rice.\n\nIt’s a highly tasty biryani; one of the few versions in Singapore that you don’t need a dollop of acha (pickles) as an accompaniment.\n\nIn addition to chicken and mutton, Ajmir also sells – on certain days – prawn, lamb shank and even ayam masak merah (red gravy chicken) biryani.\n\n“After our dad passed, we worked on the recipe and tried improving it along the way. My mum gave her input and later so did my wife and mother-in-law,” said Mr Ismail.\n\n“Until this day, I think the recipe can still be improved. It’s always evolving actually. And (the taste) is a lot different from when we started.”\n\nThe masala is all that matters when it comes to Ajmir Biryani.\n\nPhotos: T.

In 2022, 13 tigers were reported missing, but it happened over a three-year period, between January 2019 and January 2022.\n\nThe high number of missing cats has triggered panic in Rajasthan, with Mr Upadhyay constituting a three-member committee to investigate the incident.\n\n“The idea is to fix the system so that we know why these tigers are missing, and we’re aware of what changes to make so it doesn’t recur. Missing tigers isn’t a good thing,” he told ThePrint.\n\nHowever, RNP field director K.R. Anoop felt the the word “missing” is a misnomer.\n\n“Just because the big cats haven’t been detected – either through camera traps or pug marks – doesn’t mean that they are missing,” he said. “Tigers live and die, it’s part of their natural cycle. The focus should be on the overall number of tigers in the reserve, rather than on ‘missing tigers’ and blaming the forest department for mismanagement.”\n\nSpread over 400 sq km, the RNP, near Sawai Madhopur town, had 88 tigers in 2023. According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority data, four deaths were reported this year, and three in 2023.\n\nOn Nov 4, villagers killed another tiger after it was blamed for the death of a shepherd.\n\n“Tigers engage in territorial fights, some are in deep interiors of the forests and perish there. We can’t keep track of every tiger,” said Mr Anoop, explaining that the forest department’s daily patrolling activities are restricted to paths and tracks.\n\nThere have been cases of Ranthambore tigers moving to the nearby Dholpur-Karauli Tiger Reserve. There has also been at least one tiger that went missing from Ranthambore and turning up in Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park in 2013, It was returned to Ranthambore in 2022.\n\n“In a scavenger-heavy forest, it is entirely possible that a tiger dies and its carcass is eaten within two weeks without the forest department finding out,” said Mr Anoop.\n\nAuthor and conservation biologist with the Ranthambore-based NGO Tiger Watch Dharmendra Khandal said it is possible that some tigers died during retaliatory attacks by villagers, either by poisoning or other methods.\n\n“Two tigers have been killed in the last year or so due to this reason, but the number could be a lot higher,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5fa7c89d75bf1acde652adfb6d7e79b863e21cf6ab2f48db14953461214d6d36?w=825", "alt_text": "A tiger at Ranthambore National Park."}]}

It’s also about creating a family filled with love, laughter and joy.\n\n“I was hesitant at first, worried about managing three children together,” admitted Ms Anjelan. “But, when I thought about the little one waiting in the hospital for a loving home, I knew I had to act.”\n\nWith support from Mr David and their biological daughter, the family welcomed the second foster child into their home shortly after Christmas last year.\n\nThey had been planning an overseas holiday when they received a call from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) about a child being available for fostering.\n\nIt was no small decision, so they took some time to think it through, before shelving the holiday plan and proceeding with the fostering offer.\n\nThe couple came to know about fostering when they visited Mr David’s aunt and observed a happy family with two biological and six foster children. It left a lasting impression on Ms Anjelan, Asia-Pacific head of global immigrations at an IT company.\n\nFostered children usually leave their families due to safety concerns. It is a temporary care arrangement and they return to their biological families when they are older and better able to fend for themselves.\n\nMs Anjelan decided she wanted to have a family that included foster children when it became clear that her husband and her were unlikely to have a second biological child of their own.\n\nShe shared her plan with her husband and their biological daughter, who was 10 at the time. Together, they decided to apply for a foster child.\n\nAfter an 11-month wait, they received the call on Aug 5, 2022 that changed their lives – a baby girl, just two weeks old, was in need of a foster home.\n\n“We were overjoyed,” Ms Anjelan,42, recalled.\n\nAs they prepared for the new arrival, they bought all the essentials online, from feeding bottles to a pram and a baby car seat.\n\nThey also had to go through a three-month learning journey on how to take care of a new born.\n\nExplained Ms Anjelan: “It had been some time since the birth of our daughter, so the training was useful.”\n\nWith the guidance of hospital staff and MSF officers, they navigated the ups and downs of caring for the baby.\n\n“It was a steep learning curve, but we were determined to give our foster child the best possible start,” said Ms Anjelan.\n\n“The support we received from the hospital and MSF was invaluable – the people were kind, patient and always available to offer advice and reassurance.”\n\nWhen the big day arrived, Mr David, a safety, health and environment engineer in a pharmaceutical company, was restless at work, eager to rush home to pick up the baby for the first time.\n\nTheir first Christmas with their first foster child in 2022 was a memorable one, filled with laughter, love and gifts from friends and family. But little did they know that their family was about to grow again.\n\nAlmost 14 months later, they received another call – a 15-month-old baby boy was in need of a foster home.\n\nMs Anjelan immediately asked: “What if I don’t accept?” The response was heartbreaking – the child would remain in the hospital until a suitable home was found.\n\nThat’s when she decided to welcome the new foster child into their family.\n\nWhen they first met the new child, something remarkable happened. The first foster child grabbed the new baby and tried to bond.\n\nAs Ms Anjelan watched the heartwarming scene, her eyes welled up with tears. In that moment, she felt a deep sense of pride and gratitude, realising that her children were teaching her and Mr David invaluable lessons about love, acceptance and family.\n\nToday, the couple and their three kids are a happy family. Their home, a five-room HDB flat, is always filled with laughter and fun. Sometimes, it gets a little crazy with three young children.\n\nLast week, as they prepared to celebrate Christmas together, Ms Anjelan reflected on their journey.\n\n“I dream of having a huge space one day, where I can foster as many children as possible,” she said, her eyes shining with determination.\n\nMr David, 46, chimed in: “With three kids, every day feels like a celebration.

There, she would steal jewellery and cash and flee.\n\nAccording to the police, the gang got away with six such heists, before they were caught last weekend.\n\nVimalesh, the police said, targeted one Shankar Upadhyay, who was looking for a bride.\n\nVimalesh took Rs150,000 ($2,395) from the man and introduced him to Poonam.\n\nThen at the court, where Mr Upadhyay and Poonam were to marry, Vimalesh demanded another Rs150,000 from Mr Upadhyay for the marriage process to be completed.\n\nThat’s when Mr Upadhyay smelt a rat. He asked for the identity cards of Poonam and Sanjana, who posed as Poonam’s mother.\n\n“I suspected from their behaviour that they were trying to con me,” Mr Upadhyay told NDTV. “When I refused to marry, they threatened to get me killed and frame me in false cases. I said I needed time to think and left.”\n\nMr Upadhyay immediately contacted the police in Banda who launched an investigation.\n\nAdditional Police Superintendent Shiv Raj told NDTV that the two women and two men were later arrested.\n\nDuring interrogation, they revealed that they had conned six other men before.\n\nIn Jaipur, a woman, described by the police as “Looteri Dulhan” or looting bride, has been arrested after she married a series of men and collected a total of Rs1.25 crore ($200,00) from them as settlement.\n\nPolice in the Rajasthan city said they arrested the 36-year-old woman after a jeweller filed a case in July 2023 reporting that his “wife” had disappeared with jewellery worth Rs30 lakh, Rs6.5 lakh in cash and other valuables just months after their February wedding.\n\nAccording to Deputy Commissioner of Police Amit Kumar, the jeweller, a widower, said he met Seema Agarwal on a matrimonial app and they married at a ceremony in Mansarovar.\n\nHowever, in July, she vanished with the family’s valuables.\n\nPolice investigations revealed that Seema, a woman from Dehradun in Uttarakhand, targeted wealthy men through matrimonial apps, luring them into marriage before looting them and filing false legal cases against them,\n\nA special team from Murlipura police station in Jaipur tracked Seema to her residence in Dehradun and arrested her. Her questioning revealed a pattern of similar crimes stretching over a decade.\n\nIn 2013, she married a businessman’s son in Agra and allegedly extorted Rs75 lakh by filing a domestic abuse case shortly after the wedding.\n\nIn 2017, she allegedly targeted a software engineer in Gurugram, filing allegations of unnatural sex and rape against his cousin and extorting Rs10 lakh.\n\nPolice investigation revealed that Seema looked for her victims on matrimonial sites, usually settling for men who were either divorced or had lost their wives.\n\nBy marrying in different states, she collected a total of Rs1.25 crore as settlement in various cases.\n\nPoonam Mishra has been arrested with three others, police said.\n\nPhoto: X", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/968af39b2dc960aac51753c42e4825f529621867fffa4fb90436094395b8b0e9?w=825", "alt_text": "Seema Agarwal after her arrest by Jaipur Police."}]}

The fighting there was sparked last year by a court order that proposed giving the Meiteis, who live in the prosperous Imphal valley region of the state, the same government benefits as those given to historically disadvantaged Kukis, who live in the more-impoverished hills.\n\nSecurity forces have manned a buffer zone between the two groups to try to limit the violence.\n\nThe state has a history of insurgencies and in recent decades many militants fled across the porous border following military crackdowns.\n\nSecurity officers said Meitei groups have been fighting on the side of the ruling junta in Myanmar’s civil war and an estimated 2,000 of their cadres had been camping in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, just across the border from Manipur, as of December.\n\nThey have fought anti-junta rebels like the People’s Defence Force-Kalay (PDF-K) and the Kuki National Army-Burma in Sagaing, Kachin and Chin areas of northern Myanmar, Indian security officers and tribal leaders said.\n\nThe Kukis, meanwhile, have support from the Kachin rebels and have bought weapons from Myanmar’s semi-autonomous Wa state, according to three Indian officers, several tribal leaders and a PDF-K source in Myanmar.\n\nSome Meitei groups had operated from camps within Myanmar with the support of the military, but were now scattered along the frontier and going back into Manipur, said Mr Sui Khar, vice chairman of the rebel Chin National Front, an anti-junta rebel outfit that operates in Chin state.\n\n“They closely collaborated with the Burmese army in operations against us,” he told Reuters in a telephone call.\n\nThe Indian military and police officers said it was difficult to assess the number of militants who have returned to Manipur.\n\nBut more than 100 Meitei insurgents, including some intercepted by Indian authorities at the Myanmar border, were arrested in Manipur last year and more than 200 this year, according to a security officer and government data reviewed by Reuters.\n\nAbout 50 Kuki insurgents were arrested in the same period, the data shows.\n\n“Manipur was a problem, and now you have the Myanmar problem also coming in,” Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said in October. “The battle lines are getting hardened”.\n\nIn February, India announced plans to fence its 1,600km border with Myanmar.\n\nRival fighters are now equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, sniper and assault rifles, including foreign-made M16s, M4A1s and AK-47s, according to seizure announcements by the military and the Manipur police.\n\nWhile many of the weapons being used in Manipur were looted from state armouries in the initial months of the conflict, the more sophisticated weapons were brought in from Myanmar mostly this year, the officers said.\n\n“These are two distinct conflicts, one for freedom from military rule, and another an internal ethnic conflict largely inflicted by one side on another,” said Mr Gautam Mukhopadhaya, India’s ambassador to Myanmar between 2013 and 2016.\n\n“With raging conflicts going on side by side, it can be assumed that some weapons transfers and trade in arms takes place.”\n\nAbout 1,500 illegally imported arms are estimated to be in Manipur’s Meitei-dominated valley area, and about 2,000 in the hills where most Kukis live, the Indian officers said, based on details from arrested insurgents.\n\nThese arms are in addition to about 5,000 government weapons that were stolen by Meitei groups, and about 1,000 by Kukis, the officers said.\n\nAuthorities have since recovered 3,000 weapons, including around 2,000 of those stolen, Manipur government officials told media in November.\n\nBesides extortion, the security officers said some of the funding for the arms comes from illegal poppy plantations, which the state government has attempted to curb in recent years.\n\n“Poppy farms are in the hills, but processing also happens in the valley, and we have seen that field labour can be from any community, protected by armed men,” said Mr Homen Thangjam, a political science professor at the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University.\n\n“Who pays them to grow is a mystery.”\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/489daef829869a2755c9c3fb80b0b836a443c0b939f6dcdc6d0c57515b397b1b?w=825", "alt_text": "A woman protesting at an army checkpoint on Nov 30 after a man from the Meitei community went missing in Imphal."}]}

That’s why we welcome carolers. It gives us fulfilment and increases bonding among church members.”\n\nMr James, who has been a caroler since young, knows the amount of dedication it takes to go from house to house and sing. He ensures that the carolers are well fed.\n\nChristmas caroling, an age-old tradition, has transcended generations at the Ang Mo Kio Tamil Methodist Church. Today, even people as young as 12-year-old Raja Raemon Vasanthan are involved.\n\nThe boy said it provided him with an opportunity to learn a new instrument – the cajon (a box-shaped percussion instrument originally from Peru which is played by slapping the front or rear faces with the hands).\n\n“When I joined the caroling group with my family, many asked me if I could play the cajon,” said Raja. “So I learnt the cajon by myself, and now I am playing it.”\n\nCaroling also gave Rameshbabu Ramya, 17, an opportunity to come out of her shell.\n\n“At church, normally, we don’t speak much,” she said. “But, in a more informal and fun setting like caroling, I am able to make new friends.”\n\nAlso on Dec 20, a group of 25 carolers from the Life Centre Church in Yishun visited different houses, as part of their three-day session. It included singing at 91-year-old pastor Rita Abeysekera’s house where they were greeted with warm hugs.\n\nFirst-time caroler Sherrin, 36, enjoyed the occasion as she carried her one-year-old child Shira Daniela with her.\n\n“I’m really happy,” said Sherrin. “It’s the first Christmas carol for both of us. That makes it really special.”\n\nAnusha Selvamani and Ravi Singaram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2a661143ae4619a08686916d104e3aea7a90e2a2fbbd384dae98ab68e931ca88?w=825", "alt_text": "Carolers from Ang Mo Kio Tamil Methodist Church."}]}

Her father Vijayamohan Subramaniam, a 65-year-old retired policeman with diabetes, had set the climb as his birthday goal last May.\n\nThe group – father, daughter, her husband and a family friend – spent four months meticulously preparing for it. They researched the route, climbed stairs daily, did weight training and practised breathing techniques to adapt to the oxygen-scarce altitudes.\n\nThe trek spanned 12 days, with an average of 10 hours a day spent walking. The day before reaching the base camp was the most harrowing – when a blizzard turned their path into an indistinguishable white sheet.\n\n“I couldn’t see anything,” Ms Shuba recalled. “It was just us, walking forward. It was nothing like I ever experienced. You need to prepare yourself for unpredictable weather, high altitudes, and the fact that there’s no guarantee you’ll even make it to the base camp.”\n\nHer experience wasn’t unlike that of Ms Sindujah Nair, 21, this year.\n\nLow oxygen levels at the high altitude made her almost quit her goal of reaching the base camp.\n\nShe set out to accomplish her climb for personal reasons. She lost her uncle in a tragic motorbike accident in 2023, and decided to honour his memory by fulfilling his own dream of completing the famed trek.\n\nHaving climbed smaller peaks like Mt Ophir in Malaysia and Mt Batur in Indonesia, Ms Sindujah, a financial consultant, left no stone unturned for her Everest mission.\n\nShe spent six months training rigorously – running, weight lifting, hiking up Bukit Timah Hill, taking stairs instead of lifts – to build her endurance. But nothing could prepare her for the bone-chilling cold of the Nepal mountains, which plummeted to -2 deg C in addition to dangerously low oxygen levels.\n\nAt the halfway point of her climb, Ms Sindujah feared she would be sent back down the mountain, like many other climbers struggling with altitude sickness. Somehow, she said, she found the strength to continue.\n\n“When summit day arrived, it demanded everything I had – gruelling hours of climbing steep craters, each step feeling like a battle. It was the hardest day of my life,” she said.\n\n“And when I reached the summit, I was simply in tears. I had done something extraordinary, and I honoured my uncle. It was a very emotional moment.”\n\nMs Sindujah Nair.\n\nPhoto: Sindujah", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8edea6258efa7e3c0dad62e4a839861068478a5fe409be5c8ea374b9acf66a5a?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Shubashini Vijayamohan (extreme left) at the Everest Base Camp."}]}

The visit included a week-long exploration of two of India’s most vibrant cities – capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai – as well as a visit to Agra, known for its romantic symbol Taj Mahal.\n\nMost of the participating journalists, representing Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines, were on their first visit to India. I have been to the south, but it was the first time I visited north India.\n\nSo, the journey was an adventure in itself. Over seven days, we immersed ourselves in the country’s rich and diverse culture, forging meaningful interactions with locals and experiencing the true essence of India.\n\nAt the heart of India’s democracy – in Delhi – we met and interacted with the respective secretaries of the Ministry of External affairs (MEA), Department of Commerce and the Department of Science and Technology.\n\nI had read about the MEA’s Mr Jaideep Mazumdar, secretary (east), and Mr Randhir Jaiswal, official spokesperson. But meeting them in their office and asking them questions was an entirely new experience for me. It was heartening to hear that they hold ASEAN as a valuable trading partner.\n\nThe visit to Asian News International (ANI), one of the leading multimedia news organisations in India, and witnessing journalists working in a busy newsroom provided a shared perspective on the opportunities and challenges facing the media industry in general.\n\nWe also went to the headquarters of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) located in Gurugram, near Delhi. A collaboration between India and France, ISA was formed in 2015 to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions.\n\nIt was heartening to hear first-hand from its director-general Ajay Mathur on how the alliance is looking up to the efforts of Singapore in spearheading solar energy transformation to generate electricity.\n\nOne of the programme’s highlights was a visit to the iconic Taj Mahal. As I approached the towering white marble mausoleum, my heart raced with a mix of anticipation and reverence. Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer scale and grandeur of the Taj, or the profound sense of wonder that overwhelmed me as I stepped into its serene gardens.\n\nIn Mumbai, we explored the Elephanta Caves on Elephanta Island, which is home to ancient Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. Announced as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, the caves provided an unforgettable sight into India’s spiritual and cultural history.\n\nI also got a taste of Bollywood, as we visited one of India’s largest film studio complexes, The Mumbai Film City, or Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari, established in 1977. There, we explored the behind-the-scenes workings of India’s flourishing film industry.\n\nWe further explored key developments shaping India’s modern economy, such as the BSE (formerly known as Bombay Stock Exchange), the Mazagaon Dock and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which oversees the country’s retail payment systems.\n\nNPCI handles more than 17 billion financial transactions monthly. It blew my mind how far India has come in terms of adopting real-time payments and cashless transactions. Indian banks are shutting down more ATMs despite record-high cash circulation. This trend is attributed to the rise of digital transactions and UPI payments.\n\nThe ASEAN-India Media Exchange Programme, organised annually by the MEA, aims to strengthen media cooperation, promote multi-faceted interaction and build capacity in the region through information sharing.

Santosh Kumar\n\nGrowing up in his village Buana Lakhu, in Haryana’s Panipat district, Navdeep Singh faced taunts from kids and adults, who called him “Bauna” (dwarf).\n\nBorn prematurely in 2000, he appeared to be growing up normally in the beginning. But, when he was two years old, his parents realised he had dwarfism. From then on life became a struggle for him.\n\n“I would avoid leaving home for days,” he told tabla! during a recent visit to Singapore. “The taunts were pretty bad. It would have put down anybody growing up.\n\n“But my dad Dalbir Singh, a national-level wrestler, backed me totally. He kept motivating me to do well in sports. He saw me as an extension of his own aspirations and pushed me into taking up wrestling. I soon realised it was a way to grow in stature.”\n\nHowever, Navdeep gave up Haryana’s traditional sport by age 16, taking up sprinting instead.\n\n“My height would not allow me to become a good sprinter,” he said. “There were also medical issues, as my heart is small-sized. So, I switched to shot put and then javelin, inspired by national icon Neeraj Chopra.\n\n“Then, through sheer hard work and discipline, I set out to achieve what I wanted to be – make people back home remember me differently, not as someone who is short but as a champion para-athlete.”\n\nOn Sept 7, at the 2024 Paris Paralympics, Navdeep, who stands at 1.32m, came up with the throw of his lifetime to claim a historic gold medal for India.\n\nHis personal best of 47.32 metres was the country’s first-ever top podium finish in the men’s javelin F41 category.\n\nNavdeep had originally won the silver medal but, in a dramatic turn of events, he was upgraded after Iran’s Beit Sayah Sadegh was disqualified for “unsporting and improper conduct” – repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag.\n\n“Initially, my dwarfism felt like a burden,” said Navdeep. “I wondered why I couldn’t enjoy life like others – go to school and have fun. But then I understood fate had dealt me a heavy blow and I have to overcome it. I ignored all the taunts and negative comments and focused on what I wanted to achieve. It was single-minded dedication that made me a champion with the support of my dad, coach, family and government.”\n\nIndia had a record 29 medal winners at the Paris Paralympics. But it was Navdeep who melted all the hearts with his simple gesture during a meet-and-greet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHe gifted Mr Modi a blue cap and asked for his autograph, and in response, the prime minister sat down on the floor to accept the gift.\n\nThe scene resonated with many, showing how respectful Mr Modi is towards athletes like Navdeep, who have achieved remarkable feats despite all odds.\n\nThe Paris win was indeed a defining moment for Navdeep, who silenced all his doubters. Having turned those taunts into his biggest triumph on sport’s grandest stage, he expressed his concerns over the indignities heaped upon people whose bodies don’t fit the usual moulds, and demanded “the same respect” for them.\n\nThe 23-year-old said: “My aim is to educate society that we also exist in this world and nobody should make fun of us. We also can make our country proud.”\n\nNavdeep trained tirelessly in the run-up to the Paris Paralympics –  honing his skills and refining his technique at the Sports Authority of India centres in Bengaluru and Gandhinagar. He had faced setbacks previously, finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago and Asian Para Games last year and third at the World Para Athletics Championship earlier this year.\n\n“I suffered a lot,” he said. “I heard people say things like, ‘He can’t do this, he only performs well in India, but fails in competition’. But I just ignored all of it. I knew I had to unleash my best throw on September 7, and I did that and won.”\n\nNavdeep credited Olympic Gold Quest, a not for profit company founded by sporting legends Geet Sethi and Prakash Padukone to support Indian athletes in winning Olympic gold medals, for funding and supporting his journey.\n\nHe had spent years away from home, often making do with basic meals.\n\n“It was a struggle for six years (2017-2024). I stayed away from my home, eating whatever was available,” said Navdeep. “But, in the end, all the sacrifices paid off.”\n\nNavdeep next aims to win gold medals at the upcoming Para World Championships and Para Asian Games, for which he has already started training under coach Sunil Tanwar from Haryana.\n\n“I started with a throw of 11 metres and now have reached 47 – I never thought that would be possible,” said Navdeep.” The performance in Paris was better than what I expected. I will work harder from now on and will try to win more gold medals for India.”\n\n“It was single-minded dedication that made me a champion with the support of my dad, coach, family and government.”\n\nNavdeep Singh", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/08c9e218a9d8a4a6123df97be7a13e68c33c32507d8976abd476c903f3428aef?w=825", "alt_text": "Navdeep Singh in action at the 2024 Paris Paralympics."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTop Indian chef Sanjeev Kapoor (right) brings diversity and unforgettable taste to the table up in the skies, on Singapore Airlines long haul flights.\n\n“The menu has to pass the taste test,” said Kapoor.\n\n“The dishes are taken into a simulated pressurised cabin, and hours are spent sampling and adjusting the flavours, so the food can taste its best at 35,000 feet.”\n\nKapoor, 60, is a member of SIA’s International Culinary Panel, a talented pool that comprises five globally acclaimed chefs.\n\nThe others are Georges Blanc (France), Matt Moran (Australia), Yoshihiro Murata (Japan) and Zhu Jun (China).\n\nKapoor has been tasked with providing a wholesome meal with a comforting Indian touch. Passengers can choose from vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies.\n\nAnd, if they are travelling in First Class or Business Class, they get to taste Kapoor’s signature Shahi Thali and Ruchi Thali respectively.\n\nAvailable in vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, each thali is a culinary journey from India’s north to south, presenting regional flavours in their truest form.\n\nKapoor was recently in Singapore as the brand ambassador for The Akshaya Patra Foundation – a not-for-profit organisation headquartered in Bengaluru that strives to eliminate classroom hunger by providing nutritious meals to children studying in government schools and government-aided schools.\n\nHe told tabla! that he considers “multiple things” before curating SIA’s in-flight food experience.\n\n“The philosophy centres on dishes that transmit freshness,” he said. “Over time, we have understood what works and what doesn’t. For instance, slow-cooked dishes with flavours that are not understated work well.\n\n“The air is drier in the cabin, and you need water for dispersion of flavour. You even salivate less on a flight. So, we have to compensate for the lack of water. Also, the food is cooked in the kitchen and chilled – to be reheated on the flight. So it can never be overcooked in the kitchen.\n\n“Gravies are good as they inherently have moisture that prevents the food from drying up. Indian food is lucky that way. Food items that change form with freezing and reheating, or those that need very high temperatures to reheat, cannot be used.”\n\nMost ingredients tend to become dry, rubbery, limp or change colour when they are reheated. For instance, leafy greens like spinach won’t retain their bright green colour, prawns might get chewy and deep-fried food like potato chips will not remain crisp.\n\n“So, the food will have to be seasoned more than usual in order to heighten flavours and aromas, which will compensate for the 30 per cent reduction in taste sensations,” said Kapoor. “But you also need to take into account that you are serving different kinds of flavours in an enclosed space. This means you would not, ideally, want the cabin to overwhelmingly smell of any particular food item.”\n\nThe chef, the only one in India to have his own channel – FoodFood, also designs the menus keeping in mind flight routes and timings.\n\n“Singapore Airlines conducted research some years ago in the Indian cities to which it operates to find out what fliers prefer to eat,” he said. “We learnt that when people are going away from their homes – on a holiday or business trip – they prefer more elaborate meals that are reminiscent of restaurant food. However, when they are returning home, they prefer home-style cooking.”\n\nWith this piece of information, Kapoor designed the Shahi Thali which is part of SIA’s First Class dining on Indian routes.\n\nTypically it will have items such as coconut-ginger pancake with lemongrass infused prawn, mango chaat with tomato olive and coriander chutney, murgh tulsi malai, til wala pulao, chicken in basil cream,  Rajasthani lamb with chilli, spinach with fenugreek, black pepper lentil soup, kachumber salad, yogurt and white pumpkin rice pudding with milk and stewed fruits.\n\nOften, he relies on feedback and booking requests to understand what passengers want to eat.\n\n“Passengers, especially on long-haul flights, often fill in their dietary preferences while booking their flights. This makes it easier for me to decide on the dishes we plan to serve on a specific flight,” said Kapoor. “Flight routes and timings also decide what meal  – breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack – is  served. Our menu is also selected to meet the needs of passengers who may be travelling through multiple time zones.”\n\nKapoor pointed out that it is not easy serving Indian dishes on flights.\n\n“For airlines, weight is everything,” he said. “We even had to do research on the clay pot in which the curd is served so that it does not add significantly to the total weight of the dish.\n\n“Crockery has to look good but it cannot weigh a lot. There is also very little space for the crew to stand and do their duties. So, if there are many steps involved in serving, it will be frustrating for them, and the flyers will get impatient as it will take more time.”\n\nTraining catering and cabin crew members in presentation is equally important.\n\n“Photographs of each dish are given to staff members so that they know exactly how the food should look and how it is to be served,” said Kapoor. “We also have to keep in mind that there are limitations when it comes to the use of cutlery and space, both while serving and eating.”\n\nOn SIA flights, the Indian cuisine is available in Business Class, First Class and Economy Class.\n\n“Over a period of time, I think the quality of the Economy Class food has improved,” said Kapoor. “There is also more to eat – as we change the menu almost every three to six months.\n\n“The airline also pays a lot of attention to the profile of the traveller. A lot of people transit in Singapore on their way to India from Australia, United States and other places. So, we are catering to a very typical Indian traveller going home.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/afe0bcbf577f095049d0f1cbd2cc9e24fde0e1c2e12934a51c436ff738e09532?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

On this scale, a pH value of 7 is neutral, which means it is neither acidic nor basic. A pH value of less than 7 means it is more acidic, and a pH value of more than 7 means it is more basic.\n\nAn acidic environment can result from dietary habits (high in processed foods, sugar and animal proteins), chronic stress or certain medical conditions.\n\nWhile the body has mechanisms to maintain balance, prolonged acidity can strain systems like the kidneys and lungs, potentially leading to fatigue, inflammation or poor immunity.\n\nThough mild acidity is not always immediately alarming, persistent imbalance may contribute to chronic conditions over time.\n\nAn overly acidic body can disrupt cellular energy production, leaving you feeling tired and drained.\n\nSymptoms like acid reflux, bloating or heartburn indicate an acidic internal environment. Overproduction of stomach acid and poor digestion are common in those consuming an acidic diet, disrupting gastrointestinal health over time.\n\nAcidic conditions may deplete minerals like magnesium, calcium and potassium, essential for muscle function. This can lead to muscle pain, weakness, or frequent cramps, especially during or after physical activity.\n\nAcidity can promote inflammation in the joints, exacerbating conditions like arthritis or causing stiffness and discomfort. Over time, an acidic environment may contribute to cartilage breakdown and chronic joint pain.\n\nPersistent acidity can manifest as acne, dryness or rashes. Acidic imbalance can lead to reduced oxygenation and blood flow to the brain, causing headaches or migraines. Dehydration, often associated with acidity, can worsen these symptoms.\n\nAcidity can deplete essential nutrients, weakening hair and nails over time. This may result in hair thinning, breakage, or slow growth, while nails become brittle, discoloured, or prone to cracking.\n\nAddressing these signs with an alkaline-focused diet, adequate hydration and stress management can help restore balance and improve overall health.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/78d9b477757364e2f989685a2e88005d95edc880395e379ed0c08212fff6ddb2?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Of the country’s 1,796 cinema releases last year, just 218 were Bollywood’s traditional fare of Hindi-language movies, EY said.\n\nPhotographers now snap more candid images of celebrity daily lives, often more relatable to millions of fans than red carpet glamour or formal magazine shoots.\n\nDespite their careers being more closely linked, old frictions remain, especially for big-name stars.\n\nLast year, Bollywood star Alia Bhatt made a police complaint for “gross invasion” of privacy after two photographers took pictures of her at home from a neighbouring rooftop.\n\nHowever, Manglani said that his images are also a useful barometer to measure actors’ presence on the screen.\n\nProducers, directors and the brands, “are keenly watching whom am I featuring, what’s happening and what is the traction on that celebrity,” Manglani said. “We used to run behind them. We wanted money, we were earning by the picture. Now it’s both ways. They also need us, we also need them.”\n\nAFP\n\n“We used to run behind them. We wanted money, we were earning by the picture.

She previously worked in (aviation solutions firm) SATS and because of that I got a rare opportunity to travel to Chennai on a jumpseat (an additional seat located in the cockpit or cabin of an aircraft). I’ve always treasured that experience.”\n\nAfter completing his mechanical engineering degree at the National University of Singapore in 2006,  Saravanan applied to Singapore Airlines’ pilot training programme, but it was during the financial crisis and the airline was not accepting trainees.\n\nAn unexpected opportunity to enter the media industry soon followed when he accompanied his friends to a Hello Vasantham audition. Thanks to his wit, charm and natural screen presence, he was shortlisted to be the host for the show.\n\nFrom there, Saravanan carved out a niche and identity for himself, all while earning accolades aplenty, including the best host award at Pradhana Vizha not less than seven times.\n\nThe dream of flying, however, never strayed far from his mind.\n\n“I realised that no matter how much I liked being in the media, the idea of flying never left me,” he said.\n\nIn 2015, when Scoot airlines introduced its pilot training programme, Saravanan gave his aspirations another go. Training spanned two-and-a-half years, including a stint in Perth for more than a year.\n\n“I was already married during that period. My wife Aakarshana was an air stewardess with Singapore Airlines previously, and so she understood the situation.”\n\nSaravanan describes his first solo flight as a life-changing experience.\n\n“My first flight was to Harbin, in China. Scoot does not fly to that destination now. I was so excited and nervous.

I just had a cup of tasteless chai in Gurgaon. Rs169 ($2.70) with tax.”\n\nHe did not name the cafe, but from his photo, the word Chaayos can be seen engraved on his kulhad, the handle-free traditional earthen clay cup.\n\nChaayos is an established tea chain with over 200 outlets across many cities in India, according to its website.\n\nMr Wong’s post soon went viral. As at Dec 16, it had been viewed over 760,000 times, with 9,500 likes and hundreds of comments.\n\nIn response, many netizens invited him to try their homemade chai, to which he said: “I humbly thank you all.”\n\nOne of the commenters was the founder of Chaayos, Mr Nitin Saluja, who swiftly extended an invitation to Mr Wong to try his chai again.\n\n“In the name of deep India-SG friendship, I invite you for a cup of chai at a Chaayos near you! And as we enjoy our chai, I will share our commitment to get every chai right, including our no-questions-asked chai replacement policy,” said Mr Saluja.\n\nIn response, Mr Wong said: “It is very gracious of you. I was in sector 59 looking at factory land. I googled best chai near me and found the shop. No shade intended.”\n\nMr Saluja then quipped that “Google is right”, although it looked like “we messed up with your chai today”. He followed up with his invitation again, saying he looked forward to having chai together with Mr Wong.\n\nMeanwhile, many netizens started the recommendation ball rolling.\n\nAn X user called @midwaythoughts_ said Mr Wong should go for “a taste of real India” instead. “Chai tastes best from the roadside stalls. You and 16 others could have enjoyed a cuppa each, without taxes, for that amount.”\n\nMany users also invited Mr Wong to their homes for homemade chai, with some listing the ingredients they use.\n\nA Singaporean user, Vijay, reminded Mr Wong that there is also the delightful teh tarik back home.\n\n“Kindly visit Tampines Mart, you are missing teh tarik, sir. Be my guest.”\n\nConcluding the exchange, Mr Wong said on X: “The true beauty of India lies in her people.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the torrent of invitations to have a cup of the best homemade chai. I humbly thank you all.”\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nSingapore’s High Commissioner to India Simon Wong.\n\nPhoto: @SGinIndia/ X", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b1a902704e80ec7a50790de0efa154351b1cd05205e1648b1e2affea9eee158e?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

But I was amazed at how seasoned many of them were, and found myself observing more than showing,” he said.\n\nPowerlifting focuses on lifting the most weight possible in three lifts: bench press, squat and deadlift, while weightlifting focuses on lifting weights quickly and with proper technique in two lifts: the snatch and clean and jerk.\n\nThe workshop on Dec 8 was co-organised by the Ace Group, a division under the Ministry of Manpower to safeguard the well-being of the migrant workforce, in the lead-up to International Migrants Day.\n\nAmong the rows of blocks, one room on the ground floor housed several exercise machines, dumbbells and bench press equipment.\n\nThe well-equipped ad hoc gymnasium is a result of several years of savings by workers who wished to seriously pursue their passion for exercise and powerlifting. The dormitory management also contributed to setting it up.\n\nLeading the men was migrant worker Parshotam, 35, who hails from Punjab.\n\nMuscular and imposing, Mr Parshotam is an avid sportsman, trained in the art of mud-wrestling since childhood. He also enjoys cricket and kabaddi, and once represented India’s national wrestling team at school level.\n\n“I wanted to share my fitness knowledge with my brothers here,” he told tabla! “I have many students in India, and I see many of the guys here as my students also.”\n\nAlong with Mr Parshotam, dormmate Shanramohan Dhanamohan, 31, guides his compatriots with exercising and diet regimens.\n\n“Many of us start work in the morning and reach our dorms around 7pm. Sometimes we also have night duty. But we work out whenever we can, however late it may be,” said Mr Dhanamohan, who deadlifted 200kg – his personal best – during the workshop.\n\nMr Dhanamohan, who hails from Tamil Nadu, said that unlike most fitness enthusiasts, he and his fellow workers are not able to adhere to customised, healthy diets.\n\nNevertheless, “being both flexible and disciplined is key”, he said when asked what advice he gives to his dormmates.\n\nDorm resident K. Mahendhar Babu said he enjoyed the workshop conducted by the poly students. “This session was a way to break stereotypes about migrant workers like us,” said Mr Babu, who has worked in Singapore for 12 years and is a fire protection engineer.\n\n“In public, there is no opportunity for us to interact with such students. I often wonder what their lifestyle is like, and if they would speak with us.\n\n“During the workshop, it felt like we were all the same, motivating one another to do our best.”\n\nMr Martin Koh, deputy chief of MOM’s Ace Group, said the workshop was part of a series of recreational activities that have led to the formation of bonds between migrant workers and the local community.\n\n“The powerlifting event, led by Singapore Polytechnic students, is an example of a shared passion which brought the students and migrant workers together,” he said.\n\n“This year, we are heartened to see several youth-led initiatives such as a frisbee tournament, a kitemaking workshop and a tour to Gardens by the Bay between youths and migrant workers. We hope more will step forward to join us in raising awareness and appreciation of our migrant community’s contributions.”\n\nSingapore Polytechnic student Danish Irfan assisting a migrant worker during a bench press exercise.\n\nPhoto: Sundara Nataraaj", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/69d859fcd7599fdcfc2165f9fe19ce069ba5441ecf02fe1798f1b8a57b8d283a?w=825", "alt_text": "Migrant workers Parshotam (left) and Shanramohan Dhanamohan lifting during a workshop on powerlifting by Singapore Polytechnic and MOM’s Ace Group."}]}

He had promised her a job as a cook in Dubai and took Rs20,000 ($320) from her.\n\nBut after being kept at an undisclosed location for three months, Madam Hamida was instead moved to Hyderabad, a major city in Pakistan’s Sindh province, where she was forced to fend for herself.\n\nShe had no documents to prove that she was an Indian as all her possessions were taken away by the agent and his Pakistani associates.\n\nMadam Hamida told PTI that her life in Hyderabad was tough. “It was like being a ‘zinda laash’ (living corpse),” she said. “The Pakistani government never harmed me, though.\n\n“I used to live with a Sindhi fruit seller from Karachi who married me. But, after 12 years, he died due to Covid-19. After that, I lived with my stepson.”\n\nIn 2022, she contacted local YouTuber Waliullah Maroof, who shared her ordeal.\n\nShe told him that, before being duped to work in Pakistan, she had been financially supporting her four children in India after her husband’s death. She had previously worked as a cook in Doha, Dubai and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHer story made headlines in July 2022 after Indian journalist Khalfan Shaikh watched the YouTube interview conducted by Mr Waliullah and shared it on his platform.\n\nThat year, Madam Hamida’s grandson saw the vlog and made contact with her. Her daughter Yasmeen also spoke to her over the phone.\n\nIn the video call, Ms Yasmeen is seen asking her mother: “How are you? Do you recognise me? Where were you all these years?”\n\nMadam Hamida replies: “Don’t ask me where I was, and how I have been. I missed you all so much. I didn’t stay here willingly, I had no other choice.”\n\nLater, activists in Pakistan and India helped Madam Hamida reunite with her family. Both India and Pakistan conducted extensive checks before her Indian nationality was confirmed in October, reported the BBC. The entire process took two years.\n\nAfter arriving in India on Monday in a wheelchair, she recalled the 2022 video that helped her connect with her family after years: “My video was shared two years ago. Even then, I was not sure if I would ever (come back to) India.\n\n“I was overjoyed to see the Indian tricolour when I reached the Wagah border.”\n\nOn Wednesday, ensconced in her one-room home in Kurla, central Mumbai, and surrounded by her two sons, two daughters and several grandchildren, Madam Hamida exclaimed: “Mumbai looks so different now.”\n\nShe had a piece of advice for those seeking jobs abroad:  “I would like to caution people looking for jobs abroad that they should use the proper channels.\n\n“Many women like me from India and Bangladesh who were deceived by agents are still stuck in Pakistan.”\n\nMadam Hamida Bano who from Pakistan after 22 years.\n\nPhoto: Screengrab from YouTube", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a0fc1675914a8ea9635e5d9a7ef425740f24f069150311e885f9acd0dd66949b?w=825", "alt_text": "Madam Hamida Bano with her family back home in Mumbai."}]}

It will be located on MWC’s premises, at 579 Serangoon Road in Little India.\n\nA memorandum of understanding between the two organisations was signed on Dec 15 at the International Migrants Day 2024 celebration organised by the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group and MWC.\n\nInternational Migrants Day fell on Dec 18.\n\nThe new law centre will expand Pro Bono SG’s capacity to deliver legal awareness and advice to migrant workers, said the charity’s chairman Gregory Vijayendran.\n\nIt will have a full-time on-site lawyer and programme coordinator. It will also tap volunteers from Pro Bono SG’s extensive pool, SG Cares Volunteer Centres and other community organisations specialising in migrant worker support.\n\nThis will complement Pro Bono SG’s existing services for migrant workers, who can currently seek free basic legal advice at its legal clinic at Angullia Mosque in Little India on two Sundays a month and at its office at Havelock Square.\n\nThe legal clinic at the mosque opened in May 2022, and has seen a high demand for its services. There were 40 per cent more migrant workers seeking legal assistance there in 2024, compared with 2023, Mr Vijayendran said.\n\nThe new centre, which will open from Tuesday to Sunday, will likely be able to handle multiple consultations a day.\n\n“With an available, accessible on-site lawyer, migrant workers will receive immediate professional legal advice and assistance, especially for acute injustice cases,” said Mr Vijayendran.\n\n“Our centre will also be a first responder service to reduce delays or barriers our migrant community faces in access to justice.”\n\nHe said some of the common areas migrant workers need help with are salary claims, work injury claims, and employment-related, scam and moneylending issues.\n\nDesigned to “significantly enhance capacity”, the new centre aims to engage more than 1,000 migrant workers and serve over 120 migrant workers through its legal guidance and representation schemes in 2025, Mr Vijayendran added.\n\nMr Mariyaselvam Alexander, 44, who works in the construction sector, said one of the common issues his fellow migrant workers have recently faced is scams. “Some workers are aware of scams... but some do not know what is real or fake,” he said.\n\nMr Mariyaselvam hopes that with the new law centre, migrant workers can better seek advice on what to do when they get scammed or face other problems like workplace injuries.\n\nThe Migrant Workers’ Assistance Fund will finance the centre for two years, and operations may be subsequently extended, depending on the demand for its services.\n\nOn Dec 15, more than 10,000 members of the migrant community attended the International Migrants Day celebration in Jurong Lake Gardens, which featured performances by local and international artistes as well as the finals of a kabaddi tournament.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0f98e458e0fb9af4dfed714c74ee635e5f78f2dd202e1ee06f3b565858279be9?w=825", "alt_text": "An event celebrating International Migrants Day at Jurong Lake Gardens on Dec 15."}]}

Stop false cases!” The walls in the park had posters with a line from Mr Subhash’s video: “Dump my ashes in the gutter outside the court if my harassers are not punished.”\n\nKarnataka Home Minister G. Parameshwara said the investigation into Mr Subhash’s suicide will look into why his wife “kept filing cases against him”.\n\nHe added: “We always talked about women’s rights. (Mr Subhash’s) case has exposed men’s rights. It’s a debate (happening) throughout the country.”\n\nMRAs claim that men in India are oppressed by marriage laws and women who file false reports against them. They identify the judicial system and organised feminist groups as the primary culprits.\n\n“The judicial and police ecosystem is not humane to men. It does not recognise men’s vulnerabilities,” said Mr Anil Kumar, co-founder of Save Indian Family. “It forces husbands and men to suffer for years under false domestic violence cases and extortionist alimony demands.”\n\nMr Kumar confirmed that Mr Subhash had frequented the weekly meetings of Save Indian Family in Bengaluru since his wife moved out with their four-year-old son.\n\nFrom the early days of scattered solitary actions in the 1990s, MRAs have emerged in India as a well-organised social movement, with careful outreach through social media, legislative lobbying and street action.\n\nMRA groups in Bengaluru and Mumbai said at least 150 men turn up at their meetings every week, but their social media handles have hundreds of followers.\n\nProfessor Srimati Basu, chair of the gender studies department in the University of Kentucky in the US, said: “The men’s rights movement has not had big systematic actions in the last 10 years compared with the decade before.\n\n“But its concerted communication and grassroots meetings in the past decade have made a dent in public and legal discourse.”\n\nShe added: “Atul Subhash’s death, though unfortunate and unexpected, seems suddenly to have become a catalysing event, a remobilising moment for the men’s rights movement.”\n\nRohini Mohan for The Straits Times\n\nMen’s rights activists in Mumbai on Dec 15 at a sit-in demanding justice for Mr Atul Subhash, whom they claim died by suicide because of alleged false cases of domestic violence filed by his wife.\n\nPHOTO: COURTESY OF VAASTAV FOUNDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ac67677663d70456aca561bb6c2a32b8432503fde2471dcc2a3b9b932ede043b?w=825", "alt_text": "Late Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash (centre), who died by suicide on Dec 9, with activists such as Mr Anil Kumar (right)."}]}

Seven years down the road, at the age of 38, he tasted his first international victory in an in-person event, winning silver in both the Recognized Poomsae and Virtual Taekwondo categories for the Under-40 Male-Dan (an advanced rank) at the 10th Daedo Taekwondo Open Championships held from Dec 6 to 8 at Our Tampines Hub.\n\nThe competition was sanctioned by the Singapore Taekwondo Federation and saw over 70 teams from 13 countries participating in close to 2,000 events.\n\nRecognized Poomsae refers to a sequence of taekwondo techniques where one spars with an imaginary competitor, whereas in Virtual Taekwondo, athletes don a VR headset and motion tracking nodes to compete against the avatar of their opponent.\n\nCompeting under the Indian flag, in Poomsae, Yuvaraj’s 7.232 points placed him just behind gold-medallist Park Seong Jong from Singapore (7.882). In Virtual Taekwondo, he finished between two Filipino podium winners.\n\n“It was a journey riddled with challenges,” Yuvraj said. “Just this October, I quit my job as an advanced taekwondo instructor at J H Kim Taekwondo Institute and returned to Arakkonam, Tamil Nadu, as my father had an accident.”\n\nAs Yuvaraj helped his father recuperate in India, there lingered a sense of unfulfilment – that he had not reached a pinnacle befitting his ten years in Singapore.\n\n“That was when I decided that I wanted to return to Singapore to compete in the Daedo competition,” he said. “I had previously won golds in two online international events but never in an in-person event before, so I wanted to make it count this time.”\n\nIn three previous Daedo events, Yuvaraj raised funds and brought his taekwondo students from India to participate in the competition. They were students from the Kalam UV Foundation, a non-profit he started in 2009, inspired by former Indian president APJ Abdul Kalam. The foundation supports Indian students in their education and sports.\n\n“My goal is to give deserving students the opportunity to shine. Some students whom I brought from India to the Daedo championships don’t even have a proper house or complete family,” he said.\n\nThe students repaid the faith with a good run, winning gold and silver medals at the previous Daedo championships. This year, however, Yuvaraj was unable to fly them over and had to be the sole representative from India.\n\nNevertheless, he dreams of a bright future for them: “One day, I want to see them compete in the Olympics. As for myself, I want to become an Olympic referee one day.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9cc98c758b68685119d3c8749dfff25c5b6285a03a838358f1081193d9a98b99?w=825", "alt_text": "Yuvaraj Loganathan with his medals at the 10th Daedo Taekwondo Open Championships at Our Tampines Hub."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAt 73, life has turned around beautifully for Viji Venkatesh.\n\nShe is not only making inroads into the Malayalam film industry, the Tamil actress is also a leader in cancer care and advocacy in India.\n\n“I think it’s like a second innings for me,” she said during a recent visit to Singapore. “It was not all smooth sailing when I set out to build a life after marriage. But now I can say that I’m doing good and loving what I’m doing.”\n\nRaised in a Brahmin household in Delhi, Viji married in 1974 and moved to Venezuela with her husband who was then in the oil business. But they soon lost all their money in the economic and political crisis that enveloped the South American country. Forced to move out, they rebuilt their lives in the United States and Mumbai.\n\nA job at the Seattle-based non-profit The Max Foundation gave her something that she liked to do: providing cancer patients access to high-impact medicines. Then, out of the blue in 2022, she got an offer to act in the Malayalam film Paachuvum Albuthavilakkum (which means Pachu and the Magic Lamp).\n\nHer performance as Ummachi, an independent elderly woman who defies societal norms, earned her plaudits. Now she is slated for two more Malayalam films, one of them alongside superstar Mammooty.\n\n“I think I did good with my first film,” she said. “It’s a unique space I created. Through me people are seeing that an older woman can be a little different. She doesn’t have to be the stereotypical mother.”\n\nViji gives credit to the young directors for seeing her that way. “They know what they want and will go all out to get the person they have in mind to play a character,” she said.\n\nA prolific social media user, Viji received a message on Instagram out of the blue from a casting director who said that Malayalam director Akhil Sathyan wanted to cast her in his film. “He and his team saw a photograph of mine and felt I fitted the role,” said Viji. “But I told the casting director I have a full-time job and my Malayalam was bad. No one expects to be offered a role at my age, so I really didn’t give too much thought to it.”\n\nBut Akhil insisted on meeting her, she said. They met at a cafe in Mumbai and she was impressed with his enthusiasm. “He’s a delightful young man who’s so passionate and energetic,” said Viji. “After hearing the story and the role, I said yes.”\n\nThe production crew helped Viji improve her Malayalam speaking skills and made it easy for her to act. “One of my first scenes was with (noted Malayalam actor) Fahadh Faasil, and I messed it up a bit,” she said. “But he was understanding and calmed my nerves.”\n\nPeople soon began to praise her performance as Ummachi, and offers soon followed. She is currently shooting for a Malayalam movie helmed by veteran director Jayaraj.\n\nViji, who has two sons, a granddaughter and a grandson, has a busy life these days, acting and travelling around India to propagate her Chai for Cancer initiative, which she started as a fundraiser for underprivileged cancer patients.\n\n“Many government hospitals have amazing support programmes where patients get free medication,” she said. “But they don’t have resources such as nutrition, shelter, transport fare and money for diagnostics.”\n\nViji, who is the region head of India and South Asia at The Max Foundation, is also the managing trustee of the Friends of Max subsidiary she initiated 20 years ago. Today, it aids 18,000 cancer patients. The donations the subsidiary receives fund the Chai for Cancer meetings, where people are invited to sip tea and make contributions.\n\n“Chai is comfort and mohabbat (“love” in Urdu),” she said. “I wanted to bring cancer into this space of normalcy. This illness has so much emotional baggage and inordinate fear. Chai for Cancer stands for spreading knowledge, support and comradeship.”\n\nViji knows what it feels to have a cancer patient in the family, having lost her husband to cancer last year.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMusically inclined Indians living in Singapore still rave about the brilliant music that Zakir Hussain produced on the tabla during the Triveni concert at the Esplanade on Aug 15, 2022.\n\nZakir, whose “dancing fingers” made him one of the greatest ever tabla players, died aged 73 in a San Francisco hospital on Monday due to complications from chronic lung disease.\n\nAt the Triveni show, on stage with violin virtuoso Kala Ramnath and Saraswati veena exponent Jayanthi Kumaresh, he took the art of playing the tabla to remarkable heights – beyond its classical traditions.\n\n“Triveni is the mythical site of the union of the sacred rivers Yamuna, Ganga and Saraswati in India, and the name aptly represented the confluence of the varied music strains the three maestros brought to the collaboration,” said Mr K.V. Rao, president of the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society (Sifas), which organised the event.\n\n“A hallmark of Zakirbai’s iconic career has been his groundbreaking work featuring brilliant musical dialogues between Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic (South Indian) music. He seamlessly stitched North and South Indian rhythm traditions to provide a bridge for veena and violin to meet. Triveni was a fluent, joyous and entirely original conversation, a music experience of the highest order.”\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who attended the event, was so enthused by the Triveni concept that he once co-related it to the “collective capability” that could spur India’s growth.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural Arun Jaitley Memorial Lecture in July 2022, at the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr Tharman, who was then the deputy prime minister, said: “Listening to an outstanding musical performance called Triveni... I realised it was not about their individual genius, it was about each of them listening to the other, teasing, co-creating and co-empowering. It was a collective genius.”\n\nApplying this idea to India as a nation, he explained: “India has no lack of individual top talents. But what it has to develop is that collective capability, co-empowerment, co-creation, and having a high degree of trust among each other. Co-empowerment and co-creation between the government and the private sector, between the centre and the states, and the panchayats at the district and village level, and across caste, class, faiths, white and blue collar, and gender.\n\n“Develop this collective capability for the next 25 years. That is India’s promise. And if India succeeds, as I believe it will, it will not just uplift one-fifth of the world’s population, it will also show the way for many others.”\n\nMr Rao, 64, believes Zakir was pivotal in giving Indian music overseas exposure – as he collaborated with musicians of all genres, including African drummers, western guitarists and Latin and Caribbean percussionists.\n\nThe tabla maestro is most famous for his 1973 musical project with English guitarist John McLaughlin, violinist L. Shankar and percussionist T.H. “Vikku” Vinayakram that brought together Indian classical and elements of jazz in a fusion hitherto unknown.\n\nThe master collaborator has worked with The Beatles, Van Morrison and The Grateful Dead, among others. He has scored music for Francis Ford Coppola (\n\nApocalypse Now\n\n), Ismail Merchant (\n\nThe Mystic Masseur\n\n) and Bernardo Bertolucci (\n\nLittle Buddha\n\n). His discography cannot be contained on a page.\n\nZakir first played in Singapore in 1973. He was on his way to Perth for a music festival and stopped by to play at a small hall. After that, he returned to the Republic several times, and the Esplanade became one of his favourite places to perform “because of its amazing theatre design and acoustics”.\n\n“Like Ravi Shankar with the sitar, Zakirbhai took tabla to different corners of the globe,” said Mr Rao, who first met Zakir in 1996. “He was exceptionally humble, compassionate and daring. He respected co-artistes and was very supportive of them.”\n\nA long-standing friend of Sifas, Zakir gave several lectures to its students and teachers on the finer points of music.\n\n“He was extremely well-read and articulate. He could talk with authority on any subject,” said Mr Rao. “He endeared himself to everybody with his simple mannerisms and humour. He was very mature, very philosophical; a world citizen.”\n\nI interacted with Zakir for more than an hour at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hall during the Sifas press meet before the Triveni concert, and later at the Indian High Commissioner’s residence. I found him to be friendly and engaging, with lots of stories to tell. He was also full of energy and fit, bounding up stairs with agility.\n\nHis answers to my questions were rather elaborate, and I was forced to leave out chunks while writing my piece in tabla! titled “Tabla maestro breaks barriers” (Aug 19, 2022) – about the Triveni concert.\n\nWhen I asked him what the tabla! publication meant to him, he said: “The paper types the words out in a rhythm that spells a connection to an instrument called tabla.\n\n“The tabla is not just a drum but a world of wondrous discovery, knowledge and joy. These elements are completely and affectionately reproduced in this newspaper called tabla!”\n\nBorn on March 9, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, Zakir was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history’s most iconic tabla players.\n\nZakir’s journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation. He lived in the United States for much of his life – mostly in California.\n\nThe New York Times, in reviewing the artiste’s performance at Carnegie Hall in 2009, wrote: “Zakir Hussain, the peerless Indian tabla player, favours an impish strain of virtuosity. He’s a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird’s wings.”\n\nMusic for Zakir was not just a career but a spiritual journey – a way to connect with people, traditions and cultures across the globe.\n\nMr Ashutosh Thakur, an assistant professor of economics at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy who attended annual workshops of Zakir since 2003, said: “Zakirbhai showed us how to surrender to art and tradition by always being a student, how to respect one’s elders, contemporaries and juniors alike, and also how to keep innovating by tastefully and musically challenging the sometimes overbearing shackles of tradition.”\n\nTo Mr Thakur, a consummate tabla player himself, Zakir was the most complete performer he had ever seen.\n\n“Every single audience member, regardless of age, culture, race, ethnicity and musical background left every single performance of his completely awestruck and convinced that they had just witnessed something truly magical,” said Mr Thakur.\n\n“Every time Zakirbhai played, he would have a fresh take; he would find new expressions and new rhythmic ideas.”\n\nZakir’s only other known student in Singapore, Vimal Venkatram, was too distraught to speak to tabla!. On Wednesday, he was on his way to San Francisco to attend his mentor’s funeral.\n\nZakir leaves behind his wife Antonia Minnecola, whom he married in 1978, and children Isabella Qureshi and Anisa Qureshi.\n\nThen Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam presenting a token of appreciation to Zakir Hussain after the Triveni concert in 2022, as Sifas president K.V Rao and Mr Tharman’s wife Jane Ittogi look on.\n\nPhoto: K.V.

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndian chess grandmaster Gukesh Dommaraju has become a multi-millionaire following his world title win over China’s Ding Liren in Singapore last week.\n\nThe 18-year-old pocketed Rs11.45 crore ($1.8 million) as prize money, and an additional Rs5 crore as a present from Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin. In the days ahead, he is set to get more from sponsors and companies who want to hitch onto his winning bandwagon.\n\nAfter taxes (the Indian government will probably give him a rebate), he will net at least a cool Rs15 crore, which should offset the considerable expenses his parents had to foot as he progressed up the ladder in world chess.\n\nFor his Singapore outing, Gukesh had Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski as his trainer and South African Paddy Upton, who has done wonders with the Indian cricket and hockey teams, as a mental coach. Both cost a hefty package.\n\n“I’ve been dreaming about this moment since I started my chess journey at about seven... but the dream was probably bigger for them than it was for me,” Gukesh said about his parents Rajnikanth and Padma Kumari after he bagged the world title at the Equarius Hotel on Sentosa on Dec 12.\n\nHis father quit his job as a surgeon in 2018 to accompany him to chess tournaments, while his mother worked as a microbiologist to support the family.\n\n“We were not a very well-off family, so they faced a lot of financial struggles though I didn’t realise it at the time,” said the Chennai-born player whose family hails from Chenchuraju Kandriga in Andhra Pradesh’s Tirupati district.\n\n“At some point in 2017 and 2018, we were running so low on money that my parents’ friends sponsored me. My parents had to make many lifestyle changes just for me to play tournaments... My whole journey is not just for me. I love them both.”\n\nMr Rajinikanth was with Gukesh in Singapore throughout. His mother, grandmother and other relatives joined him after he beat Ding.\n\nTo fully appreciate the sacrifices his parents made, we need to go back to 2013, when Gukesh developed a fascination for chess. In his home city, he watched Norwegian Magnus Carlsen wrest the world title from Indian great Vishwanathan Anand. The seven-year-old then said to himself: “I want to bring the title back to India.”\n\nAs his skill in the game grew, his mother noticed his ability to attack strategically at a remarkably fast rate. To support his talent, his parents agreed for him to leave his studies behind after Class IV (Primary 2) and devote himself full-time to chess.\n\nThe Chennai prodigy achieved the title of grandmaster at age 12. But at that time, with no sponsors, funding was a problem – Mr Rajinikanth quit his job to travel around the world with Gukesh on a shoestring budget. They often slept on floors and on chairs in airports to save money on accommodation.\n\nOn one occasion, as has been well documented, his father borrowed a bike from a hotel and pedalled some 10km in freezing temperatures to take Gukesh to a tournament.\n\nGukesh’s mother assumed the mantle of breadwinner for the family. But, with money running low, they often had to ask family and friends for support. A few crowd-funding initiatives and Gukesh’s prize-money also helped.\n\n“Every parent would do the same,” said Mr Rajinikanth. “If you see that your child has talent in something, it is your duty to allow him or her to flourish. That’s all we did.”\n\nGukesh’s mother told ChessBase India a few months ago that they never forced anything on their only child. “We allowed him to take up his passion,” she said. “For us, one thing was sure – that Gukesh was not going to waste time. He worked hard and showed results.”\n\nUpton, who mentored Gukesh for six months before the world championship, said: “Gukesh is not only a chess world champion, he is a world-class human being first.”\n\nFrom the beginning, his mother impressed on him the need to always be humble. The first four things Gukesh (the name means conqueror of the universe, according to his mother) did after winning the world title were: reset the chess board, thank God, hug his father and trainer, and praise Ding’s efforts.\n\nTimes Now reported that Gukesh’s net worth is now an estimated Rs20 crore, jumping from Rs8.26 crore at the beginning of the year. He was also gifted a Mercedes after becoming world champion.\n\nThe family’s financial burdens appear to have eased, with years of struggle, sacrifice and self-belief finally paying off.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/06bf1f84dbf246462b19c7dd4a7dc10538160fcb058e9850f1aeba421293a2e3?w=825", "alt_text": "Gukesh Dommaraju with his parents and the World Chess Championship trophy."}]}

A total of 84 imported films, including 28 Hollywood movies, were released in the country in 2023.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0ee157c3f0c358c7e15dcac3cb1b3638f23b5e23a8855b9a5e87bdf533360f4f?w=825", "alt_text": "A Chinese poster of Maharaja, which has proven to be a hit in China."}]}

In his suicide note, he accused a family court judge in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, of dismissing his pleas, and alleged that a court officer openly accepted bribes.\n\nAuthorities found Mr Subhash’s body at his Manjunath Layout residence in Bengaluru on Monday, with a placard stating “Justice is due”. He recorded an 80-minute video on the website Rumble explaining his decision, which subsequently went viral.\n\n“I feel that I should kill myself because the money I earn is making my enemies stronger. That same money will be used to destroy me, and this cycle will keep going,” Mr Subhash said in the video.\n\nHis uncle Pawan Kumar alleged harassment over financial demands, stating the wife’s family initially requested Rs40,000 monthly, which increased to Rs1 lakh.\n\n“His wife even said that he should commit suicide if he cannot pay the amount – to which the judge also laughed. This really hurt him,” PTI quoted Mr Kumar as saying.\n\nMs Nikita’s uncle Sushil denied involvement, stating: “I came to know that I am also named in the FIR. I am innocent. I wasn’t even there. We got to know about his suicide through the media. None of our family members were present at the scene of incident.\n\n“The case went on in the court for the last three years and during this time, we did not have any communication with him or his family. We are not at fault.”\n\nPolice investigations revealed ongoing marital disputes and a case filed against Mr Subhash in Uttar Pradesh. Before his death, he distributed his note via e-mail and shared it with an NGO WhatsApp group.\n\nThe death note reportedly mentions that Mr Subhash got married in 2019 and that the couple had a son the following year.\n\n“I want my brother to get justice,” his brother Bikas told PTI. “I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can get justice. I want strict action against those who are sitting on a legal chair and doing corruption because if this continues then how will people expect justice.”\n\nMr Bikas expressed concerns about systemic corruption, noting that justice requires an unbiased system where all parties receive fair hearings based on facts.\n\n“People can expect justice only when decisions are made on the basis of facts, and if it does not happen, then people will slowly start losing faith in the judicial system.\n\n“It may lead to a situation where people are afraid to get married. Men may start feeling that if they get married, they will just end up being an ATM machine,” he said.\n\nBengaluru police have dispatched teams to Uttar Pradesh to question Ms Nikita and her family.\n\nThe case has also reignited debates about the pressures faced by individuals caught in prolonged legal battles, particularly those involving family disputes and financial demands.\n\nIt has also brought allegations of harassment, extortion and abuse of law and authority to national focus.\n\nIMAGE: A screengrab from the video Atul Subhash recorded before tragically ending his life.\n\nPhoto: YouTube\n\nBengaluru techie Atul Subhash.\n\nPhoto: X\n\n“I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can get justice.”\n\nMr Bikas Kumar, brother of Mr Atul Subhash, who committed suicide after accusing his wife, her relatives and a judge of harassment, extortion and corruption.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7860eb2791ff202f91a8298268c8bf8f8e1cfb2e57af1443235178000cb9f05f?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Atul Subhash’s (forefront) family said he was under a lot of stress because of the divorce case."}]}

They were adopted by Indian parents after their Chinese birth mother had died when they were four and three.\n\nPhoto: Manoranjitham Param\n\nகி. ஜனார்த்தனன்\n\nWhen Madam Jane Devasahayam was born 86 years ago to Chinese parents, she was considered unlucky as her mother had died during childbirth. Her father, a farmer in Johor Bahru, gave her away to an Indian family shortly after.\n\n“The day I arrived at my new family’s home, my adopted father won the lottery,” Madam Jane told tabla!\n\n“So I also grew up with the nickname Pakiam, which means good fortune in Tamil.”\n\nInspired by the anecdote and the tales of other Chinese children who were adopted and raised by Indian parents in Singapore pre-1960s, Madam Jane’s daughter, sociologist Dr Theresa Devasahayam, embarked on a trail to document the lived experiences of 14 such women.\n\nHer book, entitled Little Drops: Cherished Children Of Singapore’s Past, was published on Feb 20, and documents anecdotes on Singapore’s history with cross-cultural adoption.\n\nThough she said it’s difficult to ascertain how many such adoptions took place between the 1930s and 1960s, Dr Theresa estimated the number to be in the thousands.\n\n“I wanted to pass on these lived experiences to the younger generation, many of whom may not know that this phenomenon of cross-cultural adoption had once been relatively common in Singapore,” she said.\n\nMadam Jane shared some of the challenges she faced growing up, such as when she would ask her adoptive mother of her origin.\n\n“I asked her, ‘how come I am so fair-skinned?’ My mother would jokingly reply that it was because I fell into a tub of milk,” she reminisced with a laugh.\n\nMadam Jane never picked up the Chinese language. In school, she learnt English and Malay, and even Latin. She learnt to speak Tamil on her own.\n\nWhen she was a young adult, her mother eventually told her the truth about her adoption. She then tried to seek out her birth family – but her efforts were unsuccessful. Despite that, she looks back on her life with gratitude towards her adoptive parents.\n\nMadam Saraswathi Nagalingam, also documented in the book, learnt of her true origins when she was 12.\n\nThe 75-year-old’s foster parents were originally from India and settled in Singapore during the 1940s.\n\n“I do not know exactly at which age I was given away,” Madam Saraswathi said. “But I did see photographs of myself aged possibly two or three, with my adoptive parents, so I am guessing that I was adopted before that”.\n\nShe remembers that although she was not treated any differently at school, there were some students who used to insist she was Chinese, which would make her cry.\n\n“I used to dislike how I looked. To comfort me, my mother would tell me that my skin would eventually be like hers as I grew older,” she said.\n\nAs a form of protection, her mother made her wear a pottu (little black dot) on her forehead during the 1964 race riot between the Chinese and Malays.\n\n“This proved tricky, as I was attending a Methodist school, which at the time, discouraged Indian students from wearing the pottu. Once I removed the pottu and my mother found out. She was so upset with me that I never dared again to remove it. From that day, I realised the extent of her love for me,” Madam Sarawathi said.\n\nShe also recalled a Chinese woman who used to turn up at her house occasionally when she was a child – only to be shooed away by her parents. She inferred that the woman was her birth mother, but never dared to ask her foster mum about it. When she turned 12, she discovered she was Chinese by birth from her birth certificate.\n\n“My adoptive mother insisted there was a mistake in the birth certificate. I was old enough to know the truth, but I loved her too much to ever bring the matter up again,” she said.\n\nYears later, when she was married, her husband once suggested she put an advertisement in the Chinese newspapers to locate her birth family.\n\n“I told him, you find that out if you want, but I am not interested. As far as I am concerned, I already have a family of my own,” she said.\n\nStateless\n\nGrowing up in the kampung of Aljunied, Madam Thangah Koh was treated as an Indian in school and by her neighbours, who were predominantly Malay.\n\nThe 72-year-old, whose foster father was a kacang putih seller, recalled the time she was left confused after being refused a pink identification card (IC).\n\nInstead, at the age of 14, she was given a blue IC, and told by a government official that she was Chinese.\n\n“The officer asked me if I was Chinese. I said, no! But he insisted that I was, showing my original Chinese name in my birth certificate. It was only then that I noticed my Chinese name for the first time,” Madam Thangah said.\n\nShe was told that unless she could locate her birth parents, she could not be issued a pink IC. Eventually, Madam Thangah and her foster mother did find her birth family – at a flat in MacPherson.\n\n“My birth family were all in tears when they first saw me. Yet, strangely, I did not feel anything. Eventually I found out that another sister of mine was adopted by a Malay family,” she said.\n\nToday, as it was then, Madam Thangah expressed her pride in identifying as a Tamil woman: “I love my language, culture, customs and religion. To me, Tamil means beauty.”\n\nThose in the Tamil community who have attended Tamil literary events might find Madam Manoranjitham Param a familiar face.\n\nThe 76-year-old, who is well versed in Tamil literature, is a regular at such events, where she stands out for her appearance.\n\nMadam Mano was adopted by a couple who had lost a child after he drowned in a river in Bukit Timah in the 1950s. Though they had two other sons, they adopted Madam Mano and her sister, who were four and three respectively at the time.\n\n“My adopted mother, who was grieving the loss of her son, gradually became herself again after she adopted us,” said Madam Mano, whose birth mother died shortly after her younger sister was born.\n\nHer father, she said, often encouraged her to study instead of doing household chores.\n\n“I became studious. In school I was always the top student in Tamil,” she said.\n\nShe recalled how her Tamil teacher Mr Chelliah would praise her and scold “some lazy boys” in his class, saying “a Chinese girl can do so much better than you”. This prompted some teasing and name calling.\n\n“And then I would go to the teacher and say, please stop praising me.”\n\nCurrently, the Ministry of Social and Family Development governs matters of adoption in Singapore. Hence, these stories of adoption, mostly during the early years of Singapore’s independence, provide a glimpse into yesteryear Singapore, said Dr Theresa, who has worked in gender studies for more than 25 years.\n\n“These stories are very much part of our past. Without knowing about these stories, we will never be able to truly understand ourselves and what we are capable of as a people,” she said. “And because they are a crucial part of our collective memory, it’s important to document them.”\n\n(From left) Madam Thangah Koh, Madam Jane Devasahayam, Dr Theresa Devasahayam, Madam Manoranjitham Param and Madam Saraswathi Nagalingam.\n\nPhoto: P.

The protagonist, that is me, was delivering a heart-wrenching monologue, tears streaming down my face. The silence in the theatre was palpable – until suddenly a muffled “YES!” broke through.\n\nI was distracted. That was not a “Yes, you nailed it babe” kind of yes. Had my wig come askew? Had my petticoat fallen to my ankles? No. It was a gentleman in the third row, grinning ear to ear at his phone.\n\nYou see, while the audience was collectively mourning my character’s plight, this gentleman was following the cricket match on his phone. The glow of the screen illuminated his joy more than the spot light did for my grief.\n\nIndia’s hero of the day, Virat Kohli, had just hit a century against Australia in that unforgettable match on Nov 24. It didn’t bother the man one bit that he and his compadres (and there were a few) were interrupting my performance with muted cheers and a vigorous exchange of WhatsApp messages.\n\nThe funny thing is that the rest of the audience just rolled their eyes and carried on trying to enjoy the performance. After all, everyone just shrugs and accepts the inevitable – an Indian cricket aficionado and his phone cannot be parted! Even the ushers at the Esplanade had quietly given up trying to discipline the Indian audiences.\n\nThis, my dear readers, is the paradox of the Indian multitasker: emotionally invested in theatre, yet deeply committed to the cricket scoreboard.\n\nThe mobile magnet\n\nWhat is it about our phones that makes them such an irresistible extension of ourselves?\n\nIs it FOMO (fear of missing out)? Or is it that we Indians have mastered the art of juggling life’s grand performances – whether on stage or on a pitch?\n\nLet’s face it: Our phones have become the one-stop shop for everything. They’re our news anchors, cricket commentators, cameras and sometimes even the dinner date (because why make small talk when you can scroll and watch TikTok before it goes out of fashion).\n\nBut the addiction goes deeper. Where else can you find someone simultaneously live-streaming a wedding while commenting on a political debate and ordering online biryani? The multitasking prowess of Indians is unparalleled.\n\nAnd then there’s the notorious “forwarded many times” conspiracy theories, dissected with the same vigour one might reserve for a Nobel Prize-winning paper. “Did you know Nehru didn’t actually like cricket?” says one uncle, before launching into a tirade replete with emojis and exclamation marks.\n\nRules? What rules?\n\nAt the beginning of our performance, a woman with a sexy voice reminded the audience about not taking photos or videos while the performance was on. Was anyone even listening?\n\nI have often wondered about the audacity of sneaking photos and videos in places where signs scream “NO PHOTOGRAPHY”. Theatre? Click. Museum? Snap. Wedding? Forget about the couple; we’re live-streaming the buffet.\n\nIt’s not that we deliberately ignore the rules, it’s just that the rules seem... optional... unenforceable... unIndian.\n\nThe phone-camera combo is irresistible, like a mischievous sibling egging you on: “Come on, just one shot. Who’ll notice?” And before you know it, you’ve got a shaky, poorly lit video clip that you’ll never watch again.\n\nI remember watching most of the Zakir Hussain concert off the phone of the bald headed man in front of me who practically recorded the whole concert. Maybe his idea was to watch the concert twice for the cost of one ticket.\n\nThe great Indian group chat\n\nOf course, the photos and videos have a purpose – to fuel our beloved WhatsApp groups. There’s one for family, one for friends, one for schoolmates and one just for forwarding those “Good Morning” GIFs with sunflowers.\n\nThe theatre play may end at 9:45pm, but the debate over whether Kohli should have gone for a cover drive will last until sunrise, punctuated by memes and emojis.\n\nBut let’s get back to the theatre. Here’s the irony: while we’re busy documenting, we’re missing the magic of the moment. The actor’s powerful delivery becomes a blurred snapshot. The live performance becomes a highlight reel, viewed through a screen smaller than a slice of bread.\n\nAnd yet, I get it. We are a nation of storytellers. We don’t just consume experiences; we curate, share and archive them for eternity – or at least until we run out of cloud storage.\n\nBreaking Free (almost)\n\nSo, how do we cure this addiction? Honestly, it’s like asking an Indian wedding to end on time – it’s just not happening. But maybe we can make baby steps.\n\nThe next time you’re at a play, wedding or even a funeral (yes, we’ve seen busy phones there too), consider this: could you possibly enjoy the moment without recording it for your Instagram story?\n\nAnd if you must cheer for Kohli’s century during a play, here’s a tip: synchronise your applause with the audience clapping for the performance. Who knows, you might just pull it off.\n\nAfter all, if there’s one thing we Indians excel at, it’s multitasking – with flair.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/69c9f5bdc4b32962fd0ce94761106ef6157ceffd9accf22aa58fa7c412e16728?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The actor often attends such events, so this was no cause for alarm.\n\nRahul also paid an advance fee of Rs25,000, saying he would pay the balance later. The caller also sent Khan an air ticket from Mumbai to Delhi.\n\nOn Nov 20, Khan landed in Delhi and got into a cab sent by Rahul. Besides the driver, another man was in the car. At one point, the car stopped and the actor was asked to get into another vehicle.\n\nAccording to the police report, the same man drove the car and two others sat with Khan. The car stopped again and two more people got in.\n\nBy then, Khan smelled a rat and protested. The men then put a sheet over him and asked him to keep his head down.\n\nAbout four hours later, they reached a house. There, the kidnappers tortured Khan and asked him to call his family and transfer money into an account.\n\nThey took Khan’s phone and managed to transfer about Rs200,000 into the account.\n\nThe kidnappers then started drinking. When they were passed out early the next morning, the actor managed to escape.\n\nHe rushed to a nearby mosque where a cleric helped him contact his family.\n\nThe police report said the actor was unwell, so he asked his business partner Mr Yadav to lodge the report.\n\n“Mushtaq sir and his family were completely shaken over what happened to him... Yesterday, I went to Bijnor and filed an official report on his behalf,” said Mr Yadav on Dec 11.\n\n“We have proof of the flight ticket, the bank accounts and even CCTV footage near the airport. He also recognises the neighbourhood and the house where he was kept. I think the police will surely get the culprits soon.”\n\nKhan’s kidnapping nightmare comes on the heels of a similar incident where comedian Sunil Pal, who had travelled to Uttarakhand for an event, was abducted on the way back. He was later released in Meerut.\n\n“Pal claimed he was abducted when he had gone to Uttarakhand for a show,” a Mumbai Police officer explained.\n\n“When he stopped for snacks enroute, a man posing as a fan pushed him into a car. While they sought Rs20 lakh, Pal said he was released after he managed to pay Rs8 lakh which he collected from his friends.\n\n“No arrest has been made and further investigation is underway.”\n\nMeerut Police are now investigating if there is a connection between the two kidnappings.\n\nMr Yadav voiced concern about the two celebrities going through a similar ordeal.\n\n“It is shocking that two public figures had to go through a similar ordeal. We hope there is awareness and protection in the future for everyone,” he said.\n\nComedian Sunil Pal\n\n“Mushtaq sir and his family were completely shaken over what happened to him...

My nephew is turning four, he’s a bright young child, but I don’t see him getting a rating of 1500 anytime soon,” Carlsen told news agency Press Trust of India.\n\n“It is very impressive. Most of all, (Anish should) try to enjoy it as much as he can. Don’t think about ratings, results, titles and so on. They will come automatically; just do what you love.”\n\nAnish’s story has gone viral thanks to ChessBase India, which documented his extraordinary journey.\n\nIt published several videos of the boy demonstrating advanced concepts such as the smothered mate and the classic double-rook sacrifice checkmate.\n\nAccording to The Times of India, the young prodigy took his first steps into tournament play by scoring an impressive 5 out of 11 in a rapid event, where he also played against India’s No. 1 and world No. 4 Arjun Erigaisi.\n\nAnish made his classical debut at the West Bengal under-nine Championship last month when he faced opponents up to six years older than him. He scored a stunning 5.5 out of 8 and finished 24th among 140 players. Two of his wins came against rated players.\n\nHe played in another tournament for children under 13 years a week later and fulfilled the minimum score required for obtaining a FIDE rating.\n\nHis mother told The Times of India that Anish’s chess journey started almost a year ago, before his third birthday. “We introduced him to different YouTube channels, including cartoons like Peppa Pig, but he was drawn to chess videos.”\n\n“By January, his interest had grown, and he would watch those videos endlessly. I bought him a chessboard and pieces, thinking it was safe for him to handle even if I couldn’t supervise him closely. He was good with numbers and had learnt to count.”\n\nThe toddler has now been put in a special group led by Indian grandmaster Dibyendu Barua.\n\nSaid Barua: “We’ve put him in a special group where he trains for seven to eight hours. Sometimes, he even comes to my home to play, and once he sits down at the board, he doesn’t get up. His focus is truly astounding.”\n\nHis parents emphasised that they never put any pressure on their son but just want to support his passion.\n\nAnish’s emergence comes as India witnesses an exciting era in chess, with young talents like Erigaisi, R.

Just three days back, on Dec 4, the kebaya, a traditional women’s garment popular in South-east Asia and an integral part of Chitty Melakan culture, was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nMs Jamuna Rani Pillay, 63, secretary of PICMAS, said: “Our great-grandmothers and grandmothers used the baju panjang, almost similar to the kebaya but with a longer top. Now, Chitty ladies wear the present-day kebaya.”\n\nThe celebratory feast was laden with diverse Peranakan dishes from the Chitty Melaka cookbook titled Heritage Food Of The Peranakan Indians: In A Chitty Melaka Kitchen, published in late 2023.\n\nThe spread was prepared by home chefs within the community and AllSpice Institute’s Chef Anup Kumar. On the plates were Peranakan delights such as kueh pie tee (crispy golden shells filled with turnips and carrots) and Chitty Melakan specialities such as roti jala and rendang.\n\nThough steeped in Peranakan ancestry, there was a novel twist to the food served as well – veganism.\n\nChef Anna Eio, the trainer at the AllSpice Institute with Peranakan roots herself, explained the reason for the unique adaptation: “Earlier in the day, the AllSpice Institute hosted Dr Jane Goodall, renowned chimpanzee expert and zoologist, for lunch. She is an advocate for veganism. Hence, together with the Chitty Melakan Association, we decided to give our dishes a vegan touch.”\n\nThis meant that vegetable balls were used for the rendang dish, instead of chicken or beef. The kueh pie tee shells, which usually contain egg, were replaced with pani puri shells.\n\nIn a similar bid to bring Chitty Melaka culture to the youth, 28 students from St Joseph’s Institution and Jurong West Secondary school also launched an online virtual gallery about the Chitty Melaka community and its heritage.

It’s not a big deal to gather a crowd in India. You bring a JCB for construction and crowds will gather automatically. So it’s not a big deal getting a crowd in Bihar,” he said.\n\n“In India, there’s no connection between gathering a large crowd and quality.

He pays a monthly rent of just $1 for the stall.\n\nPhotos: T. Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nWith more than 270 stalls housed on the second level of Block 335 in Smith Street, the Chinatown Complex Food Centre resembles something of a maze.\n\nIn fact, organisers of a scavenger hunt may well use the place in tasking participants to find Kook@Chinatown – a stall selling Indian-style mutton soup.\n\nMany would fail the test. I almost did when I arrived there on a random Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe stall, run by Singaporean Ng Khai Choon, exists on the perimeter of the hawker centre – far from the Michelin-rated chicken rice and char kway teow stalls in the centre of the labyrinth, where long queues snaked in between tables packed with diners.\n\nThough the row housed a dozen units, only six were open and running during the busy lunch hours.\n\n“The footfall here is very bad,” said Mr Ng. “The hawker centre is great – it’s the biggest in Singapore – but the visibility for the corner stalls is very low. People don’t even know you exist.\n\n“And because there are so many good food options here, if you’re new, few people would give you a chance.”\n\nMr Ng, 57, isn’t complaining too much though. After all, his monthly rent costs just a single dollar – as he brazenly advertises at the front of his stall.\n\nHe won the tender in September 2023, and has been operating the stall since January.\n\n“Basically, how it works is, if the stall has been in the tender process for months without bids, I will recce the place to see if it meets my criteria. This stall is near my home, it’s the ideal size and is quite airy. So I placed a bid for $1 and got it,” he explained.\n\n“I don’t want to overbid, so the whole idea is to bid low and take my chances; see if it works out.”\n\nAs a result, Mr Ng, who ran an advertising firm in his 30s before selling the business to a big corporation, sees fit to run his stall for just two hours a day twice a week – on Saturdays and Sundays, from 11am to 1pm.\n\nDuring the week, he runs another stall, selling the same dishes, at Hong Lim Food Centre, also in Chinatown. For that stall, his rent is a little higher than $1.\n\n“Actually if I had bid $1 for the Hong Lim unit, I would have got it,” he said with a laugh. “But I didn’t want to be in the news – too many stores for $1, people might question. So I bid for $44 – that was the stall’s unit number.”\n\nKook@Chinatown sells just four dishes – aloo gobi chapati, lentil soup, mixed salad and mutton ribs soup. Save for the latter, everything else is vegan.\n\nThe mutton soup ($8.50), which came with six tender pieces of rib meat, reminded me of mulligatawny soup – a Tamil dish comprising lentils and rice. This version, of course, came without rice.\n\nUnlike typical versions of mutton soup found at prata joints up and down Singapore, Kook’s version is yellowy, almost like it’s made with a lentil base. The best part about it is the choice of spice level – mild, spicy and very spicy. I chose spicy and was greeted with a welcoming kick of heat on the first slurp. It was, in a word, delicious.\n\nIf you’re like me and put a premium on the quality of the meat, then Kook’s mutton soup ranks supreme. The meat could be prodded off the bone with a gentle nudge of the plastic spoon, and unlike other Indian mutton soup dishes, the meat here is as fresh as they come.\n\n“It’s another reason why I open just two days a week,” said Mr Ng, who says he makes a profit of about $1,000 each month. “So that I don’t have to serve frozen meat.”\n\nBut what inspired a Chinese lad like yourself to make this dish? I ask.\n\n“I love mutton soup – both the Indian and Chinese versions; I eat it all the time,” replied Mr Ng, who cites the soup at Upper Boon Keng Road Food Centre (Haji M. Abdul Rajak) as his favourite.\n\n“About 12 years back, I tried different versions of the dish in Singapore, and sad to say, it’s not very consistent. Some days the meat is tender, some days no. So basically, I wanted to make my own perfect version.\n\n“It was all through trial and error. I’ll taste it, then add this and minus that. Luckily, I’ve got great taste buds.”\n\nOn each day, Mr Ng prepares enough ingredients for just 10 bowls – the same goes for his Hong Lim branch. Though he also takes pre-orders on occasion.\n\n“If someone was helping me, I could open for more than just two days a week and two hours each day. I’ve tried looking, but it’s difficult. For 10 months, I hung up a ‘Help Wanted’ sign,” said the hawker who explained that hawker stall workers must be citizens or PRs – they can’t hire cheaper labour from overseas.\n\n“We do get help from the government. For instance, a hawker can terminate a lease with just one month’s notice, unlike coffee shop leases that are usually binding for three years.\n\n“There are also grants like the energy efficient grant (for chillers and freezers) and the hawker productivity grant that reimburses 70-80 per cent of equipment purchases.\n\n“Most importantly, I enjoy the job.”\n\nHis $1 monthly rent term is only for two years. In 2026, the National Environment Agency will re-look the premises and dictate the new rental rate.\n\nSo if it increases to say, $300, would you continue with the stall? I ask.\n\n“No, I’d rather bid for another stall for $1.”\n\nMr Ng runs his stall for just two hours a day twice a week – on Saturdays and Sundays, from 11am to 1pm.\n\nPhotos: T.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Fan Zone at the World Chess Championship in Sentosa was buzzing with activity on Monday, with several events going on simultaneously.\n\nDiehards from different countries at the Equarius Hotel took part in rapid chess games, and learnt – from an interactive booth – about the strategies employed by past world champions.\n\nSingapore’s five grandmasters – Tin Jingyao, Wong Meng Kong, Wu Shaobin, Kevin Goh and Siddharth Jagadeesh – also made an appearance, taking part in a question-and-answer session and pitting their wits against amateurs in friendly match-ups.\n\n“I would say the Fan Zone in Singapore is much more vibrant compared to the 2023 World Chess Championship in Astana,” said Kazakh chess player and FIDE (International Chess Federation) lead instructor Akhmet Ishmukhamedov. “There are so many activities for fans to enjoy.”\n\nOn each day since the World Championship started on Nov 25, up to 500 fans have watched the intense battle between China’s reigning champion Ding Liren and India’s wunderkind Gukesh Dommaraju at the Equarius’ playing hall. They can see the action through a one-way glass panel with the players enclosed in a sound-proof room.\n\nOften, there is little action, as the contestants take time to contemplate their next move. On those occasions, it has been the Fan Zone which has kept the spectators energised and enthused.\n\n“The parallel activities have been well chosen, and that is one of the reasons why this World Championship is one of the best organised,” said veteran Spanish journalist Leontxo Garcia, who has been covering most major chess tournaments since 1983. “The venue is very good and the conditions for the players are excellent.”\n\nChessBase India journalist Abhyudaya Ram, who has covered several international tournaments, agreed: “Choosing Singapore as the venue was a good idea as it has superb facilities. The organisers have put in a lot of effort, including getting Google as the sponsor, which has elevated chess’ profile.”\n\nGrandmaster Goh, who is also the CEO of the Singapore Chess Federation, said he has been happy with the spectator turnout, but said it was important for him the “people enjoyed themselves”.\n\n“They are having a good time, as there has been a fair bit of tension and excitement,” he said. “For many, the experience has been unique, with so many side events.”\n\nHowever, not all have been thrilled by the quality of play shown by Ding and Gukesh. It has been a ding-dong battle – with the pair tied at 6.5 points on Wednesday with one game left to play on Thursday. If the scores are still tied at its end, the contest will go into a tie-break today.\n\n“This does not look like a game between two World Championship contenders. It looks like maybe the second or third round of an open tournament,” five-time world champion and world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen said in a podcast after Ding and Gukesh were tied 6-6 after 12 games.\n\n“You have to make it difficult for your opponent. That’s when mistakes happen. If you play like the way (Gukesh) played today (in Game 12), it is very easy for the opponent to play near perfectly and win.”\n\nGoh said he too was surprised by the overall low quality of play, with both Ding and Gukesh making mistakes and letting each other off the hook on several occasions.\n\n“If you compare these games with those between Magnus and Vishwanathan Anand, or Kasparov and Kramnik, the quality of play in the past was undeniably better. As an organiser, I might offend a lot of people by saying this, but I want to be objective,” Goh said. “Ding and Gukesh are strong players, but the way they are playing, it is not reflective of their strength.”\n\nLeontxo admitted the games have not been of a high level, but attributed it to “special factors”.\n\n“Ding is showing a lack of confidence; he probably is yet to recover fully from the mental health issues he’s been having for the last one and a half years,” said the Spaniard, who has been a chess writer for the respected El Pais daily since 1995.\n\n“Gukesh is good at calculating variations, but at 18 he is very young. It’s clear he lacks a deep understanding of overall strategy and must work harder.”\n\nFor Singapore’s youngest grandmaster Siddharth, 17, however, Gukesh has done very well.\n\n“The games have been much closer than people have expected because Ding has raised his game and has  been pushing hard for wins” said Siddhrath. “Both have been making mistakes, but that is understandable as there’s a lot pressure since the time control has been shortened.”\n\nAkhmet too believes that it has been a good contest. “The statistics show that the accuracy of their moves is higher than 95 most of the time,” he said. “So they are playing like machines. That was certainly not the case in Astana last year when Ding and his Russian opponent Ian Nepomniachtchi blundered often. Ding eventually won but the chess was not of high quality.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/89386617ffa4a21058c42e5bf1d4e2cbf75b171f527c281b8fe10f4e2285b74d?w=825", "alt_text": "India’s Gukesh Dommaraju signing autographs."}]}

It will also not be served during any public function or in any public place,” he added.\n\nThe Assam Cattle Preservation Act of 2021 bans cattle slaughter and the sale of beef in areas where Hindus, Jains and Sikhs are in majority, and within a 5km radius of a temple or satra (Vaishnavite monastery).\n\nThe opposition All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) hit out at the state government, accusing it of diverting attention from key issues.\n\n“The state government has failed to carry out development works... it has failed to tackle unemployment. There are major issues in the education and health sectors... they are simply diverting the people’s attention through such decisions,” AIUDF legislator Aminul Islam said.\n\nThe Assam Cattle Preservation Bill was passed in the Assam assembly through a voice vote in August 2021, amid a walkout from the Opposition, who wanted the legislation to be sent to a select committee for a detailed discussion.\n\nViolations of the provisions of the bill could lead to imprisonment of three to eight years and a fine between R3 lakh ($4,800) and Rs5 lakh.\n\nMr Sarma’s announcement comes days after he slammed the Congress for alleging that the BJP distributed beef to win elections in the Muslim-dominated area of Samaguri. The chief minister even said he was ready to ban beef in Assam if state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah writes to him, seeking it.\n\n“Amid the sadness of losing Samaguri, (five-time Congress MLLA) Rakibul Hussain said one good thing, that eating beef is wrong. He said it was wrong for Congress-BJP to win elections by offering beef to voters,” Mr Sarma said when asked about the Congress leader’s reported comment.\n\n“I want to know if Congress was winning Samaguri by offering beef to voters. He knows Samaguri very well. Does it mean that Samaguri can be won by offering beef?”\n\nSeveral states in India have already enacted laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows and the sale and consumption of beef.\n\nDelhi has banned the slaughter of agricultural cattle, including cows, calves, bulls and bullocks, while Gujarat bans even the transport and sale of the meat.\n\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkand and Maharashtra all have similar laws. In Jammu and Kashmir, the slaughter of cows and their progeny is punishable with penalties of up to 10 years in jail.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e5765ccc94fd0ae2948cd6615e70efa814514fad892e2ba9c389b652dd60d10e?w=825", "alt_text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma."}]}

This score places Krish in the top one per cent of the most intelligent people in the world, UK-based news outlet Metro reported.\n\nKrish has demonstrated exceptional abilities, reading fluently by the age of four and solving complex maths problems from a young age. He is also a member of Mensa, a society for high-IQ individuals known for its social connections.\n\nKrish excels in extracurriculars as well. In addition to acing all his recent (primary school) exams, including securing a perfect score in mathematics, he is set to join the prestigious Queen Elizabeth’s School.\n\nHe expressed excitement about starting at his new school, hoping it will provide a better challenge for his abilities.\n\n“The (primary schools) exams were too easy,” Krish said, when asked about his academic accomplishments. “Primary school is boring, I don’t learn anything. All we do is multiplication and write sentences all day. I like to do algebra,” he said.\n\nKrish’s parents Mauli and Nischal, both engineers, noticed his abilities when he was four years old.\n\nMs Mauli, who works at an IT firm, recalled: “The things he was doing when he was just four were far above what a four-year-old should be able to do. He could read fluently, his spelling was really good and he had always loved and been good at mathematics. I remember just before he turned four, he sat with me for three hours and completed an entire maths book. He was doing decimal divisions at the age of four.”\n\nIn addition to his academic achievements, Krish is also an accomplished musician. He has won awards as a pianist and has been inducted into the Hall of Fame by Trinity College of Music after completing four grades in just six months. He currently holds a grade 7 piano certificate.\n\nKrish has excelled in several musical competitions in London, often outperforming older contestants. He can recall and perform complex musical pieces from memory, without the need for sheet music. “I don’t get nervous about performing my music at these competitions because I know I’m not going to mess up,” he said.\n\nIn his free time, Krish enjoys solving puzzles and crosswords and is a fan of the TV show Young Sheldon.\n\nHis list of merits also includes being a young chess prodigy. His parents, recognising his talent, arranged for him to have a chess teacher, a player with an impressive FIDE (International Chess Federation) rating of 1600.\n\nDespite only playing chess for four months, Krish has already managed to defeat his coach.\n\nKrish recently shared his excitement with The Sun about being accepted into Mensa. He revealed that his IQ surpasses even Einstein’s. Mensa uses the Cattell III B test to assess reasoning and mental agility, with scores above 160 indicating genius-level intelligence.\n\n“It’s a challenge raising a child who is intellectually so advanced,” Mauli told the tabloid, reflecting on how the parents have embraced their son’s God-given talent. “He’s always asking questions, but then it’s a pure pleasure because when you see a child so young doing things so brilliantly, you realise it’s a gift,” she said.\n\nKrish also has a twin sister named Keira, who is also blessed with intelligent genes. When he’s not studying or practising, Krish relaxes by spending time with friends. Next year, he’ll be attending Queen Elizabeth School in Barnet, one of the top state schools in the country. Keira has also been accepted into four grammar schools.\n\n“Primary school is boring, I don’t learn anything. All we do is multiplication and write sentences all day.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFor more than a year, Singaporean stand-up comic Sharul Channa has been trying to break into the Indian market.\n\nNow she has roped in her husband Rishi Budhrani, also a noted local stand-up comic, in a bid to make a bigger impact there.\n\nThe duo, who have dubbed themselves “Asia’s funniest couple”, will perform together at the Underground Comedy Festival in Bengaluru on Dec 14 and in Chennai on Dec 19.\n\nSharul will also have solo shows in Bengaluru on Dec 15 and at the National Centre for Performing Arts in Mumbai on Dec 27.\n\n“There is really no other way to grow, especially after Malaysia banned me from performing there,” said Sharul. “The Indian comedy scene, on the other hand, is growing fast. The reach is bigger, there is more money, and I want to establish a base there with Rishi.”\n\nSharul, 37, was scheduled to perform her Just Joking! stand-up show at PJ Live Arts theatre in Petaling Jaya on May 18. But following several police reports on one of her videos from 2018 – which is said to have touched on race, religion and royalty –  her work visa was cancelled by Malaysia’s Ministry of Communications two days before the event.\n\nIn March last year, Sharul, known for her sharp, fearless humour and character-driven performances, was listed to perform in six Indian cities – Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Vadodara.  But she received a lukewarm response, and two of her shows were cancelled.\n\n“It was disheartening given the effort I put in,” she said. “But I learnt my lesson. I understood that I needed a social media presence in India. So, over the past several months, I put out a lot clips of my performances on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.”\n\nAccording to Sharul, the move worked, as her number of followers on those platforms have “exploded” since. On Instagram, for instance, her followers have grown from 5,000 to more than 200,000.\n\n“You need to adopt the right strategy for India,” she said. “Singapore is very old school, it’s all about how local you keep your jokes. But, for India, you have to be more international. They normally don’t like the white comedians but are okay with Indian-Singaporeans telling their stories.”\n\nIt also helps that there are only a few female comics in India.\n\n“I have to be well-prepared because the people in the south are well-educated and culturally vibrant,” said Sharul, who has gained popularity in South-east Asia with hit shows such as Pottymouth, Disco Sheela and Saree Not Sorry.\n\n“But in the north, they prefer Hindi. So, I will be speaking in Hindi. I also know a few words of Tamil which I will employ in Chennai.\n\n“In India, if you talk about them, they like it. But they are also very advanced and have a different perspective of things. So, you have to be innovative and cater to topics they like.”\n\nRishi, 40, who has been performing in India since 2018, is “super excited” to do a “double headliner” there for the first time.\n\n“Having grown up in Singapore, I felt like a bit of an outsider in India,” he said. “I now want to reconnect with my roots. I am going with a changed perspective. I will be talking more about the Indian heritage and the connections among Indians.”\n\nRishi was born in Singapore after his parents moved here from Mumbai and Jaipur in the 1960s and the 1970s respectively.\n\nThe comic has previously performed in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Gurugram. This time he is looking forward to performing in Chennai.\n\n“In the north, the Hindi-speaking comedians are more popular,” he said. “It was difficult to match up to them. But in the south, English is more accepted. So, I’m well-prepared.\n\n“I am aware of what needs to be done. But it remains to be seen how I will be received.”\n\nRishi has a good fan base in South-east Asia, but believes he has to expand it to be more successful and enduring.\n\nRishi and Sharul made an impression in Cape Town a few months ago. They believe that can do the same in India this month.\n\n“It will be the best preparation for the Rishi and Sharul Show we will be staging at the Esplanade on March 21,” Rishi said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a4ee43f231898f1a6014afdab54594a74aa1b0ea8d8afdcce546ac7bba49a66b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Fleeing anti-Indian persecution in the 1970s, the family first moved to Canada and later settled in the US.\n\nMr Patel, born in New York, grew up in Queens, completed his schooling there, and attended college in Richmond, Virginia. He later received a Certificate in International Law from the University College London.\n\nNow retired, his parents divide their time between the US and Gujarat.\n\nCommunity leaders told The Times of India that the Patel family maintain a low profile despite New York’s large Gujarati community.\n\n“His father initially ventured into the motel business before working in the private sector. There is little record of the family participating in major gatherings,” said a community member.\n\nThe community members said Mr Patel’s appointment will put a sharp focus on Indians in the US.\n\nMr Patel previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor. During his stint as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes, he was instrumental in leading the House Republicans’ probe into the FBI’s 2016 investigation into contacts between Mr Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nLater, during Mr Trump’s first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned Mr Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Mr Trump and Ukraine without authorisation. Mr Patel denied those allegations.\n\nAfter Mr Trump left office in January 2021, Mr Patel was one of several people he designated as a representative for access to his presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration officials who claimed, without evidence, that Mr Trump had declassified all of the records in question.\n\nHe was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection with the probe.\n\nAs a private citizen, Mr Patel wrote a book called “Government Gangsters” which Trump in 2023 declared would be used as a “roadmap to end the Deep State’s Reign”.\n\nIn his 2023 book Government Gangsters: The Deep State, The Truth, And The Battle For Our Democracy, Mr Patel lays out his case against what he refers to as “the deep state” – an amorphous term he says includes elected leaders, journalists, Big Tech tycoons and “members of the unelected bureaucracy” – calling for “a comprehensive housecleaning” of the Justice Department, which he claims has protected high-ranking members of the Democratic Party while unjustly targeting Republicans and their allies.\n\nMr Trump has praised the book as a “blueprint to take back the White House and remove these gangsters from all of government”.\n\nWhile Mr Patel’s work life is widely known, information regarding his personal life has been less accessible.\n\nHe is not married despite some reports that he tied a knot in a “secret” Hindu wedding.\n\nSeveral years ago, Mr Patel participated and then left a charity bachelor auction that included several of his colleagues after a blogger pointed out that his Florida practice licence seemed outdated, the New York Times reported.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c54d955e5dd4bbb7a582bff30e478b05d7ba07c9cb38efba5e027698ebffe1bc?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel."}]}

Her late grandfather M.K. Narayanan was a prolific local writer and producer of more than 1,000 radio, TV and stage plays.\n\n“Many of the Tamil stories available were either archaic or just translations of western tales lacking the vibrancy of local culture,” Ms Vidhya told tabla!\n\n“I was inspired by my grandfather and the way my parents nurtured my sister and I. Language was always given importance and I always wanted to write a book.”\n\nWith the help of the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism, she launched her three-part book titled Lalitha – about a young girl navigating her childhood in Singapore – on Nov 16.\n\n“I used to read the Lalitha Saraswathi Namam – a Hindu religious text – with my dad everyday. The name struck when I was naming the character and the books,” she said.\n\n“Juggling a full-time job while working on a book was not easy,” added Ms Vidhya, who works in human resources.\n\n“I didn’t include English translations for the stories as children might be inclined towards reading them in English. The Tamil language is my identity. Though my mum is a Malayalee, I grew up speaking in Tamil and I want the next generation to treasure the language.”\n\nThe book does have a multiracial touch, however, in the form of the illustrations, which was done by the author’s Chinese friend.\n\nThe first book in the series is about Lalitha’s favourite hangout spot – the Bird Paradise, while the second and third books are on an MRT adventure and Lalitha’s love for sarees, respectively.\n\n“A snippet of my childhood can be found in all three books. I used to visit the birdpark very often with my grandparents and I wanted to bring it back to life in this book,” said Ms Vidhya.\n\nThe three books are available at national libraries islandwide, and are regarded as reading resources for pre-school children as well.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c4594390b242e583bd8faa32bf90d789abe5463046bfbd2bda3cb453f9175b7b?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Vidhya Nathan."}]}

The fund has set aside $500,000 for The Foundry’s occupants to access over the next two years.\n\nThe three-storey building, which served as the ELD office building for nearly 27 years until 2021, was rejuvenated in less than eight months and repurposed as a collective impact hub.\n\nOccupying more than 17,000 sq ft, it includes office spaces for organisations of varying sizes, hot-desking areas for small start-up non-profits, discussion pods and meeting spaces to foster collaboration and facilitate impactful conversations.\n\nIt features a 100-seat event hall for hosting town halls and events with key stakeholders, and a 40-seat training room that will host masterclasses and learning sessions for occupants.\n\nAt the launch of The Foundry on Nov 28, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam spoke about the founders of social impact organisations: “Founders are different from staff and employees. They’re driven by a cause.”\n\nHe said the founder mindset “is that of spotting a problem, usually looking for a problem, challenging the status quo of what is possible and finding a solution to make things better”.\n\n“We need that founder mindset as well in the social sector... The Foundry should never lose that spirit.”\n\nThe Foundry, set up with donations totalling more than $10 million contributed by private philanthropists, foundations, individual donors and corporations, aims to eventually house 24 social impact organisations.\n\nAfter a two-year pilot programme and operating from a temporary office in Bugis, Mr Narasimman expressed his appreciation for the current venue, which embodies the “kampung spirit”.\n\n“Now, because we are right next door, we can just go up and talk to one another,” he said, adding that he hopes his organisation will benefit from the pooled resources offered by the new hub.\n\n“Majurity pulls in resources and funders who are interested in supporting organisations doing good work. It is also helping us to upskill by giving us communication training – how to talk to funders and how to run a campaign, for example. Therefore, there is learning taking place.”\n\nMr Mohammed Narish, 25, a youth mental health advocate and para-counsellor with Impart, also expressed his happiness with the arrangement.\n\n“Having our own space makes us feel more comfortable and efficient. There are meeting pods and small spaces for us to hold meetings.”\n\nHe also shared how Ray of Hope, a registered charity, which had extra tickets to a sporting event, passed them on to Impart, adding that the close proximity helped facilitate such good-willed gestures.\n\nAs President Tharman said during the building launch: “It will all add up. All these small efforts, founding efforts – some succeed, some don’t – but they will all add up, and they will make this a better society.”\n\nThe Foundry will provide social impact organisations with resources to incubate ideas, co-create and pilot solutions, and build communities.\n\nPHOTO: The Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/557d3a9658ec6f0ecd803739499d330bf80bce0f467437616f807c36b015e1cf?w=825", "alt_text": "Impart founder Narasimman Tivasiha Mani (right) with mental health advocate Mohammed Narish."}]}

The tournament is part of the Singapore Chess Festival, held in conjunction with the ongoing Fide World Championship.\n\nThe national championships featured 692 participants, including 566 from Singapore and players from India and China, among others.\n\n“It really means a lot because it’s the national championships,” said Satvik, who won seven and drew two of his games at the tournament.\n\n“I was the runner-up last year, so there was definitely more motivation to win this year so I just practised harder.”\n\nChess is not just a passion in the Kapoor household – the game has also been a source of comfort as the family weathered some tough times.\n\nA decade ago, Satvik, who was then six, was diagnosed with leukaemia.\n\nRishi, an IT professional, said: “It was completely shocking and devastating for us because we never had a cancer history in our family. The journey taught us a lot of lessons like to never give up and that there’s always hope.”\n\nThe couple learnt of his condition after they discovered bruises on his body while he was nursing a fever. They initially thought he had suffered them during a fall, but checks at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital revealed that his platelet count was very low and his white blood cells were multiplying abnormally fast.\n\nSatvik began chemotherapy and was eventually cleared of cancer two years later. It was during his treatment that a trip to India inadvertently kick-started the Kapoors’ obsession with chess.\n\nDuring that visit, Satvik played chess with his cousins. When the family returned to Singapore, his parents approached the Singapore Chess Federation to seek proper training for him.\n\nWithin his first year, he was beating more experienced players.\n\nHis enthusiasm for chess spread to his family members, with his younger brother Tanush also picking it up, while Shomita went into coaching.\n\nRishi, 48, said: “It became a passion for us. We travel the world, and wherever the chess tournaments would happen we would take him. So that diverted his mind more into the sport.”\n\nAside from Satvik’s U-20 title, Singapore’s chess players also emerged triumphant in eight other categories at the five-day age group championships.\n\nIndia claimed the girls’ U-12 and U-14 trophies, while China was first in the girls’ U-8.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/02592671d98d0d97090ec4222f1b39ce25ab18025df760174bc7a03726f65f5d?w=825", "alt_text": "(From left) Shomita, Tanush, Satvik and Rishi Kapoor at the 2024 National Age Group Chess Championships on Nov 28."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIt’s been tough going for Sivasangari Subramaniam since people began to hail her as Malaysia’s new squash queen from earlier this year.\n\nThe 25-year-old earned her spurs by winning the singles and team golds at the Hangzhou Asian Games in 2023.\n\nAt the London Squash Classic in April this year, she beat three top-five players – Nour El Sherbini, Nele Coll and Hania El Hammamy – en route to claiming the title, becoming the first Malaysian since 2015 to win a gold-level or higher Professional Squash Association Tour event.\n\nA month later, she cracked the top 10 in the world rankings, making her the first Malaysian to do so since former world No. 1 Nicol David retired in 2019.\n\nBut two major losses over a week last month has somewhat derailed her plans to crack the world top five.\n\nOn Nov 17, she lost to Egyptian teen prodigy Amina Orfi  8-11, 11-9, 12-10, 8-11, 11-6  in the Malaysia Squash Cup final. Then, on Nov 23,  she lost to the same player in the semi-final of the Singapore Squash Open.\n\n“Of course, there’s a lot of pressure playing top level squash,” Sivasangari told tabla! “Then there’s added pressure playing at home – I just try not to think too much about it.”\n\nSivasangari, who started playing squash at age eight, felt the matches against Orfi could have gone either way.\n\n“I’m ranked ninth in the world. she’s tenth. So, obviously, I’m the favourite to win,” said Sivasangari. “But those were close matches. I didn’t get the win at home, but I’m proud of the way I handled it. Even making it to the final was a big thing as there were several top players involved.”\n\nThe Malaysian believes there is nothing wrong with the way she is playing. It’s just that on any given day, any player in the top 10 can emerge the winner. For example, she pointed to the Singapore Open final, where Orfi beat world No. 3 Hania 9-11, 11-9, 11-13, 11-1, 11-9.\n\n“There are obviously small details I need to change, but not really my technique,” said Sivasangari. “I have the skills. It’s just the game plan that I need to tweak.\n\n“It’s always a learning curve, even if you’re one of the best in squash. I can learn from every match.”\n\nSivasangari, who is based in the United States, still takes tips from David Palmer, her coach at Cornell University in New York from where she graduated.\n\nWhen she’s home, she trains under Malaysia’s head coach Ajaz Azmat.\n\n“I also have a psychologist and performance trainer,” said Sivasangari. “So, there’s a team behind me that’s helping make me a better player.”\n\nSivasangari, who was born in Sungai Petani, Kedah, started playing squash under the influence of her older brother. “We used to do everything together,” she said. “But after high school, he went to study in London and started working. Squash soon became recreational for him.”\n\nHer family, especially parents Subramaniam Kaniappan and Valli Nagappan, played a key role in her recovery when she was involved in a life-threatening car crash near Kuala Lumpur in 2022. Despite life-saving surgery, her head, spine and neck were badly injured and doctors feared she might never walk again.\n\n“When I was in hospital, I used to worry about what my squash future would look like,” she said. “Over a couple of months, I had two surgeries, and then I was in rehab for a couple of months. I had to get back mobilisation on my neck, which was fractured.\n\n“It was tough. I fully recovered after only a year or so.”\n\nSivasangari said her Hindu faith helped her overcome the doubts.\n\n“I believe in God and pray a lot,” she said. “I do come from a very religious family; my dad goes to India almost every year to do prayers. Whenever I get the time, I go to temples.”\n\nHaving broken into the top 10, Sivasangari knows that the hardest part now is to rise even higher. “There’s more pressure playing the lower rank players now. If I get upset about losing, I can’t move on. So I’m trying to get into the mentality that every tournament is teaching me something.”\n\nHer sights are on the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, where squash will make its debut at the quadrennial Games.\n\nShe also wants to make it clear that comparisons with eight-time world champion Nicol are futile.\n\n“Nicole is a legend of the game. She’s achieved a lot in her career. I don’t think I would want to be compared with her,” said Sivasangari. “Everyone’s unique in their own way. Making comparisons will only make you doubt yourself even more.”\n\nSivasangari Subramaniam\n\nPhoto: Singapore Squash", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/89c6303e080365364a1c638352599f673b6a9b4b43e4c66db3f548a0c223ad4f?w=825", "alt_text": "Sivasangari Subramaniam"}]}

The overwhelming crowd led to suffocation and panic, creating a stampede that injured several people.\n\nMs Revathi, a resident of Dilsukhnagar, had attended the event with her husband Bhaskar and their two children. According to police reports, she collapsed during the chaos and was administered CPR by bystanders and police before being rushed to the hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.\n\nHer son, who was also caught in the commotion, was transferred to a super-specialty hospital and remains in critical condition.\n\nOfficers reportedly used mild force, including a lathi (long baton) charge, to manage the situation.

Another plus is the high-octane action sequences, meticulously choreographed to perfection.”\n\nThe film is creating waves not just in India but also in foreign countries.

Santosh Kumar\n\nManoj Bajpayee could easily be one of the richest actors in Bollywood, given the wealth of talent he possesses.\n\nBut the 55-year-old has largely eschewed commercial cinema and carved a niche for himself as a method actor famous for unconventional roles.\n\nLast week, he was in Singapore promoting the film The Fable at the Singapore International Film Festival. In the 1980s drama set in North India, he plays Dev, a soft-spoken patriarch grappling with mysterious fires that threaten his tranquil existence.\n\n“I don’t know how I choose my roles, but all I would say is that there is some calling when you are choosing a role,” he told tabla! during an interaction at the Raffles City Convention Centre. “It starts with the script, which has to be good. But sometimes, you are looking for a new experience.\n\n“So, you go with new directors who have very different ideas about life and cinema. I throw myself into their world and come out as an improved human being and actor.”\n\nYoung filmmaker Raam Reddy’s The Fable is a haunting tale set in the Himalayan orchards of India in 1989.  Peaceful life in the sprawling estate is threatened by a series of incidents, transforming it into a microcosm of larger systematic inequalities.\n\n“When I was offered the film, I was already in a state of mind which is very similar to Dev’s,” said Bajpayee. “It was not Dev who was dealing with the issue, it was Manoj Bajpayee who was dealing with it – because my life was no different from the protagonist that Raam Reddy wanted me to play.\n\n“So I understood Dev, his conflict and the inner battle. The director’s first film (the 2016 Kannada film Thithi) also completely mesmerised me. He is so young, yet he has this amazing ability to tell a gripping story on screen.”\n\nBajpayee has won critical acclaim for his roles in films such as Satya (1998), Shool (1999), Pinjar (2003), Rajneeti (2010), Gangs Of Wasseypur (2012), Aligarh (2016) and Sonchiriya (2019).\n\nHe became a hit after playing a greedy politician in the political thriller Raajneeti. His portrayal of the lead character Sardar Khan in Gangs of Wasseypur, a militant in Chakravyuh (2012), an investigative officer in Special 26 (2013) and Professor Ramchandra Siras in the biographical drama Aligarh further catapulted his fame.\n\nIf he had concentrated solely on more “commercial” cinema, he would have been a mutli-millionaire by now – in the mould of Shah Rukh Khan or Akshay Kumar.\n\n“I have never chased stardom,” he said. “What has always fascinated me is that as an actor I should be able to express myself.\n\n“I was always a very quiet, reserved kid. Acting has always given me that sense of freedom to express myself.\n\n“The advantage of being an actor is that you are able to play different human beings, and through them, you are expressing your own self. So I was never into stardom. I was never into too much money and fame and glory.\n\n“I’m myself. I’m very comfortable roaming a mall with nobody noticing me. I’ve always been that kind of a person.”\n\nBorn in Belwa, a small village near the city of Bettiah in Bihar’s West Champaran district, Bajpayee aspired to become an actor since childhood.\n\nHe relocated to Delhi at 17, and applied to study at the National School of Drama, only to be rejected four times.\n\nBut he was persistent, continuing to do theatre while studying in college.\n\nBajpayee made his feature film debut with a one-minute role in Drohkaal (1994) and a minor role as a dacoit in Shekhar Kapur’s Bandit Queen (1994). After a few unnoticed roles, he played the gangster Bhiku Mhatre in Ram Gopal Varma’s 1998 crime drama Satya, which proved to be a breakthrough.\n\n“You learn the craft of acting through theatre and other workshops,” said Bajpayee. “I’ve done theatre for 10 years in Delhi, and then moved to Mumbai with Bandit Queen. That’s how my journey started, three decades back.\n\n“I’m very much aware that it is difficult for an actor to survive without doing commercial cinema. But I’m very careful of what I do in that genre,” he said.\n\n“I don’t look down upon commercial cinema. It moves and entertains billions of people. So who am I to judge it? It’s just that I feel more comfortable doing artistic cinema, which is exploring the dimension of art in its story.\n\n“The benefit of doing theatre for so long is that you know how to express yourself in all kind of genres. And that is always an advantage for me.”\n\nSo, what’s the limit for Bajpayee, or to what extent can he go?\n\n“I don’t know, I have never thought that this is all I can offer.\n\n“Suddenly, one Ram Reddy comes along, and he pushes you. And then, I myself am shocked that he is able to get another dimension out of me.”\n\n“I don’t look down upon commercial cinema. It really moves and entertains billions of people. So who am I to judge it? It’s just that I feel more comfortable doing artistic cinema, which is exploring the dimension of art in its story.”\n\nManoj Bajpayee", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/70d37c3a5521a788d33b5057817126e9f5b929d46e69d1d9e1bea0ee1c9560a6?w=825", "alt_text": "Actor Manoj Bajpayee."}]}
