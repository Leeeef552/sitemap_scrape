Karthikeyan\n\nகி. ஜனார்த்தனன்\n\nIn the 1960s, when she was a teenager, Madam Dorasamy Radabyee would often notice a quiet, lanky Chinese guy at her home.\n\nMr Richard Ho would often show up at her mother’s home in Tiong Bahru to visit Doraisamy Vetrivel, his childhood friend and Rada’s brother. Though they didn’t interact much at the time, the two would often exchange glances and smiles.\n\n“Looking back, I think he came so often to our house just to see me,” said Madam Rada, 73, with a laugh.\n\nThe fifth of seven children, Madam Rada’s father, who worked at Keppel Harbour, died when she was just five, and her mother worked as an orderly at a hospital to raise seven children.\n\nMadam Rada studied up to only Primary 3 in a Tamil-medium school and was unable to read in English. So when Mr Ho, who was 16 at the time, decided to express his feelings for her one day, he penned a one-sentence letter with the simple words “I love you” in Tamil.\n\nMadam Rada, who is a year older than Mr Ho, did not have any feelings for him at the time – but she remembered she was very moved by his proposal.\n\nThings were not straightforward, however. Describing her mother and grandmother as “sticklers for the Tamil culture”, she recalled how her grandmother scolded her for joking that she wanted to marry “either a Caucasian or a Chinese”.\n\nWhen her mother learnt of her daughter’s wishes to pursue a relationship with a Chinese man, she was concerned Madam Rada would encounter racism and ultimately not be accepted by Mr Ho’s family.\n\nBut the young couple were undeterred and courted for years. “I was certain we were meant for each other,” said Madam Rada. “Otherwise, I said we would remain single till the end.”\n\nAfter seven years, Mr Ho’s mother visited Madam Rada’s house to ask her mother for her daughter’s hand in marriage.\n\n“My husband’s father had just passed away due to heart complications. It was his dying wish that his son and I be united in marriage,” Madam Rada said.\n\nChinese custom dictates that if a parent of the groom or bride dies before the wedding, the couple must marry within 100 days of the death or wait a thousand days. The families understandably chose the former. The couple married in February 1974 at the Commonwealth Muneeswaran Temple and again in March at a Chinese ceremony.\n\n“My mother-in-law had five children, including my husband,” explained Madam Rada. “We spoke to each other in Malay. As time went by, she came to understand me better and would happily introduce me as her daughter-in-law to people she knew. She especially loved my Indian-style cooking.”\n\nToday, the couple have two children – both married – and four grandchildren, and the family gets together every Chinese New Year for a reunion dinner.\n\n“During the new year, we have a little game where I hang hong baos onto an indoor Chinese cherry blossom tree. Some packets have $10, some have $20 and some have $50 – so it’s down to whoever is lucky that day,” said Madam Rada.\n\nThe family also observes Deepavali, when everyone dons new clothing, visits the temple and has lunch at a relative’s home. Mr Ho and Madam Rada also give hong baos to their grandchildren.\n\nOver the years, Mr Ho, a rather reserved individual, has embraced the Tamil culture he married into, and although he doesn’t speak the language, he understands it well.\n\nGrowing up in a kampung in Geylang, he had many Tamil friends as a child and has always been a fan of Tamil movies – especially of actor and former Tamil Nadu chief minister M.G. Ramachandran (known as MGR). He even flew to Chennai for MGR’s funeral in 1987.\n\nDeeply fascinated by Indian spirituality, Mr Ho, who works in procurement, has also visited multiple holy sites in India since 1992.\n\n“He is quite a devout man,” said Madam Rada. “He wakes up early and before going to work, lights the altar lamps. We are going to Tamil Nadu in a few months’ time to visit the Palani Murugan and Ucchi Pilliayar (in Tiruchirappalli) temples.”\n\nWhen asked what he thought of his wife, Mr Ho said: “She is a very kind lady, always showing love to children. She playfully calls our grandchildren “amma” (mother) and “appa” (father), which I find adorable.”\n\nMr Richard Ho and Madam Dorasamy Radabyee in front of a multi-faith altar. The couple believe that deities from different religions are all manifestations of one god.\n\nPhoto: P. Karthikeyan\n\n“My husband’s father had just passed away due to heart complications.

The festival attracts tens of millions of devotees every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj.\n\nAs pilgrims rushed to participate in a sacred day of ritual bathing, people sleeping and sitting on the ground near the rivers told AFP they were hit and trampled in the darkness.\n\n“The crowd came like a tornado,” said Ms Maul Devi, a survivor from eastern Uttar Pradesh. “Most of them were young men running towards the bathing area. There was no control, only mayhem. I fell twice with my sister, holding onto her hand as tightly as I could. But then the weight of the falling men broke us apart. She was crushed to death in front of my eyes.”\n\nPilgrim Renu Devi, 48, said: “The crowd fell on top of me and trampled me. When the crowd surged, elderly people and women were crushed, and no one came forward to help.”\n\nRescue teams carrying victims from the accident site weaved through piles of clothes, shoes and other discarded belongings.\n\nPolice were seen carrying stretchers bearing the bodies of victims draped with thick blankets.\n\n“Thirty devotees have unfortunately died,” senior police officer Vaibhav Krishna said. “Ninety injured were taken to the hospital.” Mr Krishna’s briefing came nearly 18 hours after the stampede and was the first official death toll given by authorities.\n\nFestivities had otherwise been allowed to continue almost as normal during the day, with millions still trekking to the riverbanks to immerse themselves in the water.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called the stampede “extremely sad” and offered his “deepest condolences” to relatives of those killed. “I wish for the speedy recovery of all injured,” he added.\n\nDozens of relatives were anxiously waiting for news outside a large tent serving as a purpose-built hospital for the festival near the disaster site.\n\nThe six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, with more than 400 million devotees from across the world expected to attend.\n\nThis year’s festival is a Maha Kumbh Mela, with the prefix “maha” meaning “great”. Maha Kumbh festivals are only held once every 144 years.\n\nWednesday marked one of the holiest days in the festival, when saffron-clad holy men led millions in a sin-cleansing ritual of bathing at the confluence of the Ganges, Saraswati and Yamuna rivers in tandem with a planetary alignment in the solar system.\n\nOfficials had attempted to divert crowds away from the disaster site, instructing them to bathe at other locations.\n\nBut, even as news of the stampede spread, crowds pushed through cordons to move towards the river, shrugging off aggressive orders from police to turn back.\n\nOfficials from the Uttar Pradesh government, responsible for staging the festival, said about 100 million people had participated in the ritual bathing throughout the day.\n\nChief Minister Yogi Adityanath told reporters that medical workers were treating those seriously injured in the crush, adding that the situation was “under control”.\n\nIndian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi blamed the disaster on poor crowd control that prioritised the comfort of distinguished visitors.\n\n“Mismanagement and the administration’s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident,” he wrote on social media\n\nPolice this year installed hundreds of cameras at the festival site and on roads leading to the sprawling encampment, mounted on poles and a fleet of overhead drones.\n\nThe surveillance network feeds into a sophisticated command and control centre meant to alert staff if sections of the crowd get so concentrated that they pose a safety threat.\n\n“If you see advertisements, it seems like the government is providing world-class facilities,” university student Ruchi Bharti told AFP not far from the riverbank. “But this stampede proved that was all a lie.”\n\nA public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday, alleging “lapses, negligence and utter failure of administration” on the part of the Uttar Pradesh government over the stampede.\n\nThe petition, filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari, sought directions from the top court to formulate policies and regulations to prevent such tragedies at large religious gatherings.\n\nMr Adityanath has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident.\n\nAFP\n\n“Mismanagement and the administration’s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.”\n\nIndian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/73f99239c7dd83e328ecde2d47914bf90a6c6e2515cce6a157f6ec31da66a13b?w=825", "alt_text": "A devotee who was caught in the stampede."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTo Mr Atul Temurnikar, the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, which was conferred on him by India’s President Droupadi Murmu on Jan 11 in Bubaneshwar, Odisha, is a recognition of his pioneering efforts in revolutionising the educational landscape in South-east Asia, and in offering world-class learning environments for the Indian diaspora.\n\n“But more than that, the award (the highest honour bestowed upon overseas Indians for their exceptional achievements) is a motivation for more people to come forward and do that extra legwork for their communities,” said the chairman and co-founder of Global Schools Foundation (GSF) Singapore, which runs four schools here and 60 more in 10 other countries including India.\n\n“There are around 35 million people of Indian origin living outside India, and not only them, but all communities need support. There are people who are underprivileged, people who do not have access to education, and that is where a lot of work needs to be done.\n\n“Also, it’s a clear signal to the younger generation that, while they pursue their own dreams, they should also contribute to society. By helping somebody, or a group, they are playing an important role in lifting the community.”\n\nMr Termunikar, 60, who was born in Nagpur, Maharashtra, and graduated in engineering, did exactly that when he was posted to Singapore by technology giant HCL in 1991.\n\nDuring his 10 years with HCL and later IBM, he learnt that most children who came to Singapore from India were admitted to a lower class because of a dichotomy in the education system, and this was creating problems for parents.\n\nWhile Singapore has a Cambridge derivative, India has its CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) syllabus. Mr Temurnikar saw the issue as an opportunity to make a difference.\n\nIn 2002, he quit a high-paying corporate job to start Singapore’s first international school designed for Indian expatriates along with his wife Aparna.\n\nThe Global Indian International School (GIIS) at Mount Sophia offered students an education that bridged Indian values with global standards and blended the best of the Singapore and Indian systems.\n\nParents welcomed the school with open arms, finally finding a solution to their children’s educational struggles, and the GIIS brand took off. Today, more than 45,000 students of some 70 nationalities study in its schools.\n\n“My initial thoughts were to take a two-year break from IBM and later put the venture on autopilot with a professional management team. But, as things progressed, I realised that education cannot be outsourced,” said Mr Temurnikar. “It has to be handled with your own mind, heart and soul.”\n\nMr Temurnikar quickly understood that he had to build a good team for it to succeed. “Our staff choices were purely skills-based,” he said. “We judged them on how they could contribute and whether they could take up leadership roles. Moreover, they had to be independent and innovation-driven. Fortunately, we got the right people, some of them have been with us for 20 years.”\n\nLike all businesses, GSF faced several hurdles too. But Mr Temurnikar saw those as opportunities to do things in a different way: “We were always thinking about what could go wrong, and coming up with solutions.”\n\nThe focus was on making education innovative and accessible, and GSF introduced the CBSE-i curriculum, an international version of India’s national syllabus. It also developed a quality system called “7S Analysis” to ensure consistent standards across its campuses. This framework evaluates everything from infrastructure to teacher performance, ensuring each school meets the foundation’s high expectations​.\n\nMr Sudhir Dhar, an IT professional whose son goes to GIIS, ranks the school among the top international schools in Singapore. “It has a strong academic and co-curricular programme which gives children a well-rounded development,” Mr Dhar said. “Its educational philosophy aligns with our family’s values and approach to learning.”\n\nOver the past 20 years, mostly children of expats have benefited from GSF’s learning programmes – but it has also contributed towards promoting education among the underprivileged.\n\n“We have to charge a fee as we have to deliver certain basic frameworks,” said Mr Temurnikar. “But I wouldn’t call GIIS expensive. We are midway between the low-end schools and the most expensive. We make sure the school fees are in the affordable range.”\n\nThis year, GSF will add two new campuses in Japan, in addition to the five it already has in the country.\n\n“We have seven campuses in India and two in the UAE, and we are in discussions with a few more governments to set up our schools in different cities,” said Mr Temurnikar. “The advantage for us in this endeavour is the Singapore brand name that we carry. Parents and students know we deliver high-quality education. That’s how we have created massive loyalty in the world markets.”\n\n“The advantage for us in this endeavour is the Singapore brand name that we carry.

Social media users soon gave Moni the nickname “Mona Lisa”.\n\nHowever, Moni was forced to return to her hometown of Indore in Madhya Pradesh after the sudden fame hampered her ability to earn a living.\n\nSocial media users were particularly drawn to her striking amber eyes, sharp nose and dusky complexion. She drew widespread admiration, which adversely impacted her ability to earn a living.\n\nRather than purchasing garlands, crowds and social media influencers flocked to her stall, only to click selfies and videos.\n\nOne video showcased the nuisance that was created when a large crowd of men gathered at her stall to take photos and videos of her.\n\nThe video, which has since garnered over 2.3 million views, also shows Moni’s family protecting her from the crowd as she covered her face with a scarf.\n\nThe chaos prompted Moni’s father to take the difficult step of sending her back to her home city.\n\nAccording to the Free Press Journal, her increasing fame decreased sales in her business.\n\n“People were after Moni all the time,” her younger sister Vidya told Republic World. “It became difficult for her to sell garlands. Our father decided it was best for us to go home for now.”\n\nAddressing the issue, Congress party’s Karnataka general secretary Lavanya Ballal Jain wrote on X: “How disgusting are Indian men? A poor family from Madhya Pradesh goes to the Kumbh to sell garlands for a living, but the sinners who went to wash away their sins became so fascinated that the family had to leave the area.”\n\nThe videos have not stopped. One clip shows Moni complaining about people spreading rumours that she has earned millions after going viral – when the reality is not the case.\n\nIn another footage, she jokes that she would take photos only with those who bought her garlands.\n\nOn Tuesday, Moni shared a video on her Instagram of her cutting a birthday cake while people around her sing “Happy Birthday”.\n\n“Thank you so much for all your love for me,” she wrote in the caption.\n\nHer Instagram profile has nearly 200,000 followers.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5494f69f3bb5a0ffc45712f7adfe81173400eaeb6d799631adbaca2d03c212a7?w=825", "alt_text": "Moni Bhosle."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nOn Jan 16, when more than four million people took a holy dip at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, one among them was a Singaporean.\n\nContent creator Avi Dixit was fulfilling a wish that about 400 million people from around the world are having this year.\n\nHindu devotees believe that taking a dip in the waters at the confluence of the sacred rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati during the Maha Kumbh, or Great Pitcher Festival, that occurs every 12 years, would deliver salvation from the cycle of birth and death, in addition to the absolution of sins.\n\nThis year’s Maha Kumbh, which started on Jan 13 and ends on Feb 26, is extra special because the sun, moon, Jupiter and Saturn are in alignment after 144 years.\n\n“It was incredible to take a dip at the world’s largest religious festival because there are thousands doing it with you and the atmosphere is electric,” said Mr Dixit, who is also a member of the Singapore cricket team.\n\n“I’m the only one in my family who has had the privilege to do this. Obviously, it means a lot to wash your sins away. The experience itself and how it was managed was unbelievable.”\n\nUsually, during the Maha Kumbh, millions of people jostle daily to take a dip in the “Triveni Sangam”, the confluence of the three rivers. The 25-year-old received “special treatment” as he was flown to Prayagraj as a guest of India’s Ministry of External Affairs.\n\n“They reached out to me on Jan 1,” said Mr Dixit, who was born in Delhi but moved to Singapore in 2011 with his parents and brother. “I was like yeah, absolutely. I was selected because I have a large social media following in South-east Asia and globally, and the MEA wanted me to help people know about what’s happening in India.”\n\nMr Dixit, who has played cricket at the South-east Asian Games, Asian Games and in World Cup qualifiers, has 520,000 followers on Instagram, 1.4 million on TikTok and 500,000 on YouTube. He went to Prayagraj along with 20 content creators of Indian origin from 10 countries, including Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji and Mauritius.\n\n“It was a 20-minute boat ride to the Triveni Sangam. It was very cold (9 deg C), but the water actually felt a bit warmer. Even then, only five from our group took the dip,” said Mr Dixit, who studied politics, philosophy and economics at Yale-NUS.\n\n“The water was waist deep, and the rule is you either dip three times or seven times. I chose to do it three times. I spent a solid 10 minutes at the Triveni Sangam.”\n\nMr Dixit said the experience was a refreshing one, “because so many people around you are doing the same thing, and they’re all enjoying themselves”.\n\n“I felt rejuvenated. A lot of people were praying loudly... it was a surreal experience.”\n\nIn all, Mr Dixit spent 21 hours at Prayagraj, during which he also visited two akharas (religious centres that are the custodians of spiritual practices and rituals at the Maha Kumbh).\n\nA mix of religion, spirituality and tourism like no other in India, the Maha Kumbh, is a test in crowd management for authorities as the visitors stay in more than 150,000 tents set up across 4,000 hectares, or the size of 7,500 football fields.\n\nMr Dixit, who also visited Odisha as part of the MEA tour, said the organisation was excellent.\n\n“From the airport to the Tent City,  a one-hour drive, the journey was seamless,” he said. “The security was good, and the Tent City itself was like a five-star resort, with a TV, heater, chairs, two beds and bathroom facilities.\n\n“As you drive across the bridge that leads to the Maha Kumbh grounds, you see rows and rows of tents on both sides of the river... it’s unbelievable.\n\n“It’s also no joke that 400 million people will be at the mela. It shows the power of religion, the power of people coming together for an event.”\n\nMr Avi Dixit (right) with local officials at the Maha Kumbh Mela.\n\nPhoto: AVI DIXIT", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b3b3b659e55e30f048df6738f815ed75b7d3e07e11959b6f8f71b7f4290d9005?w=825", "alt_text": "Content creator Avi Dixit after his dip at the confluence of the sacred Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh."}]}

This was in 2009.\n\nTwo years later, despite kicking the habit, the damage had seemingly been done. Mr Lakshmanan, now 65, was diagnosed with rectal cancer.\n\nShortly after, doctors found that he also had testicular cancer.\n\nBecause of the rectal cancer, he had part of his bowel removed. A permanent stoma bag was attached to his abdomen to help him remove body waste.\n\nPrior to Mr Lakshmanan’s cancer diagnosis, he was active in sports like swimming and squash. But he also smoked, drank and was overweight.\n\n“A lot of people ask when they get diagnosed, why me? In my case, it was more like, why not? Because I checked all the boxes – an unhealthy lifestyle, high stress levels, smoking two soft packs a day (40 sticks), and both my parents died of cancer.”\n\nThe stoma bag, an appliance connected at the end of his colon to an artificially created opening in his abdomen, proved particularly challenging, especially when he had to get out of the house.\n\n“It wasn’t so much of a social stigma for me,” Mr Lakshmanan told tabla! “It was more about how I was going to get back to living life normally. I didn’t really care what people thought.\n\n“Things took a turn for me when I saw an article in the papers, about a man in his 70s with a stoma, playing basketball, running, cycling, swimming. I mean, if he can do all that, then so can I, right?”\n\nIn the years since, Mr Lakshmanan has lived a life perhaps more active than most 30-year-olds – brisk walking, kayaking, dragon-boating, line-dancing, zumba and even a full-marathon.\n\nMost notably, in 2018, he along with 19 others, embarked on a gruelling four-day trek through the Gobi desert. The following year, he was one of two cancer survivors to trek through northern Mongolia in freezing conditions. Both trips were meant to raise funds for the Singapore Cancer Society (SCS).\n\nWhat was particularly difficult for him right after his diagnosis was the lack of emotional support for patients like him. “I was in the wilderness for about a year. I relied a lot on the Internet to look for people who had gone through the same journey,” said Mr Lakshmanan, who is married with no children.\n\nHis wife, who is two years younger, has been a pivotal pillar of support to him over the years. She herself, however, struggles with rheumatoid arthritis, a lifelong condition that can be debilitating if it isn’t well managed.\n\nTo improve things on the support front for cancer patients, in 2014 Mr Lakshmanan co-founded the Ostomy Association of Singapore, which looks into the needs of people with stoma bags.\n\nAside from his full-time job running a security services company, he is actively involved in Relay For Life, a global movement that raises funds for cancer treatment, and serves as the coordinator for the Cancer Can Give movement, which aids cancer survivors in giving back to society. He is also the vice-chair of the Semi-Colons, an SCS support group for colorectal patients.\n\nFor his volunteer efforts, he received the annual President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Award last November. This is an addition to no fewer than six other awards he bagged over the years, including the Singapore Cancer Society Outstanding Volunteer Award in 2018.\n\n“For cancer patients, there’s nothing like speaking to someone who has walked the journey that you’re about to,” said Mr Lakshmanan. “They’d look at you and think to themselves, ‘hey, I might be okay’.\n\n“The year that I went through without any support, I don’t want others to go through the same thing. There is lots of help around, there are many people who are willing to hold your hand and walk the journey with you.”\n\nMuch of his volunteer work has led him around the world – from Doha to Madrid to Colorado in the United States.\n\n“Last year I travelled more than I ever did. I also visited Belgium with my wife and went to Busan for a dragon boat race. Next up, hopefully skydiving,” he said with a laugh.\n\nWhen asked what makes him most happy, his reply was typical of most Singaporeans – food. “In particular, char kway teow, with the cockles.”\n\nHe added: “Before I was diagnosed, I was just like any regular person going to work, paying the bills, dealing with stress. But I think after the diagnosis, I’ve had a lot of time to reflect.\n\n“You know the two most important days in a man’s life? The day he’s born, and the day he finds out why.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7518b000c53ff06421eba3660ab66083c9394551d02dffb04a6ebefea5020cf4?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Ellil Mathiyan Lakshmanan, who had rectal and testicular cancer concurrently."}]}

With each note I played, the intrusive thoughts grew quieter, until there was silence.”\n\nOpera-trained for four years, Thaarmin is also proficient in the piano, ukulele and guitar. “Music has always been my language. It’s how I express what words can’t.”\n\nIf pursuing a music career hasn’t been challenging enough, Thaarmin, who hopes to pursue a degree in music at LASALLE College of the Arts, said he has faced racism from people online.\n\n“On TikTok, many people hide behind anonymity and spew hate comments targeted at the colour of my skin. Even when I go live, where I’m mostly just singing covers, people make slurs or make stereotypical remarks about Indians. These comments are never relevant to the content I’m sharing, which is what frustrates me the most,” he said.\n\nHe recalled a particularly painful experience when he posted a TikTok video of him performing a cover of Sabrina Carpenter’s Espresso.\n\n“People said things like, ‘This gives Little India vibes,’ or ‘Which dormitory open house is this?’ It’s disheartening to see that people fixate on the colour of my skin instead of the art I’m presenting.”\n\nThaarmin credits his family for their support through his mental health struggles as well as their encouragement towards his musical endeavours.\n\n“My brother taught me discipline and resilience, and my parents always encouraged me to chase my dreams, even if they were unconventional,” said Thaarmin, whose older brother, Thiruben Thana Rajan, 25, is a national athlete,\n\nThaarmin is set to release his debut EP (extended play; a musical recording that contains fewer than eight tracks) on Feb 14. Featuring seven songs – all written, composed and sung by him – the EP fuses his R&B and pop influences with his Tamil roots.\n\nWhile he hopes to produce a full-length album soon, he has already begun penning songs for a second EP in the second quarter of this year.\n\n“I want to keep growing and learning. I’m open to working with a label or a team, but for now, I’m focused on finding the right distribution,” he said.\n\n“I want to represent my community and show that we belong in spaces like this. For the most part, it’s amazing how encouraging people have been, especially considering how young I am.”\n\n“When the noise in my head got too loud, my hands naturally reached for the piano.

He could barely walk.\n\nIn a video widely circulating on the Internet, Kambli is seen being helped by his wife Andrea Hewitt and friends.\n\nThe former model and fashion enthusiast, who is Kambli’s second wife, showed commendable patience and strength in handling him.\n\nThis was not the case a few years ago when Andrea accused Kambli of domestic violence, claiming he hit her with a frying pan. She moved out with their children, Jesus Christiano and Johanna, but the pair appear to have reconciled.\n\nOn and off, Kambli has been in the news for appearing drunk in public and abusing people.\n\nLast October, he drew attention when he struggled to get off his bike in Mumbai. He had to be helped off it by passers-by. Later, he appeared very weak at the unveiling of the Ramakant Achrekar (Tendulkar and Kambli’s coach) memorial in Mumbai.\n\nIn November, he revealed that he was treated at three different hospitals for a severe urinary infection. He later said he was on the road to recovery, and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the doctors for saving his life.\n\n“I am alive because of the doctors here (Akruti Health City Hospital in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra),” he said. “All I would say is that I will do whatever (the doctor) asks me to. People will see the inspiration that I’ll give them.”\n\nKambli was once a star in the making and rose to prominence along with Tendulkar in the 90s. Before that, while playing together for their school in 1988, the duo scored a record 664 runs – the highest partnership for any wicket in any class of cricket.\n\nBut while Tendulkar went on to become the “god” of cricket, Kambli got more involved in off-field issues, which led to his downfall.\n\nKambli made his India debut in 1991, but it wasn’t until 1994 that he made a splash with consecutive double centuries in Tests.\n\nHe smashed 224 against England in Mumbai and followed it up with another marathon knock of 227 against Zimbabwe in Delhi. However, his temptation for the bling stood between him and the road to success.\n\nHe last played a Test in 1995, even though he averaged 54 in the format. Kambli continued to play ODIs till 2000, making nine comebacks. But, despite all his efforts, the batsman’s career ended abruptly at just 28 years of age.\n\nKambli continued to play domestic cricket for Mumbai until announcing his retirement in 2009. He did a few films in between and appeared on a few reality shows, but neither stint lasted long.\n\nHe formed cracks in his relationship with Tendulkar the same year when he said his former teammate could have supported him more and saved him from his indiscipline and downfall. Later in 2013, however, Tendulkar reportedly paid all the hospital bills when Kambli underwent surgery after suffering two heart attacks.\n\nKambli’s financial condition hasn’t been well for a long time, with the former cricketer surviving on the Indian cricket board’s (BCCI) monthly pension of Rs30,000 ($470).\n\nIndia’s 1983 World Cup-winning team, including Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar, have offered him help, but on the condition that he undergoes rehabilitation for his alcohol addiction.\n\nHis friend and former first-class umpire Marcus Couto has said Kambli has already undergone 14 rehab programmes.\n\nDr Vivek Dwivedi, who has treated Kambli, said the former cricketer needs not just rehab, but close monitoring.\n\n“He needs rehabilitation, for which he will need money; a good physiotherapist, good nutritional support and speech therapy, as there is some slurring,” said Dr Dwivedi, adding that Kambli also faces memory loss.\n\nVinod Kambli being helped by his wife Andrea Hewitt at a Wankhede Stadium event; (above) Kambli and Sachin Tendulkar (right) during their early playing days.\n\nPhotos: @viralbhayani/ Instagram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ad5349740c636a3d083cba3412586725bace5a2e1a3531cfbbe80946a3fb7062?w=825", "alt_text": "Sachin Tendulkar (right) and Vinod Kambli during their early playing days."}]}

A piece of the knife the intruder used was removed from his body. He was discharged on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the hospital, Saif suffered six injuries in the attack, two of which were deep cuts. Doctors said he was leaking spinal fluid when he arrived at the hospital. However, none of his injuries were severe.\n\nOn Sunday, police arrested Shariful, a Bangladesh national who changed his name to Vijay Das.\n\nPolice said Shariful entered the residential building with the intent of burglary. He claimed he was unaware of who Saif was and targeted the house as he thought it belonged to someone rich.\n\n“He was driven to crime because of extreme poverty,” a police officer told the Times of India. “He chose Saif’s residence randomly. Shariful lost a housekeeping job at a Thane (a city in Maharashtra) restaurant on Dec 15. He found himself nearly penniless.”\n\nPolice said Shariful entered India by crossing the Dawki river on the India-Bangladesh border at Meghalaya, paying Rs10,000 to an agent to take him to Assam. He then stayed in Kolkata for a while before moving to Mumbai.\n\nAfter losing his second job in the city, Shariful decided on committing a burglary, and surveyed locations across the ritzy parts of Bandra and Khar on Dec 31 and Jan 1. Before the attack on Saif, Shariful walked 90 minutes to Bandra on the night of Jan 15.\n\n“He carried housebreaking tools like a screwdriver, hammer and hacksaw blade, which he bought a few days before,” a police officer told The Times of India. “The knife that he used in the attack was stolen from the Thane restaurant where he used to work.\n\nPolice said he stabbed Saif on his back many times to free himself from the actor’s tight hold.\n\nShariful gained entry into Saif’s 12th-floor flat in the Satguru Sharan building through the bathroom window. “After he entered the house, the actor’s staff spotted him and started arguing with him. Soon, Mr Khan came there and sensing a threat, he held the accused tightly from the front,” the police officer said.\n\n“The accused started stabbing Mr Khan in the back to free himself.”\n\nAccording to the officer, Saif swiftly locked his flat’s main door, believing Shaiful was still inside. But the burglar escaped by retracing his entry route through the bathroom window.\n\n“The accused then came down and hid himself in the garden of the building for around two hours before fleeing the area,” said the officer.\n\n“After the crime, he was in Bandra-Khar for hours before taking a train to Dadar. He was unaware till then that he had stabbed a famous actor. He told us during questioning that his attack on Saif was unplanned.”\n\nPolice tracked down Shariful after the Thane restaurant owner provided his Worli location and phone number.\n\nShariful said during questioning that he was a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and had tried to scale the walls of the actor’s Bandra bungalow to get a look at the superstar before the Saif incident.\n\n“He said his friends and family members often told him that he looked like Shah Rukh Khan. That would puff him up,” the police officer said.\n\n“He was unaware till then that he had stabbed a famous actor. He told us during questioning that his attack on Saif was unplanned.”\n\nA police officer speaking to the media", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e49582dbde70b7deb7b06f052df3b0ea5e83235431325ba6de461d02fa6d9845?w=825", "alt_text": "Bangladeshi national Shariful Fakir (left) was arrested on Sunday over a knife attack on actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary."}]}

He is also renowned for composing the music to many of the movies which elevated actor Rajinikanth to “superstar” status in the 90s.\n\n“The concert was truly one-of-a-kind and extraordinary,” said Mr Arumai Chandran, chairman of 8 Point Entertainment. “We selected Deva for his status as an iconic figure, and his performance was bound to evoke a sense of nostalgia among the fans who have cherished his music for many years.”\n\nAnuradha’s soulful rendition of Karuppu Thaan Enakku Pudicha Colouru was a highlight of the evening, as was Mano’s energetic performance of Naan Autokaran, a Rajinikanth classic that had the entire hall dancing and singing along.\n\nDeva’s own performances were equally impressive, with songs like Kavala Padathe Sagothara and Vitha Vithama Soappu Seeppu Kannadi earning a rapturous applause from the crowd.\n\nConcert goer R.

Carole Ann still recalls the fateful morning in September 2018 when a searing pain in her womb jolted her awake.\n\nUnder immense and increasing pain, she called for an ambulance to take her to hospital, where she learnt from doctors that a cyst in one of her ovaries had ruptured, causing her to go into septic shock.\n\nShe was in an induced coma for two months, during which time her lungs collapsed, her kidneys stopped working and her heart stopped at least twice.\n\nMs Carole – who was intubated and spent more than four months in the intensive care unit – was given inotropes, a class of drugs used to treat patients with acute heart failure or septic shock. They saved her life but also turned her limbs gangrenous.\n\nShe resisted amputation for as long as she could, but finally had parts of all four limbs severed in August 2019.\n\nFollowing the amputation, Ms Carole, now 47, said she took a while to get over her grief.\n\n“Back then, if I had a choice, I would’ve lied down, rolled over, and just closed my eyes and did nothing,” she said. “Perhaps if I was 60 or 70 years old, I might have done that. But I was only 40.”\n\nToday, the quadruple amputee – her hands, just after the wrists, and her legs, below the knees – is determined not to deny herself the best that life has to offer.\n\nCurrently a service quality officer at an IT firm, Ms Carole started working from home four years ago. Just before that, she had to learn how to use a keyboard and a smartphone without fingers – a larger-sized keyboard cost around $130, and an orb-shaped mouse was customised for her hands.\n\n“I guess I would say that I’m lucky because I have also lived the life of an able-bodied person, and I understand how we sometimes take things for granted,” she said.\n\n“And now, as a disabled person, I fight to do what able-bodied people can do easily.”\n\nAs she got used to her new life after a couple of years, Ms Carole began volunteering at Human Capital Singapore, which trains people with disabilities in HR roles such as payment, recruitment and scholarship administration. After being trained, they get work experience within the company, before being deployed to small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nHer volunteer efforts towards disability awareness led to her becoming a recipient of the Goh Chok Tong Enable Awards in 2023.\n\nAnd she’s not stopping there.\n\nMs Carole has since tried her hand at acting, and will play a supporting role as a cafe manager in the Mediacorp teleseries Provocative. The episode is set to be aired early this year.\n\n“My story can have continuity, no? Or does it just stop here?” she said with a laugh.\n\n“My advice to others who are disabled: We’ve got to advocate for ourselves. Find a way out, build relationships, and before you know it, you’ll be working and coping with everything. You’ll be surprised.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/783c3994d8882195934af511bd6d9b2c7f637c1dfdc82b4a4da715c887d0f86d?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms D.G.

He is on a five-day visit to India to commemorate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.\n\nஇர்ஷாத் முஹம்மது\n\nSingapore and India are natural partners and Singapore has invested in India’s ‘Viksit Bharat’ ambitions to become a developed country by 2047, said President Tharman Shanmugaratnam after receiving a ceremonial welcome at the Indian president’s official residence, Rashtrapati Bhavan, in New Delhi.\n\nMr Tharman is on a five-day state visit to India to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nHis motorcade was received by a procession of riders on horses and gun salutes, as he was welcomed by Indian President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe Indian government’s Viksit Bharat @2047 vision aims to turn India into a developed economy with a GDP expanding from $3.4 trillion to $30 trillion by 2047.\n\nMr Tharman emphasised the importance of exploring opportunities in the digital space, with particular focus on data sharing and financial collaboration.\n\nOne prospect was the potential establishment of a data corridor between Gift City in India and Singapore. This corridor would enable financial institutions in both countries to exchange data securely and efficiently, fostering greater collaboration in the financial sector.\n\n“Sustainability is a major priority for both India and Singapore,” said Mr Tharman, adding that both countries are exploring renewable energy corridors to enhance energy cooperation, which would further strengthen their shared commitment to combating climate change.\n\n“I am optimistic for our relations with India because our leaders see eye to eye,” he said, adding that the eastern states are a priority for the Indian government.\n\nMr Tharman will be leading a delegation that includes senior leaders from business and academic institutions, representing nine organisations to the eastern state of Odisha as part of his state visit.\n\nThe delegation consists of representatives from ST Engineering, ITE Education Services, Sembcorp Industries, Keppel, Capitaland, Surbana Jurong, PSA India, Energy Research Institute @ Nanyang Technological University and Global Finance & Technology Network.\n\n“We go with our eyes open to learn as much as we can and see where there can be fruitful opportunities for collaboration,” Mr Tharman said.\n\nHe will also visit the World Skills Centre in Odisha, a place he said has “great promise” and which holds “special significance among the eastern states”.\n\n“The people (of Odisha) are hungry. They have got natural advantages and natural resources,” he said.\n\nAs part of his visit, he met around 200 overseas Singaporeans living and working in India on Jan 15. Speaking to them at the reception marking Singapore’s 60th year of independence, he said we need to understand the opportunities in different parts of India – because there will be opportunities for Singaporeans to add value with their skills and experience wherever they go.\n\nAnd in engaging with India’s diversity, do so with mutual respect, he said, adding, “Whatever we do in India, do it with some humility”.\n\n“This is a continent that has its own deep history, depth of culture, and they’ve got ways of doing things that we can learn from as well – so it’s a two-way learning relationship,” Mr Tharman said.\n\n“When we as Singaporeans, businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals and individuals, engage with India, we’ve got to appreciate and immerse ourselves in India’s diversity. That’s a tremendous strength of India, and we’ve got to get to know it.”.\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam receiving a guard of honour at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi.\n\nPhotos: The Straits \nTimes, REUTERS\n\nMr Tharman speaking with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as India’s President Droupadi Murmu and Mr Tharman’s wife Jane Ittogi walk alongside.\n\nREUTERS", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a8c6e5decfa1f5921ded03a5b3e9845997b88289ba2d7f2ce33b0b2b6d7ed472?w=825", "alt_text": "President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his wife Jane Ittogi laying a wreath at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial in New Delhi on Jan 16.

He was appointed CEO in November 2021, after having served as acting CEO for eight months.\n\n“It has been a privilege to serve as the chief executive officer of the International Cricket Council and I am incredibly proud of the results we have achieved, from enhancing the global reach of cricket to the commercial foundation put in place for ICC Members,” Allardice said in a statement. “I believe this is the right time for me to step down and pursue new challenges.”\n\nThe official ICC statement made no mention of the exact reasons for Allardice’s departure, but a source told PTI  that his ouster had been on the cards for a while.\n\n“The T20 World Cup in the US was a big flop in terms of playing conditions and it also exceeded its budget... the auditing is still being done,” the board member told PTI.\n\n“What broke the camel’s back was the Champions Trophy, where as CEO, he was supposed to give a clear picture about the readiness of Pakistan to host a tourney of such magnitude.”\n\nThe Champions Trophy is due to start on Feb 19 with India playing its share of matches in Dubai owing to security concerns in Pakistan.\n\nBut the bigger concern for the ICC is that tournament venues in Karachi and Rawalpindi are still partially under construction or renovation, and the images that have come from there do not paint a positive picture.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Pakistan would be ready for the start of the marquee event, which features the world’s top eight teams and is being held for the first time after 2017.\n\nHowever, ICC chairman Jay Shah praised Allardice for his contribution to the game.\n\n“On behalf of the ICC board, I want to sincerely thank Geoff for his leadership and commitment during his tenure as chief executive.

Kejriwal has blatantly lied. The AAP convener should immediately tender an apology,” the Haryana chief minister wrote on X.\n\nMr Kejriwal, though, was not convinced. He claimed that the Haryana chief minister “pretended to drink Yamuna water... and then spat the same water back into the Yamuna”, and accused him of wanting Delhi people to drink “poisonous” water.\n\nMr Kejriwal wrote on X: “When I said that the Yamuna water could be dangerous for the lives of Delhiites due to ammonia contamination, they threatened to file an FIR (police report) against me.\n\n“They want to make the people of Delhi drink the same poisonous water, which they themselves cannot drink. I will never let this happen,”\n\nThe controversy originated from Mr Kejriwal’s remarks on Monday, when he accused the Haryana government of “poisoning” the Yamuna water supplied to Delhi, claiming it could have caused mass fatalities.\n\nMr Kejriwal said: “If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide.”\n\nMr Saini said that as soon as the issue cropped up, teams from the World Health Organisation as well as the Central Pollution Control Board and other agencies collected samples.\n\n“All the samples were found to be in order. No traces of poisonous substances were found,” said Mr Saini.\n\nHe then accused Mr Kejriwal of running away from his own responsibilities, claiming the AAP leader was looking for an escape route under the garb of misleading statements.\n\n“He has spent 10 years telling lies. The way he has insulted the people of Haryana by giving such statements is not acceptable. As far as the water is concerned, it is all safe,” Mr Saini said.\n\nThe Congress party too slammed Mr Kejriwal, with leader Rahul Gandhi saying: “Five years ago, Arvind Kejriwal said that he would take a bath in the Yamuna River and drink the water of the Yamuna River. It has been five years, and to date, Kejriwal ji has not drunk the water of Yamuna”.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/25e99859c929f41d9b2c347a182617be24989c7d4431f26e0f5e02f25da8c2fa?w=825", "alt_text": "Haryana CM Nayab Saini drinking from the Yamuna river."}]}

But if you ignore that, it is irresistibly entertaining.\n\nThe first episode, titled after Nagrath’s timeless song Rahe Na Rahe Hum, offers a captivating glimpse into the maestro’s life and work.\n\n“His music and orchestration had a class,” notes singer Sonu Nigam, underscoring the genius behind timeless classics like Jo Vaada Kiya Woh Nibhaana Padega and Laaga Chunri Mein Daag.\n\nThe admiration for the Roshans is evident through the voices of legends, such as late singer Lata Mangeshkar, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali and singers Asha Bhosle and Kumar Sanu, who praise the quartet for their work. As screenwriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar remarks: “They neither blew their own trumpet, nor did anyone else blow it for them.”\n\nThe second episode on Rajesh, the man who gave great melodies, such as Bhool Gaya Sab Kuch and Yaad Nahin Ab Kuch, features a range of interviews, varying in depth and insight, while the third episode on Rakesh offers valuable insights into how the actor-turned-director perceived cinema as a medium to transport audiences to another world: “We take people to a world which they cannot see otherwise.”\n\nIconic Rakesh films like Karan Arjun, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, Koi... Mil Gaya and Krrish are rightfully highlighted – but the series steers clear of addressing instances when his creative instincts faltered.\n\nThe fourth episode, dedicated to Hrithik and titled Koi... Mil Gaya, focuses on his 2003 blockbuster debut and his transformation into India’s first superhero with Krrish. However, it noticeably glosses over his string of flops following Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai and omits any meaningful insight into his personal life.\n\nSometimes The Roshans appear overly dramatic. But overall the documentary, which ranks No. 4 among all Netflix shows in India, provides a heartwarming and nostalgic experience.\n\nRakesh felt the series has done exceptionally well. He told tabla!:  “I am truly overwhelmed by the incredible response to the series. In my filmmaking career, which spans 17 films, I have never received such a wave of positive messages and appreciation. The warmth and love from audiences around the world have been humbling, and it is deeply gratifying to see how the series has resonated with so many.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/adc333c76bd9da0e12068bbbe7d8dd65f377fecc0c3bc24382a7dd7f5cca5cf5?w=825", "alt_text": "(From left) Actor Hrithik Roshan, director-actor Rakesh Roshan and music composer Rajesh Roshan."}]}

When the Olympics happens in India, it will take India’s sport to new heights.”\n\nIndia has sent an expression of interest to host the 2036 Olympics and the Indian Olympic Association is in talks with the International Olympics Committee’s Future Hosts Committee. But this is only the first step in a long and competitive bidding process that will pit India against others such as Indonesia, Chile and Turkey. A final decision is expected only after 2025.\n\nIndia has staged World Cups for cricket and the Asian Games twice, but it has never hosted an event the size of an Olympics. Hence, many are sceptical if India can pull it off.\n\nSports journalist Sharda Ugra told AFP that India has an underwhelming record in staging mega sporting events – apart from cricket –  “because of its governance structure, sporting administrations and paucity of events”.\n\n“So then, is it viable for us to be building large stadiums just because we are going to be holding the Olympics? The answer is definitely no.”\n\nThe 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi was the last time India staged a multi-sport international event. But it was marked by construction delays, substandard infrastructure and accusations of corruption.\n\nSome experts believe the country’s hosting bid is more about the personal ambitions of Mr Modi, who will be 86 in 2036, and leaving his mark on the world stage.\n\n“Hosting the Olympics will, in a way, burnish India’s credentials as a global power,” academic Ronojoy Sen told AFP. “The government wants to showcase India’s rise and its place on the global high table, and hosting the Olympic Games is one way to do it.”\n\nNo city has yet been identified as the potential 2036 Olympics host, but many expect Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar – two cities near each other in Gujarat – to be the front runners. Gujarat is Mr Modi’s home state.\n\nOne of the world’s largest stadiums, the Narendra Modi Stadium – which can accommodate 130,000 people – is situated in Ahmedabad.\n\nIn anticipation of 2036, the Gujarat government has already created a Rs60 billion ($958 million) budget to build six sports complexes in the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar area.\n\nMr Modi has thrown his political weight behind the Olympic bid, calling it “the dream of 1.4 billion Indians”. He assured the IOC in October 2023 that India “will leave no stone unturned in the preparation for the successful organisation of the Olympics in 2036”.\n\nBut critics have warned of the post-Games economic woes of host nations and urged India to instead invest the money in training athletes so they can win more Olympic medals.\n\nSince 1896, when the modern version of the event began, India has won just 10 gold medals at the Summer Olympics; eight of them in hockey alone.\n\nNo one knows how much it is going to cost India to host the Olympics, but it is certain the costs will far outstrip the budget – which has been the case in recent Games, including Tokyo 2020 that cost around $17.5 billion.\n\nEven the Commonwealth Games in 2010, one of the most expensive ever, cost India US$4.1 billion, instead of the US$270 million that was first estimated. Revenue from the Games, on the other hand, was only US$38 million.\n\nMr Jonathan Selvaraj, a senior Indian sports journalist, argues that India’s Olympic bid is a “misplaced priority”, one that focuses more on the public spectacle of hosting the high-profile quadrennial event, rather than actually developing India’s sports ecosystem.\n\nIf the latter is what India wants to achieve, the focus, he said, should be on reforming sports governance at the top – where unqualified politicians still hold power and corruption is endemic – as well as developing grassroots sports infrastructure.\n\n“It’s always been the case that the Olympics takes place in a sort of a mature sports ecosystem,” Mr Selvaraj told the Straits Times. “I cannot honestly say that the Indian sports ecosystem is what we consider to be a mature sports ecosystem.\n\n“When you spend a billion dollars on the Games, surely, there’s going to be some impact, but the question is whether the return on investment is justified.”\n\n“Is it viable for us to be building large stadiums just because we are going to be holding the Olympics? The answer is definitely no.”\n\nSports journalist Sharda Ugra on India’s bid to host the 2036 Olympics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/87862d790eba8ab7479dcad9c85d22b8777ccd229791d3da76670551d6982765?w=825", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami during the opening ceremony of 38th National Games in Dehradun, Uttarakhand."}]}

It was attended by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and around 5,000 residents, who were all treated to a five-minute fireworks display which lit the evening sky green, blue and red.\n\nThe sculpting workshop was part of the National Antiquities Parade, a collaborative art installation featured in this year’s Singapore Art Week x PAssionArts SG60 initiative. Art Week runs from Jan 17 to 26.\n\nSupported by the Mountbatten Community Arts and Culture Club, the installation reimagines the 2006 National Day Parade – the last one held at the old National Stadium.\n\nIt features over 250 clay figurines – representing various contingents of the parade – sculpted at five community workshops by participants from Broadrick Secondary School, Association of the Deaf, Thye Hua Kwan Active Ageing Centre @ Cassia, Waterside Condominium, Dakota Breeze Residents’ Network and Jalan Batu Residents’ Network.\n\nGuided by a team of professional artists from the Temporal Displacement Agency to sculpt miniature soldier figurines, inspired by the Terracotta Warriors of China, the clay sculpting workshops welcomed a diverse group of participants from ages eight to 60.\n\nMs Rukmani, 52, who learnt about the project from a poster in her neighbourhood, had no experience with clay or even the art of sculpting, and said she was initially unsure about the process.\n\n“But once I began sculpting, it felt surprisingly natural,” she said. “There was something deeply calming about working with my hands, shaping the clay and watching it transform into something meaningful.”\n\nSingapore-based Indian-British artist and workshop facilitator Poonam Saksena-Taylor said clay was chosen as the medium due to its simplicity and accessibility, making it ideal for participants of all ages and skill levels.\n\n“We had a young girl who was incredibly skilled and helped the adults, and the seniors, though they faced some challenges with the tools, found their own ways of contributing,” she said.\n\nEach figurine has been engraved with the sculptor’s name at the base to symbolise their individual contribution and connection to the project.\n\nThis personalisation, according to artist Raihan Harun, adds to the installation’s theme of restoring the national spirit.\n\n“We wanted to recreate the feeling of an archaeological excavation,” he said. “The figurines represent elements of our national identity that might have been overlooked but are now being restored.”\n\nAs the next stage of the project, members of the public are invited to “restore” and bring the installation to life by painting the clay figurines at the Singapore Sports Hub Visitor Centre. The painting sessions are open daily from 12pm to 7pm until Jan 26.\n\nThe exhibit, which is free and wheelchair-accessible, will remain on display for a month after Singapore Art Week ends.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7130e224913dd55976dbd63b4290d870f5852d2bc59e05e864a717c8a729641f?w=825", "alt_text": "Mountbatten resident Rukmani Naganathan painting a figurine at the National Antiquities Parade workshop."}]}

It is an ongoing process that takes time, but gradually they will integrate into the local community, he added.\n\n“This is how earlier generations became Indian Singaporeans, and it will happen with this generation, and with new arrivals from other groups and places too,” he said.\n\nThis is how the Singaporean identity can be sustained and enriched, and the way to build a cohesive and inclusive society that is “connected to the world, strengthened and not divided by our diversity”, he added.\n\nSM Lee was addressing around 2,000 guests, including Cabinet ministers, MPs, Indian leaders and volunteers who attended the appreciation dinner at Marina Bay Sands’ Sands Grand Ballroom.\n\nA tribute video was screened, and organisers gifted him intricately designed elephant sculptures as a token of appreciation for his support for the Indian community during his tenure as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2024.\n\nSM Lee said the Indian community has progressed with the nation and made considerable contributions in many fields, adding that while the community may be small, it has played a full role in Singaporean society and worked with other communities to contribute in many ways.\n\n“This shows the success of Singapore’s multiracial model, which has created full and equal opportunities, a harmonious society and better lives for all, including the minority communities,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged the migrants from many parts of the Indian subcontinent – including Tamils, Malayalees, Telugus, Sindhis, Punjabis, Bengalis and Sinhalese – who came to modern Singapore in its earliest days in search of a better future, and who formed part of the Singapore story.\n\n“These different groups sank roots here, formed bonds with one another, and out of this kaleidoscope of backgrounds, there gradually emerged a distinctive and proud Singaporean Indian community.”\n\nSM Lee said the Singaporean Indian community is flourishing, benefiting from the efforts of self-help community organisations, such as Sinda, and the People’s Association’s Indian Activity Executive Committees Council, or Narpani Pearavai.\n\nCheques of $150,000 each were presented to the Singapore Indian Education Trust and Sinda during the dinner.\n\nThe community organisations can do good work because of the strong support of many selfless volunteers, he said, noting that their ranks include those who have moved to Singapore only recently.\n\nSome have become permanent residents or citizens, while others are here temporarily, for school, family or work.\n\nRegardless, they should be applauded for willingly stepping up to volunteer, said SM Lee, noting that this new crop comes from a wider range of backgrounds and places than earlier generations of Indian immigrants.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\n“These different groups sank roots here, formed bonds with one another, and out of this kaleidoscope of backgrounds, there gradually emerged a distinctive and proud Singaporean Indian community.”\n\nSenior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Singapore’s early Indian migrants", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fe1bbf405fbaaa5c2187bb99db795af6775a3876ae308a8373f8e19fea7a9a22?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Indulekha, a volunteer with the Malayalam Language Education Society, with SM Lee during an appreciation dinner on Jan 11."}]}

It hits you like thunder on a clear sunny day – unexpected, loud and definitely not subtle.\n\nAfter my recent trip to Ahmedabad and Mumbai, I’ve come to realise that noise is not just a part of life in India; it is life. It’s like the soundtrack of the nation, playing 24/7 with no volume control.\n\nAhmedabad: Dogs and nighttime serenades\n\nThe Gujarat city welcomed me with undhyu (a mixed vegetable dish), dhokla (spongy snack), kite flying and a nighttime cacophony of howling dogs.\n\nThe stray dogs of Ahmedabad, it seems, have formed their own nocturnal choir. They howled, growled and barked in unison, with a long sustained howl operating as the occasional solo performance. Forget Spotify, I listened to this canine choir every night with eyes wide open.\n\nOut of desperation I lashed out to my friend: “Why don’t those dog squad vans come and collect these mongrels?” There was a hushed silence. “We do not do that here . Animals have a right to live freely too,” the friend said.\n\n“Alamak! While the rest of Ahmedabad slumbered to their lullaby of nocturnal howling, I went barking mad!\n\nMumbai: Honking, yelling and everything in between\n\nIf Ahmedabad is an overture, Mumbai is the full-blown orchestra. Every car honks, not just once, but repeatedly, as if honking is a form of Morse code.\n\nIt’s not just cars – buses, auto-rickshaws and even pedestrians join in.\n\nCrossing the street feels like navigating a minefield where every honk is a warning, a greeting or sometimes just a honk for honk’s sake. Behind trucks is a board hanging “Horn Please OK”! I couldn’t understand that. An invitation to honk?\n\nAnd let’s not forget the people. Conversations in Mumbai are never private. Whether it’s in a crowded cafe or an enclosed elevator, you’ll hear people discussing their children’s grades, Alia Bhatt’s latest blouse cut or stock prices at a volume that could wake up the dogs in Ahmedabad.\n\nWhy so loud?\n\nThe question that haunted me throughout my trip was: Why do Indians speak so loudly? Is it a cultural thing? A survival mechanism in a country of over a billion people? Or are they just making sure everyone within a 5km  radius knows what’s happening in their lives – a sort of precursor to Instagram?\n\nIndians are passionate communicators. Talking isn’t just about words, it’s a full-blown performance. We are not whimsical whisperers, we are ballsy, opinionated, megaphonic proclaimers of the truth!\n\nIn Indian families, everyone is involved in everything. Loudness ensures inclusivity – even the uncle next door knows what’s cooking for dinner.\n\nNoise in India is not seen as a nuisance; it’s a way of life. It’s almost as if Indians have an internal “loudspeaker” switch permanently set to “on”.\n\nOthers blame Arnab Goswami. If you’ve ever watched his show, you’ll know that speaking softly is not an option. Goswami doesn’t just debate, he declaims, ensuring his voice drowns out everyone else’s – even when everyone else is also yelling.\n\nHow do Indians bear it, you ask? Indians are masters of selective hearing. They can filter out the chaos to focus on what’s important – like ignoring the honking to hear the vegetable vendor’s daily deals or tuning out the street noise to catch the latest cricket commentary on the radio.\n\nBy the end of my trip, I was yelling too. At first, it was to be heard over the din. But then, it became second nature. I yelled at auto drivers, yelled to order chai, and even yelled while talking to myself. It’s as if the noise seeps into your soul, turning you into a louder, more assertive version of yourself.\n\nBack in Singapore after my trip, I had to stop myself honking at every signal by clenching my fists and muttering to myself: “Daisy, this too will pass!”\n\nA symphony of life\n\nAs overwhelming as it is, the noise in India has its charm. It’s the sound of life – messy, chaotic and unapologetically loud. It’s the heartbeat of a nation that never stops, never slows down and certainly never quiets down.\n\nFor one, silence is overrated. Noise, in all its chaotic glory, is a reminder that life is happening all around you. It is infectious, invigorating and, dare I say, addictive.\n\nAlso, I’ve learnt to appreciate the art of yelling. It’s not just about volume; it’s about timing, tone and conviction. Indians have mastered it, and honestly, I’m a little jealous.\n\nFinally, I’ve learnt that noise is not just sound; it is emotion. It’s the joy of celebration, the frustration of traffic, and the passion of a cricket fan insisting that Rohit Sharma should give up the captaincy: “Bahut mota ho gaya hai yaar (he’s too fat to be captain).“\n\nIt’s everything that makes India, well, India.\n\nIn quiet Singapore, this perceived loudness might come across as unusual, but it is not ill-intentioned. It’s just the way people connect and bring a little bit of their home culture wherever they go. And let’s face it, wouldn’t life be a little less vibrant without the energetic chatter?\n\nP.S. Slept like a log in Singapore yesterday… AHHH no noise!", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/514ad95e1310a0bb680aec23ff2178298872c1e0d5e59efc4d240478c2c303ff?w=825", "alt_text": "Stray dogs add to the cacophony of Ahmedabad’s streets."}]}

But we must also stand firmly against nativism and xenophobia, and welcome the new arrivals to become part of our extended family.”\n\nAs I read his speech, three things struck me. First, the issue of balance.\n\nBalance, to me, would mean maintaining the equilibrium of interests that has been struck – and must be preserved – between the needs and aspirations of settled Singaporeans and those of arriving immigrants. The balance involves not just raw numbers but also how immigrants affect the employment, educational, healthcare and housing prospects of existing Singaporeans.\n\nSecond, the issue of sustainability. For a balance to be sustainable, it must be upheld by its key stakeholders. For immigrant stakeholders, the key need is for them to not import their ethnic instincts, impulses and affiliations into Singapore. Immigrants owe it to their prospects here to ensure they do not replicate the sharp religious and racial distinctions and practices that they accepted in their home countries.\n\nThis country has struck a fine multiracial and multi-religious balance among its many communities. It is a man-made balance, created by wise leaders and intelligent citizens over decades, that is seen in a range of integrative policies at work across realms that stretch from public housing to national service.\n\nWhat is made can be unmade. Singaporeans simply will not allow arriving foreigners to dismantle, in however small, incremental and seemingly innocuous ways, the architecture of multiracial peace-based economic prosperity that defines this nation.\n\nThis is not to say that immigrants need to cease what they were in their home countries so as to find their place in this host country. Absolutely not. The strength of Singapore is that its social system is integrative but not assimilationist. Had it been so, immigrants would have had to join locals in becoming honorary Chinese because the Chinese form the majority. Indians arriving in Singapore remain Indians.\n\nHowever, arriving Indians in Singapore, like people arriving from anywhere else, would need to understand that they have to become a part of a new national balance. The onus falls on immigrants therefore to not seek to co-opt the balance into old ways of thinking that reflect the imperatives of their original nations.\n\nThird, Singaporeans are the other, and most important, stakeholders in this integrative process. Xenophobia would help no one because Singapore needs people from abroad to ensure its demographic and economic heft. Without that heft, it simply cannot punch above its weight in world affairs. Without that heft, this place would be poorer for all, particularly its citizens.\n\nIt is in that spirit of enlightened self-interest that citizens need to reach out to arriving foreigners to tell them that they made the right choice in coming to Singapore. Some of those citizens, and certainly many of their forefathers, were themselves immigrants once. The same logic of history that brought them here has brought in new immigrants.\n\nThe good news is that immigration and integration are working well on the whole. Since the arrival of Stamford Raffles in 1819 to found contemporary Singapore, proto-Singaporeans and their descendants have developed what are called “habits of the heart” that make it possible for them to see foreigners not as inevitable intruders but as potential neighbours. That capacity has served succeeding generations of Singaporeans well.\n\nThe key point, though, is that foreigners have become Singaporeans. Singapore has not become a foreign land to its own. It is this historical logic that needs to be managed with the utmost sensitivity and caution as newer immigrants seek to make Singapore home.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/community/events/striking-fine-balance-across-communities?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Jaishankar with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nAFP\n\nIn a bid to appease the new Donald Trump administration and show willingness to cooperate with a crackdown on illegal immigrants in the United States, India is planning to repatriate its citizens living illegally in the country.\n\nThis comes amid Mr Trump’s efforts to deliver on his promise of restricting immigration in the US and to deport all those living in the country without proper documents.\n\nSome 18,000 Indians have been identified for deportation, said a report by Bloomberg quoting unnamed sources. However, the exact number of Indians residing illegally or without proper documentation in the US remains unclear, which could potentially add to the figure.\n\nA Press Trust of India report said as many as 180,000 Indians are living illegally in the US.\n\nThe Trump administration’s prompt action on fulfilling his key promise of curbing immigration in the US has all those living illegally in the US and even on temporary visas on edge.\n\nWithin hours of taking office, Mr Trump shut down the CBP One app that facilitated legal entry of immigrants into the US by granting them work eligibility and also abolished birthright citizenship. He also declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border and mobilised troops to restrict entry of illegal migrants.\n\nIndians account for one of the largest diaspora communities in the US. When it comes to the H-1B visa that allows businesses to employ people for specialised jobs, Indians make up a massive percentage. In 2023 alone, Indians bagged three-fourth of the total 386,000 H-1B visas issued, according to official data.\n\nHowever, in terms of illegal immigration, India falls behind the US’ immediate neighbours such as Mexico and Venezuela.\n\nThe reported figure of 18,000 Indians identified for deportation corroborates the numbers shared by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last year. According to data from ICE in November 2024, some 17,940 Indians were among the 1.45 million people slated to be deported. This included individuals with final orders of removal who are not in ICE custody but are awaiting deportation.\n\nThe report also mentioned that India ranks 13th among Asian countries contributing to the number of undocumented immigrants. with China topping the chart with 37,908 people.\n\nOn Wednesday, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, after a meeting with new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirmed that India has expressed its willingness to facilitate the legitimate return of undocumented Indians residing in the US.\n\nHe emphasised that New Delhi is currently verifying the identities of those eligible for deportation, stating that the precise number of individuals cannot yet be determined.\n\n“As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level,” said Mr Jaishankar. “At the same time, we are also very firmly opposed to illegal mobility and illegal migration.”\n\nHe noted that ensuring legal and mutually beneficial mobility is in the best interests of both nations.\n\n“At the same time, I also told Mr Rubio that, while we understand all of this, and I also accept that these are autonomous processes, it is in our mutual interest to facilitate legal and mutually beneficial mobility. If it takes 400-odd days of waiting period to get a visa, I don’t think the relationship is well served by this. He (Rubio) also noted that point,” Mr Jaishankar said.\n\nHe further explained that illegal activities often accompany unlawful migration, which can harm a country’s reputation.\n\n“When something illegal happens, many other illegal activities get joined onto it, which is not desirable,” said Mr Jaishankar.\n\n“It is certainly not good reputationally. So, with every country, and the US is no exception, we have always maintained that if any of our citizens are there illegally, and if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been open to their legitimate return to India.”\n\nIndia’s External Affairs Minister S.

It brought people together, fostering mutual respect and understanding.”\n\nTypically celebrated on Jan 14, Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius to Capricorn, which indicates a new beginning. Communities in India and other countries in South-east Asia offer prayers to solar deity Surya on that day.\n\n“This year, we wanted to portray other harvest festivals as we also have non-Tamils in Mountbatten,” said Ms Aaarti Naidu, chairperson of Mountbatten CC IAEC. “Sankranti is celebrated by different Indian communities in different ways. We wanted our residents to understand that.\n\n“Indians, Malays, Chinese, all got together to celebrate the festival at Katong CC. It was a vibrant atmosphere, with emcee Amataul Jameel Suhani, a Malay, introducing the different harvest festivals and explaining their significance.”\n\nMountbatten CC MAEC vice-chairperson Juriah Naam felt the event was well-organised and thoughtfully set up. “It was a wonderful initiative by the Mountbatten CC IAEC committee to revive the kampong spirit while educating residents about various Indian cultures in such an enjoyable way,” she said.\n\n“The effort put into the decorations was greatly appreciated, especially the village-like displays, which were made entirely from recycled materials. The stage performances were equally entertaining and engaging, with residents thoroughly enjoying themselves, even dancing to the drumbeats. It was heartwarming to see non-Indians actively participating as well.\n\n“We were also given the opportunity to set up a booth to educate residents about Malay culture, where we taught them how to create a bunga manggar (decorative flowers used to mark special and auspicious occasions). The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many actively participating and even successfully completing a few creations.”\n\nMountbatten resident Poh Choo Yap pointed said the event fostered a sense of harmony, free from discrimination among races.\n\n“I strongly encourage organising such events annually to promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation,” he said. “The most meaningful element was the sense of community bonding, as everyone came together to celebrate the spirit of gratitude and abundance.”\n\n“The celebration showed the importance of racial harmony that Singapore holds so dearly.

He replied: “I don’t need to be told what to do or what not to do. So, for now, as I plan to pursue motorsports not just as a driver but as a team owner as well… until the racing season is on, I won’t be signing films.\n\n“I’ll get back to acting probably between October and March – before the racing season commences.”\n\nAjith, a motorsport buff, also said that, though he has taken part in the BMW Asian Championship, British Formula 3 and European Formula 2 races, he couldn’t compete as much as he wanted to due to his film commitments.\n\n“I was 18 when I started racing motorcycles back home, then I got busy with work,” he said. “I got into the film industry, and later, in 2002, when I was 32, I decided to get back into racing. But not in motorcycles, in four-wheelers. I raced in national championships in India before competing internationally. But I could do only a few of them due to work commitments.”\n\nAjith, known for starring in blockbusters such as Billa (2007) and Vedalam (2015), has two films up for release – Vidaamuyarchi and Good Bad Ugly. The former was supposed to be released on Jan 10 for Pongal but was postponed; a new release date has yet to be announced. The latter will be released in theatres on April 10.\n\nLaunched racing team\n\nRecently, multiple videos of Ajith celebrating a third-place finish with his team in the Dubai 24H 2025 race surfaced on social media. Held annually at the Dubai Autodrome, the race features high-performance GT and touring cars competing in a gruelling 24-hour format that tests speed, strategy and endurance.\n\nThe 53-year-old actor, who launched his racing team, Ajith Kumar Racing, in September last year, raced alongside teammates Mathieu Detry, Fabian Duffieux and Cameron McLeod.\n\nIn the practice run, Ajith left fans worried when his car spun out of control and crashed into a barrier. A video shared by his team captured the dramatic moment, showing the car, a Porsche 992, spinning seven times before coming to a stop.\n\nClad in his racing gear, Ajith was immediately assisted by stewards and taken to an ambulance for a precautionary check-up. His manager Suresh Chandra later assured fans that the actor was “unhurt, hale and healthy”.\n\nDespite the alarming incident, Ajith remains undeterred in continuing to forge a racing career, alongside his film commitments.\n\nA host of film celebrities, including Kamal Haasan, R. Madhavan and Samantha Prabhu, took to social media to congratulate Ajith on his team’s podium finish.\n\nActor Madhavan, who was also present at the event, took to Instagram and shared a photo with Ajith along with the caption: “So so proud... what a man. The one and only Ajith Kumar.”\n\nSuperstar Rajinikanth also took to X to congratulate Ajith. He wrote: “Congratulations my dear #AjithKumar. You made it. God bless. Love you.”\n\nAjith’s foray into motorsport dates back to 2002 when he competed in the Formula Maruti Indian Championships, impressively securing fourth place. The following year, he showcased his racing prowess on the international stage by finishing 12th in the Formula BMW Asia Championship.\n\n“For me, it’s all the same,” he said in Dubai. “Acting and racing are very physically and emotionally demanding jobs – most jobs are. It’s just about how you compartmentalise and prioritise.\n\n“I hate multitasking, so I wouldn’t do that. I’m just gonna try and focus on one activity at a time.”\n\nLater, he told Gulf News: “Sports is the ultimate leveller, offering more losses than wins and teaching grace in handling both. It brings out true character, instilling discipline and resilience.\n\n“Whether it’s managing fame or failure, life is all about balance, and sports serves as a metaphor for navigating these ups and downs.”\n\nAjith Kumar celebrating in Dubai after his team finished third in the 24H Dubai 2025 endurance race.\n\nPhoto: @ajithkumar_offll/ Instagram\n\n“Acting and racing are very physically and emotionally demanding jobs – most jobs are.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAny sport that features horses and human beings arouses curiosity.\n\nPolo is no exception.\n\nOriginating in Iran some 2,000 years ago, polo, referred to as the “game of kings”, was initially played by Persian nobility as a training exercise for cavalry units, before it spread to other parts of the world as a sport.\n\nThe game, whose modern version originated in Manipur, India, is played by two opposing teams of four horse-mounted players with the objective of scoring using a long-handled wooden mallet. A small, hard ball is used, and a chukka (period of play) lasts about seven minutes. A game usually takes between one and two hours.\n\nOwning a horse to play the sport was a pre-requisite for most of the last century. Even now, most of the top players have their own horses. But some clubs, like the Singapore Polo Club (SPC), offer horses for anyone to play the sport for a fee.\n\nHowever, it is an expensive sport, and only the passionate, committed players excel in it.\n\n“All polo players have a touch of madness,” said Iqbal Jumabhoy, a real estate development and hospitality veteran, who is among about 20 Indians who regularly play the sport in Singapore. “Polo is addictive. Once you start to play, you eat, sleep and dream polo. It’s the adrenaline rush, the horses and the camaraderie that keep you going.”\n\nIqbal, who is in his 60s, took to polo like a duck takes to water as his father Ameerali, a prominent businessman who died in 2020 aged 94, was the first Indian to play polo in Singapore and served as president of the SPC from 1968 to 1978.\n\nHis brothers Rafiq and Asad played polo, and now his son Imran and nephews Ali and Ameer play the sport.\n\n“It is almost like if you were born into my family, you had to play polo,” said Iqbal, who was president of the SPC from 2008 to 2011 and again from 2012 to 2014. “But, once you start, there’s so many opportunities to make friends from all over the world as you play against other teams.”\n\nSPC’s polo captain Satinder Garcha, a boutique hotelier and luxury real estate developer, has played polo in almost all major polo-playing countries – India, Argentina, the United States and United Kingdom. The sport came naturally to him as his father, retired colonel Kuldeep Singh Garcha, was the captain of India’s national team for many years.\n\nBut for SPC’s other Indian members like Rajiv Menon, who is in the finance business, luck played a prominent part.\n\n“My company had an event at SPC 12 years ago, and the first prize, which I ended up winning, was a temporary membership and 10 polo lessons free,” said the 52-year-old. “After the 10 lessons, the instructor told me I had talent and should pursue polo. That was it. I never looked back.”\n\nTo become a good player, one needs to train and play consistently for at least two years, said SPC’s lead instructor and professional player Ravi Rathore, a former colonel in the Indian Army who has played in five World Cups.\n\n“Anyone can learn to mount a horse,” he added. “But to become a good polo player it takes good riding skills and understanding the finer points of the sport. You can never say you are a finished product. You are learning all the time.”\n\nFrom the outside, polo might appear as a simple sport, with many thinking that only horse-riding skills are essential. But it takes a heavy toll on the body, with falls and injuries quite common.\n\n“Polo is so physical that sometimes it is not easy for people to appreciate,” said banking lawyer Ranbir Singh, 52, who has been playing the sport for 16 years. “The joke in my family is ‘why do you need to be fit?; it’s the horse doing all the work’. It’s true that the horse is the real athlete, but the sport stretches your body to the limit.\n\n“It’s an intensive, quick-paced and team-oriented game. The sport requires a great level of talent, coordination and fitness. The players must be adept at riding their ponies quickly, hitting a little ball with a mallet while maintaining awareness of their surroundings.”\n\nIn Singapore, polo was first played in 1886 by a group of British army officers and civilians at the Singapore Sporting Club, the predecessor to today’s Singapore Turf Club, at Farrer Park. Later, the SPC was formed, and it set up playing facilities at Tyersall and Balestier around 1915.\n\nThe increasing popularity of the sport prompted the club to search for a new and suitably-sized ground (polo fields have an overall length of 274.32m and width of 146.31m – roughly the size of three football fields). It resulted in the selection of three acres of land (later to be supplemented by a further 24 acres) at the corner of Thomson Road and Mount Pleasant Road.\n\nThe SPC opened that land for play in 1941 and built a clubhouse there in 1955.\n\nToday, the clubhouse has been replaced by a new multi-million dollar complex comprising changing rooms, a long bar, billiards room, restaurant, tennis and squash courts and a swimming pool.\n\n“The playing and club facilities are absolutely fabulous,” said Iqbal. “But the problem is with the image – people generally associate polo with a bunch of wealthy guys in white pants drinking champagne and enjoying life. Now, that is not the truth.\n\n“Frankly, for the majority of us, it is a hard contact sport. It’s one where you are trying to match your skills and also of your horse with another team. Polo has been democratised hugely in the last 50 years. You don’t need to own a string of horses to play the sport. Clubs offer horses and coaching, and this has allowed a much wider group of people to come in.”\n\nSPC has the Atoms Polo Academy, which anyone from five to 70-years-old can join. Group lessons cost $80 a session, with overall costs depending on how often one plays. The club has a rider and polo player base exceeding 1,500 and promotes inclusivity through public programmes and outreach initiatives.\n\nAround 200 members – mainly Chinese, Indians, British and Americans – actively play polo at SPC, with the club largely contributing players to the Singapore national team, which clinched silver at the 2007 SEA Games and fourth place at the 2017 SEA Games.\n\n“SPC players play matches locally and against international teams at home and away,” said Satinder, a former Singapore captain and president of SPC from 2017 to 2020. “To become a better player, you have to build your handicap, like in golf.”\n\nRanbir, who has a busy work schedule, said he would not give up polo for any other sport.\n\n“Polo really grows on you,” said Ranbir, who has initiated his son Jansher, 18, and daughter Harnaaz, 16, into the sport. “I thoroughly enjoy it, especially being with the horses who are such noble, courageous and intelligent beings. The partnership with them is primeval; you can’t find this in any other sport.”\n\n(From left) polo players Ravi Rathore, Imran Jumabhoy, Rajiv Menon, Ali Jumabhoy, Iqbal and Ranbir Singh at the Singapore Polo Club field.\n\nPhoto: Karthikeyan P\n\nIqbal Jumabhoy (left) in action against Argentinian player Hugo Palacios;\n\nPhotos: Karthikeyan P, Singapore Polo Club\n\n“The joke in my family is ‘why do you need to be fit?; it’s the horse doing all the work’.

And the guests in attendance know the lyrics to one and all – regardless of language.\n\nI couldn’t stop asking Kenyan journalist Mahak Dagar questions as soon as we were paired as roommates during the Know India Programme excursion last November.\n\nIt was an initiative by India’s Ministry of External Affairs to connect Indian diaspora youth with their cultural and ancestral roots. The 79th edition that I was privileged to be a part of was specially curated for journalists from various countries.\n\nDuring the three-week trip, during which we visited Delhi, Agra, Mumbai and Bhubaneswar, I met 26 participants from 11 countries, including Fiji, New Zealand, Israel and Suriname.\n\nWhile fully aware that the Indian diaspora stretched far and wide, it was still an eye opener for me to learn that there are sizable and vibrant Indian communities in places such as Nairobi. In fact, in 2017, Indians were recognised by the Kenyan government as the nation’s 44th tribe.\n\nWhen Mahak told me that the Indian community numbered around 100,000 in Kenya, I had a litany of questions. “How did Indians end up in Kenya? And why Kenya?”\n\nIndians began migrating to the East African nation following the creation of the British East Africa Protectorate in 1895, she explained.\n\n“We moved there mainly for the jobs, but many Indians also went there and bought land and created several different types of industry… Most Kenyan-Indians reside in Nairobi or Mombasa,” she added.\n\nMahak, who is of Marwari (from Rajasthan) ancestry, shared that her paternal grandmother – who was of Indian descent – was born in Kenya while her grandfather hailed from Agra.\n\n“When my grandmother got married in India, she lived there for a while after my father and his siblings were born. In 1995, my grandparents and parents migrated to Kenya,” Mahak said.\n\nHer great-grandparents migrated to Kenya just after World War II and started a laundry business called Kushal Singh Laundry. The business stayed open until 2008.\n\n“The Indian community in Nairobi isn’t that big in terms of numbers, but we’re quite prominent when it comes to the business and healthcare industries. My dad runs a pharmaceutical sales business,” said Mahak.\n\nWhile Gujaratis and Sikhs may be the majority, there are also Tamils and Malayalis there.\n\n“Growing up in Nairobi did feel different at times. My schoolmates would touch my curly hair and say that I don’t look Kenyan – but they are very accepting,” she said with a laugh.\n\n“We speak Hindi at home and my parents always emphasise the importance of our culture. In my community, almost everyone is related to one another, and we often meet in gurdwaras, mandirs and weddings.”\n\nIndians in Kenya, according to Mahak, celebrate the main festivals such as Holi, Deepavali and Navratri.\n\n“We get permission from the government every year to burst firecrackers during Diwali. We also embrace African culture and take part in Kenyan events where they celebrate their war heroes and heritage. Everyone in Kenya, Indian or not, enjoys African music.”\n\nAnd then there’s the food.\n\n“Just like bhaji and samosa in our cuisine, they have similar food in African cuisine. I love mokimo – a Kenyan dish of mashed potatoes and green vegetables.”\n\nThe level of similarity with regard to food is the same in the Caribbean, explained Wiraisha Sudarshini, another young journalist who hails from Suriname – a country in northern South America that is sometimes considered part of the Caribbean and the West Indies.\n\nIndians there, or Indo-Surinamese, form the largest ethnic group with 27.4 per cent of the population – some 150,000 citizens. Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 as indentured labourers, mostly from the modern-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the surrounding regions.\n\n“Curry is often found in West Indian dishes, but our version isn’t as spicy,” said Wiraisha, 26.\n\n“Most of us speak Dutch and Sarnami, which is a dialect of Bhojpuri.\n\n“The western diasporic experience varies from different parts of the world, but if there’s an Indian wedding, it doesn’t matter where you’re at – everyone’s going to vibe to Bollywood music.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5fca2f249a9da761cf5f94263892d45e5553425342f72b67b75c80126660cede?w=825", "alt_text": "Mahak Dagar (far left) and the author (second from right) outside \nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi during the Know India Programme excursion last November."}]}

You’re going to a destination wedding in an ashram?” quipped my daughter.\n\nWhen you think of a destination wedding, you picture sandy beaches, lavish resorts and choreographed sangeets; of guests dressed in Manish Malhotra’s finest with drones capturing their every pirouette for Instagram.\n\nBut have you ever considered swapping a private beach wedding in Bali for an ashram wedding in Dharampur (a town in Gujarat)? Well, neither had I until a close friend’s son tied the knot there. “Gosh, are we running out of exotic locations?” I thought.\n\nThe dusty roads of Dharampur, lined with rickety shops bearing names of gods, soon led to a huge welcome centre that resembled a posh hill station. There, we were slapped with a purple band on the wrist to indicate which wedding group we were with.\n\n“Hang on. There were more than one?”\n\nTurns out, five couples tied the knot at the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission, each ceremony presided over by Jain Gurudev Rakeshbhai. Instead of champagne toasts, there were moments of silence. The DJs and dhols were swapped for the soothing devotional songs.\n\nWhile strolling through the tranquil grounds, surrounded by chirping birds and the occasional temple bell, I wondered: Is this the future of Indian weddings?\n\nMarriage Olympics\n\nDestination weddings are a big deal. They’re like the Olympics of one-upmanship, where families compete to out-spectacle each other. “Oh, your niece got married at Udaivilas? Ours is happening on a yacht in Greece!”\n\nThe guests endure sunburns, delayed flights and choreographer-induced muscle pulls, all for the promise of exotic backdrops.\n\nBut this wedding at Dharampur turned that concept on its head. No fireworks, no lavish buffet, no influencers posting #ShaadiGoals. Instead, there was simplicity, service and – hold your breath – introspection. The event radiated peace, like a shaadi that decided to go on a Vipassana retreat.\n\nMindfulness, not madness\n\nWhen I arrived, I had the choice of a chauvihar dinner (a practice in Jainism where one does not eat or drink after sunset until sunrise the next day) or hi-tea featuring different varieties of paunk (a Gujurati snack made from sorghum grains).\n\nOh, okay, maybe all the action will be at the mehndi and sangeet, I thought. Nope. Instead, all the action was at a medical camp. Yes, a medical camp.\n\nPicture this: Guests rolling up their sleeves to donate blood while others queued to volunteer at an ad hoc hospital. Some 70,000 villagers are at the camp seeking medical help. I walked around agape at the activity.\n\nI overheard an aunty say: “Beta, did you get your cholesterol checked? It’s free here!” Not your typical mehndi ceremony chatter, but, somehow, it fit.\n\nLater, we toured a veterinary hospital under construction. “What’s this for?” I asked one of the grooms, imagining wedding guests riding in on elephants. “It’s to serve injured animals in nearby villages,” he replied earnestly. The bride chimed in, “We wanted our wedding to reflect our values.”\n\nWell, that’s one way to make a pre-wedding photoshoot memorable – pose with a rescued cow!\n\nFor breakfast, there was no dosa station or hot gossip. Instead, just fresh milk and rotlas (flatbread made with pearl millet flour) with fresh butter, followed by a group activity of rolling agarbatties and frying banana wafers to support underprivileged women. Refreshing.\n\nSaffron and serenity\n\nAfter dusk the wedding began with rituals performed collectively for all five couples.\n\nNo dramatic bridal entries to Bollywood songs, no flower boys tossing petals in slow motion. Just a simple procession into an amphitheater decorated with marigolds.\n\nRakeshbhai presided over the ceremony, sharing insights about love, commitment and compassion. His words weren’t just spiritual, they were oddly practical. “Marriage,” he said, “is not about finding the right person but about being the right person.”\n\nThe couples took their saptapadi (the most important rite of a Hindu wedding ceremony) vows about being faithful, equal and respectful not only to each other but to their extended families.\n\nA sage sentiment, but let’s see how it holds up during family WhatsApp group debates.\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, the new moon shined behind a statue as though blessing the couples. No multi-tiered cakes or loud yam sengs! No dancing till 4am! Just warm hugs, photo-taking and promises to stay in touch.\n\nAshram weddings: A new trend with no hangover\n\nSo, is this the new normal for Indian weddings? Are we trading opulence for outreach, and party flavours for philanthropy? Possibly.\n\n“My wedding is not just a personal milestone. Why spend millions on one night when we can use that money to create impact?” one bride remarked.\n\nFair point, though I suspect some in her family would’ve traded the ashram experience for a Taj ballroom in a heartbeat.\n\nBut maybe that’s the beauty of it. Not every wedding needs to be a spectacle. This one reminded me of what matters: togetherness, purpose and a lot less noise.\n\nAs I packed my bags, I felt oddly light. This wedding had left no room for hangovers or sore feet. Instead, it offered connection and enough laughter to keep things lively.\n\nSo the next time someone says “destination wedding”, don’t automatically think of Tuscany or the Maldives. Think of an ashram, where love isn’t just celebrated, it’s reflected in service, serenity and a cholesterol check.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/53afa7efdc337e9ec10013b26bfe4dba06ad697bd2a730c0e68160dda4b26bfa?w=825", "alt_text": "The simple wedding ceremony with guests seated on the floor."}]}

In contrast, about 1.8 million pilgrims attended the Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia last year.\n\nMore than 150,000 tents have been set up across 4,000 hectares, or the size of 7,500 football fields, to accommodate visitors, and nearly as many toilets.\n\nAbout 50,000 security officers are also on guard to ensure the event, touted to be the world’s largest gathering of humanity, goes off smoothly.\n\nIn the past, the gathering has been visible from space, with India’s space agency releasing photographs of it in 2019.\n\nThe budget for this year’s festival is an estimated US$800 million and analysts estimate it will boost economic growth by US$35 billion.\n\nReuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/edf28bb2bcc7d8efc0772027dca91eebc91f4048540b1cfb68547a9616321032?w=825", "alt_text": "Sadhvis, or Hindu holy women, taking part in a mass bathing ritual in Sangam, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers to mark the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj on Jan 14."}]}

Derived from plant-based sources like flowers, herbs, spices and woods, attar is distilled in a laborious process that yields rich, alcohol-free oils.\n\nTraditionally used in Muslim practices, celebrations and daily grooming, attar is more than just a fragrance – it carries stories of culture and family heritage. Though modern perfumes have flooded the market, the allure of attar remains strong, especially in Singapore, where a few family-run businesses continue to thrive.\n\nFor many years, GN Juzzi in Syed Alwi Road has been a beloved part of the Indian Muslim community for their unique and exotic attar and oils.\n\nThe shop was founded in 1995 by Mr Shaik Abdul Kader Mohamed Ghazzali, a textile entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu who migrated here in 1981. His wife Noor Aysha had a relative who was a perfume seller and the couple learnt the trade through her.\n\nThe business, which gained a strong following over the years, is now run by their children – Juwairiya, Zubair, Zaydh, Imraan and Inamul.\n\n“I’ll never forget my childhood memories of going to mosques and helping my father sell attar. This trade runs in our blood,” said Zubair, 30.\n\nApart from selling attar, GN Juzzi also carries popular Middle Eastern perfumes such as Rasasi and Lattafa. Customers can also opt for customised scents based on their preferences.\n\n“I am very confident this trade will not die,” said Mr Ghazzali. “In an era where many family businesses vanish because the children were not willing to take it up, I am blessed to say I have planted the business mindset in mine.”\n\nRoyal Fragrances in Bussorah Street is known for its oudh oils, which is extracted from the heartwood of the aquilaria tree, and has an earthy, intense scent. They sell various blends of oudh, attar and customised scent blends.\n\nThe shop was started in 2007 by Mr Sheikh Abdulla, 54, who learnt about perfumes and the trade from his uncle.\n\n“There are customers who ask us to blend fragrances on the spot,” Mr Sheikh said. “Once, an American tourist asked me if I could blend chocolate and orange fragrances. We had never blended the two fragrances before and so it was a new creation. We have customers who give us ideas too.”\n\nRunning the shop with his son Arshad, 29, Mr Sheikh said businesses like attar shops should be preserved so future generations will value the importance of heritage.\n\n“I always wanted to become a pilot, but I got attracted to this perfume business mainly because of oudh,” said Mr Arshad. “I was fascinated by its scent and researched more about it. After a while, I found myself helping out with the business.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/da94242059bfb1050180336e4fb3d13841d1a238678d5415bb0286518f0041ff?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

They will remain in Little India from Jan 9 to 17 as part of the harvest festival Pongal.\n\nThe earthy smell of cowdung mingled with the fresh scent of grass at Viknesh Dairy Farm in Lim Chu Kang Road on Thursday morning, as the premises buzzed with early morning activity while workers prepared for the transportation of sacred cattle to Little India.\n\nAs they were led to waiting trucks vibrating from the whirring engines, the cattle showed remarkable obedience. They climbed up the loading platform with practiced ease, offering only soft grunts as their hooves touched the metal surface.\n\n“All of them have been trained to step into the truck since the age of maybe a few months,” said farm owner Govindasamy Subramaniam, 74.\n\nFarm hands readied five animals – one bull, two cows and two calves – for their journey. Three vehicles had been arranged for the transportation: two for the animals and one for additional supplies.\n\nThe destination: Hastings Road in Little India, where the cattle will take centrestage amid Pongal celebrations.\n\nThey will remain in Little India, behind barricades, from Jan 10 to 17 for public viewing.\n\nPongal, a Hindu harvest festival celebrated by Tamils, spans four days and serves as a thanksgiving to the sun god for providing a bountiful harvest.\n\nThe second day of the festival, known as Mattu Pongal, is meant for the celebration of cattle, and it is when cows are honoured and worshipped. These animals are integral to the farming community, providing milk, helping in agricultural activities and holding deep cultural significance.\n\nAs the trucks arrived in Hastings Road, a crowd of onlookers gathered to witness the sacred animals’ arrival.\n\nThe cattle demonstrated remarkable composure as they descended from the vehicles one by one, their hooves making gentle contact with the ground. Without any fuss, they sauntered to their designated enclosure behind the barricades.\n\n“There will be barricades placed so that people do not touch the cattle,” said Mr Subramaniam, who added that the cows will be supervised by a staff member of the farm throughout their stay in Little India.\n\n“It’s a blessing to bring them here and be a part of the Pongal celebrations,” he said. “Especially in a country that’s modernised, industrialised and where a lot of farms are extinct.\n\n“It’s a great service for the Hindu community, and also for the other religions to get to know about Hindu customs, and why they give a lot of importance to cattle.”\n\nWhile direct interaction is restricted, visitors can still participate in various cultural activities organised by the Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association at various locations, including traditional games and demonstrations of Pongal preparation.\n\nMr Subramaniam’s son Viknesh, 26, who has been handling cattle since he was eight years old, shared insights about their farm operations.\n\n“I started handling cattle at a very young age for Pongal and even for Deepavali. This tradition has been ongoing for almost two decades, with the farm bringing cattle to Little India, even before the Indian Heritage Centre was built,” he said.\n\n“We are the only cow farm in Singapore rooted in religious purposes – and giving our products for religious reasons.\n\n“We live with the cows every day, we see them every day.

To me, it should not matter whether Australia won when it comes to the presentation. They played the better cricket so they won. That’s fine. I would have been happy to present the trophy with my good friend Allan Border.”\n\nGavaskar said he had been informed days earlier that the trophy presentation would depend on which team won the series.\n\n“I was told before the Test started that was going to be the situation. If India didn’t win or draw the series, I wouldn’t be required,” Gavaskar told ABC Sports.\n\n“I’m not feeling sad, I’m just a little perplexed. It’s the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, both of us should have been there.”\n\nCricket fans and pundits lashed out at CA’s move, describing it as “disrespectful” that Gavaskar was snubbed. It also created a sad situation for Border, with some fans unfairly laying the blame at his feet.\n\nThe controversy overshadowed what should have been a celebration of Border’s bravery amid the 69-year-old’s public battle with Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nCA’s strange call perplexed many Australians too, including veteran cricket commentator Neil Mitchell, who described the move as an “embarrassing error”.\n\n“Sunil Gavaskar seems a lovely man,” Mitchell wrote on X. “Humble, for a cricketing genius. How on earth could Cricket Australia not have him present the trophy with AB? It is an appalling and embarrassing error.”\n\nAnother X user @amenners said: “Absolutely farcical that Gavaskar wasn’t asked to present the trophy with AB. Disrespectful to one of the games true greats.”\n\nIndian fan @jkashyap wrote: “Not having Sunny on the dias is an insult. The series is named after him and Allan Border. Poor show by Aussie cricket board. They were too focused on highlighting the fact that they have won the series after 10 years.”\n\nIndian cricket board vice-president Rajeev Shukla expressed shock at CA’s arbitrary decision, especially when both the legends were present at the venue.\n\n“I fully agree with Neil. It happened when Gavaskar was present in the stadium. Trophy is in their names and one of them was not invited to podium. After four years, who knows whether both will be present at the stadium? Both together would have been a rare visual,” Mr Shukla wrote on X.\n\nSunil Gavaskar.\n\nPhoto:  AFP\n\n“To me, it should not matter whether Australia won when it comes to the presentation...

But, the Asian Yoga Sports Championship in Singapore has shed light on a lesser-known facet of the practice: its competitive dimension.\n\nThe 10th Asian Yoga Sports Championship, organised by the Yoga Sports Association Singapore under the auspices of Asian Yoga Federation of India, took place from Jan 6 to 8 at PGP Hall in Serangoon Road. The event showcased yoga as a discipline where participants were judged by professional referees on precision, alignment and grace in executing asanas (yoga poses).\n\nThe championship brought together around 150 participants from five Asian countries – Singapore, India, Vietnam, Malaysia and Hong Kong.\n\n“Yoga is not just about sitting still and meditating. That is a misconception,” said Dr Kumareswaran Superamaniam, president of Yoga Sports Association Singapore. “While that is one aspect of it, yoga is also about performing asanas with perfection. It is all about how well you can connect with your body and the universe, and yoga competitions give people the chance to showcase that connection in a structured setting.”\n\nParticipants competed across six categories: Yogasana Sports, Artistic Solo, Artistic Pair, Rhythmic Yoga, Professional Yoga and Free Flow Yoga. Some categories were further classified into eight age groups – from eight year-olds to adults over 35.\n\nIndia took home the championship trophy and they were followed in the standings by Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia.\n\nFor many competitors, yoga sports went beyond just the physical poses. Vanika Sharma, 18, for instance, said she loved the inclusion of artistic elements like rhythm and dance to make yoga more engaging.\n\n“Competing on stage with the pressure of representing Singapore was slightly nerve-wracking but incredibly rewarding,” said Vanika, who began practicing yoga thanks to her mother, an Ayurvedic doctor.\n\nYoga teacher Kalaivani Krishnan, 37, said the competition has significantly boosted her confidence. “The way we perform here is very different compared to how we normally do yoga, but the competitive environment challenges me and helps me grow,” she said.\n\nThe event had its fair share of challenges, most notably in terms of funding. Dr Kumareswaran said support for yoga sports came largely from friends and personal networks, rather than official sponsorships.\n\n“Hosting such an event in Singapore is expensive, and we’re not receiving enough support from the government or relevant institutions,” he said.\n\nHe underscored the importance of activities like yoga competitions in keeping youth engaged and active, rather than absorbed in gadgets, and expressed hope for increased local involvement.\n\nHe also voiced aspirations for yoga’s inclusion in the South-east Asian Games and eventually the Olympics.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a511b2f5122f1fb7044140137f3b3f42d634d9ec825d5cf240936168781134cc?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

We were all just students united by a common purpose.\n\n“I never feel that I am too old to learn or further my education. Spending on education and gaining knowledge is better than buying gold jewellery and keeping them in the bank.”\n\nDr Prema attributes her passion for lifelong learning to the words of her parents: “Even silver and gold jewellery may tarnish over time, but knowledge never does. It only adds value to the person who gains it.”\n\nHer thirst for knowledge helped her to rise up to the post of bank manager at the Banque Nationale de Paris, where she started working after marriage in 1978. Back then, she juggled her work at the bank with teaching in the evenings. She taught subjects in business management and commerce to  A-level and O-level students.\n\nHer doctoral pursuit was only successful on the third attempt.\n\nThe first time, her course with University of South Australia via Kaplan was discontinued halfway.\n\nLater, she enrolled in the University of Canberra’s doctoral programme with PSB Academy, but had to exit the programme after she broke her right hand in a fall. During that time, she also had to deal with the loss of her husband in 2015 due to an illness.\n\nIn Oct 2018, she re-embarked on her doctoral journey with Edinburgh Napier University on a part-time programme. Her plans were derailed for a period of time when Covid-19 struck, but she nevertheless pressed on to the end.\n\nInfluenced by her own entrepreneurship ventures, she chose to do her doctoral thesis on the topic of women entrepreneurship. “I was always interested in business and did try my hand at business (on a part-time basis) with the likes of Amway and Tupperware. However, I needed a regular income to support my family and couldn’t do business full time,” Dr Prema explained.\n\nNow that she has attained a doctorate, Dr Prema plans to go into lecturing.\n\n“I hope to go into lecturing at a polytechnic or ITE or to work with the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s SME Centre, so that I can boost the entrepreneurship journeys of women.”\n\nHer educational journey is not over yet, she said.\n\n“Using my SkillsFuture Credit, I recently attended a short course on coaching.

Kavi\n\nDAYAMAYEE BASKARAN\n\nGetting bitten by pythons while on the job is probably the average man’s nightmare. But for co-chief executive of Acres (Animal Concerns Research and Education Society) Kalaivanan Balakrishnan, it’s all in a day’s work.\n\nOver the past 13 years, the 38-year-old has caught more than 1,000 snakes – from boa constrictors to spitting cobras. It is a job that requires alertness, experience and a deep knowledge of animals.\n\nRecently, when a reticulated python was perched on an air conditioner compressor outside an HDB flat in Jurong, Mr Kalai had to ascertain how the reptile was positioned before he climbed up to retrieve it.\n\n“I looked down and up to see how it was positioned,” he explained. “If a python is coiled in a certain way, it could mean it’s about to strike.”\n\nMr Kalai’s knowledge and confidence in handling pythons grew over time. He caught his first python by himself after just two months on the job. By 2012, due to staffing shortages at Acres, he found himself frequently carrying out snake rescue operations on his own.\n\n“I was just catching left and right without any equipment,” he said. “Once you know their power and how they move, you won’t have concerns. Most pythons are not aggressive; they are just defending themselves when they feel threatened. But, of course, you can never be too cautious when handling snakes.”\n\nOne type of snake that has given him sleepless nights in the past is the spitting cobra – a venomous snake that spits venom when threatened.\n\n“They spit into your eyes to blind you so they can evade you,” Mr Kalai explained. “While the venom doesn’t penetrate the skin, it can cause significant irritation if it gets into the eyes.”\n\nHe has been spat on by a cobra on more than one occasion. Thankfully, he knew not to rub his eyes, and gently wash the “spit” off with water.\n\n“When you rub your eyes after being spat on, you risk rupturing small blood vessels and you allow the venom to enter the bloodstream,” he said.\n\nDespite the ban on owning pet snakes in Singapore, illegal imports of species such as ball pythons, Burmese pythons, king snakes and milk snakes still persist. Mr Kalai warns against this practice, emphasising that it ultimately causes more harm to the animals than good.\n\nWhen asked which animal he feared the most, his answer would surprise many.\n\nNever mind the 4m-long pythons or the large monitor lizards and their sharp claws; Mr Kalai’s biggest foe is the humble, furry squirrel.\n\n“The squirrel bite is a different level of pain,” he said, adding that the cute appearance and demeanour of the rodent is “deceiving”. “Gun to my head, I would put my hand in to get bitten by a python rather than a squirrel.”\n\nThough he has always loved animals, Mr Kalai’s journey into wildlife rescue was not something he planned for growing up. He studied industrial design at Lasalle College of the Arts and began his career as a designer. But after a while, due to a lack of opportunities within the industry, he decided to pursue his passion for animals. In 2010, he contacted Acres founder Louis Ng and joined the organisation as a rescue officer.\n\n“I always wanted to help animals, even though my parents thought it would be a lowly job. I earned just $900 a month when I started out – but I embraced the challenge,” he said.\n\nAside from snakes, Mr Kalai has also rescued crocodiles, dolphins, civets and bats.\n\nHe once rescued a 1.5m-long crocodile in Jurong, and said “there is no margin for error when rescuing such a reptile”.\n\n“It was an adrenaline-pumping experience that required teamwork and precise handling techniques,” he said.\n\nIn 2018, he found himself involved in a rare encounter with a dolphin. The mammal had been entangled in fishing nets, and Mr Kalai and his team of volunteers were under pressure to free it in time.\n\n“I had never seen a dolphin before, and it was entangled in some 8kg of fishing nets. By the time we got there, we feared the dolphin wouldn’t survive. But we acted quickly, and the dolphin was freed after an hour.”\n\nMs Anbarasi Boopal, co-chief executive of Acres, recalls that incident and Mr Kalai’s steadfastness.\n\n“Kalaivanan has no bias towards any animals or any rescue operation – an injured python is treated with the same compassion as a wounded pigeon,” said Ms Anbarasi, who has been with Acres since 2006 and trained Mr Kalai during his early days with the organisation.\n\n“When rescuing the dolphin, Kalaivanan made the quick and correct decision to release it back into the ocean instead of bringing it into captivity to treat the lesions on its body caused by the fishing nets.”\n\nMr Kalai said: “Sea mammals are known to survive such things because the salt water prevents infection. It was a decision made with the animal’s best interests in mind.”\n\nAt Acres, Mr Kalai remains committed to educating the public about co-existing with wildlife, and advocating for compassionate treatment of all animals, regardless of whether they slither or soar.\n\nTo that end, Acres conducts campaigns and workshops for all age groups, from pre-schoolers to corporate adults, offering programmes on topics such as animal sentience, leading an animal-friendly lifestyle, tackling the illegal wildlife trade and coexisting with Singapore’s wildlife. Educational guided tours, where visitors learn about rescued wildlife, are also available.\n\nVolunteering opportunities at Acres include the Sanctuary Volunteer Programme, open to those aged 18 and above. It involves daily animal care tasks such as feeding and cleaning. For volunteers 21 and older, the Wildlife Rescue Programme provides hands-on training for rescue missions involving injured or distressed animals.\n\nTackling a buffy fish owl fledgling.\n\nPhoto: Acres\n\nA sambar deer fawn he rescued from a canal in Bukit Timah.\n\nPhoto: Acres\n\nMr Kalaivanan Balakrishnan (left) rescuing a 3m python from a construction site\n\nPhoto: Acres\n\n“Most pythons are not aggressive; they are just defending themselves when they feel threatened.

Kavi\n\nAli Kasim\n\nI remember the trauma like it was yesterday. It was sometime in the late 1980s when my folks yanked me along for a chapati dinner at Norris Road in Little India. Only, it wasn’t just the usual chapati with keema we were having – but beja, or to the uninitiated, goat’s brain masala.\n\nAt the raucous coffeeshop that housed only the famed Azmi Restaurant – or stall more like – my dad coaxed eight-year-old me endlessly into giving the beja a try. I simply sat and stared at the dish in perplexity. Brains? How can anyone eat brains? I thought. But I gave it a go, and tasted mush coated in masala. I spat it out and washed my taste buds with a bottle of 7-Up.\n\nToday, some 30 plus years on, Azmi’s establishment still stands as the sole occupier of a corner coffeeshop in Norris Road. But beja is no longer on the menu, much to my chagrin.\n\nYou see, as I grew older, my taste buds became more sophisticated. And after having a delicious version of beja during my teenage years at a Gujarati relative’s home, I became a convert. It was then that I appreciated the texture of the uh... meat, and its unique taste which paired so well in between a tear of chapati.\n\n“Supply for beja at the market is hard to come by,” explained Mr Abuzer Alam, who runs the Azmi stall along with his brother Bilal.\n\n“Sometimes we can get, sometimes cannot. And then customers would complain: ‘Why don’t have? We travelled all the way here today’. So we stopped selling it completely.”\n\nAzmi Restaurant was started by Abuzer’s grandfather Ifthekar, who came here from Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. Together with his son Intezar Ahmad, he set up his now legendary Little India eatery in 1960, which soon became more familiarly known as “Norris Road chapati”.\n\nThe scene at the establishment today is a far cry from yesteryears’. Back in the day, Mr Intezar – or “bhaiyaji” as he was often referred to – would be ever-present behind a large tawa (round griddle), sporting a permanently stained towel over one shoulder and a scowl on his face as he patted down hot and puffed up chapati.\n\nThe place was always packed on Sundays, and the menu was limited to just three or four dishes, most notably the mutton keema.\n\nMr Abuzer, 45, said he remembers those days well too. His father died in 2006 at the age of 65, prompting him and his brother to take over the stall.\n\n“When my father started the business, there were just five or six restaurants in Little India – Komalas, Anandha, Sri Vijaya and one or two others. But only we served chapati. Now, there are around 130 eateries in the area,” he said.\n\nTo compete, Mr Abuzer has had to up the ante in terms of the menu offerings. Just last year, the stall started selling butter chicken and paneer with peas. There’s also fish curry and biryani on offer.\n\nSaddened by the lack of brains on a plate, I opt for a traditional order of two chapatis with keema and paya (bone marrow) masala.\n\nMutton keema is the prized offering at Azmi’s. Minced mutton seasoned with garam masala and other spices accompanied by green peas and finely-diced potato. Not every keema dish has potatoes in it, mind you, and this is really what makes Azmi’s version stand out.\n\nFor me though, it was the paya masala that I couldn’t stop dipping the piping hot chapati into. While it resembles “sup tulang” served at Indian Muslim prata joints islandwide, paya – a quintessentially North Indian dish – is thicker, spicier, and not at all red.\n\nMore significantly, it’s not just about the marrow inside the bone – which you have to repeatedly knock out, splattering masala all over the table and iPhone – but more so the trotter-resembling meat on the outside.\n\n“Simply delicious, and just like old days,” I said to Mr Abuzer.\n\n“Now please don’t discontinue the paya as well.”\n\nAzmi Restaurant.\n\nPhoto: T.

With aspirations of getting married this year, his future seemed bright.\n\nTragically, Mr Arulraj died after he was struck in the chest by the hose of a concrete pump truck at the worksite of a Housing Board Build-To-Order (BTO) project in Tengah. The incident happened at about 8.40pm on Jan 2.\n\nMr Arulraj was carrying out casting work when one of the outriggers of the concrete pump truck, which deposits concrete used in construction, punctured the concrete ground it was sitting on.\n\nThis caused the machine to tilt, and the pump hose to strike the worker, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), which is investigating the incident.\n\nIn response to queries, HDB said the worker was taken to Gleneagles Hospital in Napier Road, where he died from his injuries.\n\nAfter a funeral on Jan 4, Mr Arulraj’s body was flown back to Tamil Nadu on Jan 6, and cremated the same day in his hometown of Mudikandanallur, in the Nagapattinam district.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, friends of Mr Arulraj shared heartfelt memories with tabla!, expressing their sorrow for his parents, who are both farmers. Mr Arulraj was the first in his family to venture abroad in search of a better life, they said.\n\nMr K Prabhakaran, 30, a childhood friend of Arulraj, is still grappling with the loss of his friend. “I’ve known Arul since we were five; both of us were from the same village. I’ve been working in Singapore for the past two years, but I saw Arul here only on Dec 29. It was a wonderful surprise to discover he was also here.\n\n“I invited him to join me for church that evening, and he told me about the house he bought for his parents and his plans to get married. Later, we went to Tekka because he wanted to buy pooja items for Thaipusam. We planned to meet again on Jan 5.\n\n“I never imagined that the next time I’d see him, he would be in a casket at a funeral. This is all very difficult to move on from.”\n\nMr S Thiliban, who works in the service sector and knew Mr Arulraj for several years, paid tribute to his friend, saying, “Arul was a remarkable individual who came up in life through sheer hard work.\n\n“As the only male child in the family, he took on the responsibility of caring for his parents. He always treated everyone with respect.”\n\nMr Arulraj was employed by Keong Hong Construction, a subsidiary of mainboard-listed Keong Hong Holdings.

That is when flash floods – small and localised floods that typically do not last for more than an hour – may occur.”\n\nThe rainy season, which lasts through January, is not expected to let up any time soon. The La Nina climate phenomenon, which brings wetter and cooler conditions to the region, is forecast to return some time between now and March 2025, causing rain to extend beyond the monsoon season.\n\nClimate change is also expected to bring heavier, more intense and frequent storms.

Santosh Kumar\n\nTwo plays on the 1947 India-Pakistan partition within two months doesn’t make it a theme for playwright Haresh Sharma.\n\nHis play Eclipse, which will be staged at the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival from Jan 15 to 18, depicts three generations of men in a family and their journeys and understanding of the momentous separation.\n\nIt follows on the heels of HuM Theatre’s Train to Pakistan, staged at the Esplanade Theatre Studio from Nov 20 to 24, which starkly portrayed the violent and tragic aftermath of the division of British India.\n\n“You know, there are many plays about LGBT that’s not necessarily a theme,” said Haresh, 59, a Cultural Medallion recipient. “It’s just part and parcel of life that people are looking back at history to see what’s important in society today.\n\n“I think the world is going through a kind of transformation, and it’s a good time to look at historical events – to look at what terrible things are happening in front of our eyes that we should not repeat, or we should not support.”\n\nEclipse, Haresh’s monologue about a young man journeying to his father’s birthplace in Hyderabad, Pakistan, was first staged as a 20-minute play in Edinburgh in 2007. It was developed into a full-length monologue at the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival in 2008, and is being restaged at the festival this time as a 70-minute monologue.\n\n“A Scottish theatre company commissioned me to do a play about separation,” said Haresh, who has written over 120 plays that have been staged in more than 20 cities. “The most obvious thing to do was write about the separation of Singapore and Malaysia. Instead, I decided to write about the India-Pakistan partition.\n\n“As a playwright, I’m so used to writing Singapore stories. So I thought this was an opportunity to look into another kind of narrative. I know that my family was affected by partition, so I thought it would be good to ask my dad a few questions, get some facts, add a lot of fiction, and get the script done.\n\n“It was also an opportunity to look at personal stories – how people are affected by events that are beyond their control and why they have to bear the brunt of the pain and suffering for decisions made by people in power.”\n\nHaving learnt from his father that his grandfather was not in India during the partition but working in a textile shop in Japan from the 1930s, Haresh came up with a play about three generations of men as they deal with the turbulence of migration.\n\n“I thought I would create this story where there is the son, the person in the present and the main storyteller; the father, who talks about his experience with partition; and the grandfather, who reminisces about his experience of leaving his homeland voluntarily to find work in Japan. The play is about the lives of these three men who were impacted by what happened during partition.”\n\nSingaporean actor Shrey Bhargava, noted for his performances across theatre, film and television, plays all three characters. The only support he gets on stage is from the songs rendered by Hindustani vocalist Sveta Kilpady.\n\nEclipse’s first iteration was played by Glaswegian actor Umar Ahmed – in a Scottish accent, which was probably jarring for audiences in 2008.\n\nFor 29-year-old Shrey, it is the first time carrying a play on his shoulders from start to finish. So the pressure is intense. “I’ve never done a solo show where the focus is all on me,” he said. “But as an artiste, you want to challenge yourself.\n\n“It has also been a process of discovery. A lot of times the director is not so much telling me what I have to do. I am talking to the audience, so I know from the start I have to bring them in, look at their reactions and respond accordingly.\n\n“That is not to say that I’m improvising on stage. It’s all in the script. But I have to know what the audience might think at certain points, respond to that and carry the story forward.”\n\nShrey will wear one costume throughout; there will be no change of props or set. The three characters, though, will be played with distinct voices, postures and ways of walking.\n\n“I have to make sure they look and sound different,” he said. “We worked a lot on the transitions. How do I change from one character to another? Is it a simple snap? Is it more of a fluid change? We found solutions to all that.”\n\nDirector A. Yagnya, whose plays have featured at Esplanade’s Kala Utsavam and other theatre festivals, said it was all about “how to get the words out”.\n\n“Because it’s so full frontal, I had to take out all the decorations (from the previous iteration),” she said. “At the same time, I had to keep the storytelling engaging and bring the audience into the story.\n\n“Many Singaporeans do not know much about the partition or the turmoil connected with it. So, the story is basically narrated from the viewpoint of the son, a Singaporean in his 30s. You quite literally go on the journey with him – how he learnt and understood what had happened and what he felt about the whole thing.”\n\n“I think the world is going through a kind of transformation, and it’s a good time to look at historical events – to look at what terrible things are happening in front of our eyes.”\n\nPlaywright Haresh Sharma", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2d28fcfe6f2f364e60cd98f38363313e8374b2d84e5a4d5246f9064365eac9aa?w=825", "alt_text": "Playwright Haresh Sharma (left) and actor Shrey Bhargava, who plays all three characters in Eclipse."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nOver four days last week, about 45,000 people from Singapore, India, the United Kingdom, North America and around the region participated in the Naam Ras Kirtan Darbar, the largest gathering of the Sikh community in South-east Asia.\n\nThe religious extravaganza at the Singapore Expo featured speeches, devotional music, exhibitions, product displays and health screenings.\n\nOrganisers said the event, from Dec 26 to 29, was chiefly aimed at enhancing understanding, eradicate misperceptions and strengthen relations between people of different faiths in Singapore’s multi-religious society.\n\nIt also served  to remind the Sikh community of the key principles of their religion – appreciation and respect for others, universalism and inclusiveness.\n\nHeld once every two years, Naam Ras Kirtan Darbar, which loosely translates to “Festival of Sikh Music”, also featured a langgar or community kitchen manned by temple volunteers who served some 10,000 free vegetarian meals a day to the visitors.\n\nMembers of the public also got a taste of Sikh culture and heritage – from a photo exhibition to turban tying stations.\n\nAround 150 representatives from various religious groups in Singapore also attended the event.\n\nOn Sunday, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam visited the festival, where he was honoured with a shawl and shield for being a strong supporter of the Sikh community.\n\nAccompanied by Senior Minister of State for Manpower and Defence  Zaqy Mohamad, he toured the venue, partook in the langgar, met Sikh leaders and addressed the community.\n\n“I must congratulate all of you and the organisers for having an even bigger and grander event this year,” he said. “You have placed the Singapore Sikh community on the global map through Naam Ras. Please continue the good work as it has now become an international event.”\r\rOne of the highlights of the four-day celebrations was a 3D exhibition dedicated to the life of Sri Guru Amar Das Ji, the third guru of Sikhism. The immersive experience allowed visitors to gain a deeper understanding of the guru’s teachings and contributions.\n\nAnother spiritual highlight was the presentation of the sacred relics of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the 10th guru of Sikhism.\n\nAs in previous editions, there was an interfaith component where non-Sikhs were taken on a guided tour, engaged in a dialogue and offered the opportunity to volunteer.\n\n“Nam Raas was a great example of an event by the community, for the community,” said Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) deputy chief executive Khairul Anwar. “Besides learning more about the Sikh faith and bumping into numerous friends, it was heartening to see how this was done entirely by volunteers, who ensured there was something for every interest and age group – scripture, arts, shopping, martial arts, childcare, interfaith. Truly honoured to be invited to witness this.”\n\nMore than 200 volunteers ensured that the programmes were conducted on time and visitors could move around freely around the booths. They also helped the elderly check their health and fitness – supported by the staff from various healthcare providers.\n\n“We partnered Diabetes Singapore to provide free health screenings, addressing a crucial need in the community,” said Brilynne Zhang, brand director of Buzud, a manufacturer of a holistic range of healthcare solutions. “It was both a joyful and meaningful experience for us.\n\n“Given that this community has a higher risk of high blood glucose, lipid or blood pressure, we were glad to play a role in early detection of these issues.

It also beat MTI’s forecast of around 3.5 per cent made in November.\n\nMTI did not give a new forecast for 2025 growth but said in November that it sees growth slowing to a range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent.

Santosh Kumar\n\nI jumped the queue, and got the best experience at Naam Ras, the Sikh interfaith religious event that happened at the Singapore Expo last weekend.\n\nI got an expert to tie a turban around my head.\n\nI have always been fascinated by the Sikh turban and how it is tied. What is the process? How long does it take?\n\nI knew it was not an easy task. But I quickly learnt that the preparation takes more time than the actual tying.\n\nFirst I chose yellow, my favourite colour. But everyone wanted that colour. So I settled for orange. The volunteer at the counter said okay and then cut out a five-metre strip of cloth. I was surprised by the length.\n\nAn expert took over and began pummelling and crumpling the starched piece of cloth and sprinkling water on it. He told me the move was to make it soft.\n\nA few minutes later another volunteer joined him and both stretched the cloth to almost tearing point.\n\nI was then asked to sit straight by Sukhwinder Singh, who had come all the way from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, as he went about tying the cloth around my head.\n\nI was rebuked for trying to take selfies. “If you move your head, I walk off,” he threatened.\n\nHe asked me to bite tight one end of the cloth and look straight as he finished his work in less than five minutes.\n\nHe folded the cloth several times (a process called making the pooni) into a single layer and then wrapped it concentrically around my head in four layers (larh).\n\nI learnt it is not a difficult process.\n\nBut you have to master the specifics – such as how many metres of cloth to use, how wide it should be, where to position each layer and how to tuck it in to finish in style. And when to let go of your bite and allow Sukhwinder to complete the job!\n\nThe key factor is tying the keski (base turban) properly, as this gives the foundation for the main turban (dastar). If the keski is loose or too tight, it will affect the positioning of the dastar.\n\nSikhs wear turbans as a sign of their faith and identity. The turban is worn to cover the hair and is seen as a symbol of respectability and honour. It is also a way to keep the hair clean and tidy, as hair is considered a gift from God.\n\nThe turban didn’t weigh heavy on my head. It kept me cool, and I looked cool.\n\nFor the rest of the three hours I was at the event, I walked around proudly in my paghri (a more angular version of the Sikh turban), drawing admiring looks and comments from friends and visitors.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/54bb0c343d4b5e7a5c337408bcd0b03eb2d4007d0a246d93cf6d6f1f509dd0df?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Diya can also be paid in murder cases in which the relatives of the victim waive their right to qisas (principal punishment for murder) and choose to receive blood money.\n\n“For the past seven years, we have been trying every possible legal way to seek pardon and bring Nimisha home alive,” he told News18. “Our child was just two years old when this happened. She has seen Priya’s photographs and speaks over video calls with her, but she needs the support and love of a mother.\n\n“We are hoping that we can connect to the family of Talal Abdo Mahdi and find a solution. We are ready to offer diya in return for the life of my wife.”\n\nMs Nimisha’s ordeal began in 2017 when she was arrested while attempting to leave Yemen.\n\nHer lawyer Subhash Chandran said the trained nurse, who worked in private hospitals in Yemen for a few years. was convicted for the murder of Mahdi in July 2017.\n\n“He was her sponsor, and during the time of the Yemen war, she was tortured by her sponsor,” said Mr Chandran. “She wanted to get her passport back and run away to save her life, so she tried to sedate him. Unfortunately, there was an overdose, and he died.”\n\nConvicted of murder in 2018, Ms Nimisha was sentenced to death by a trial court in Yemen’s capital Sana’a in 2020. The verdict was upheld by Yemen’s Supreme Judicial Council in November 2023. On Dec 30, 2024, Yemen’s President Rashad al-Alimi reportedly approved the execution order.\n\nFollowing this decision, Ms Nimisha’s family and human rights advocates have intensified their efforts to save her.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed it is providing all possible assistance. Its spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said: “We are aware of Nimisha Priya’s sentencing in Yemen. The family is exploring available options, and the government is extending full support.”\n\nAccording to Yemeni media, Priya’s execution could be carried out within a month.\n\nDespite the challenges, Mr Thomas, a daily wage labourer and autorickshaw driver, remains hopeful. “I believe our appeals to Mahdi’s family will lead to a resolution. I am optimistic about discussing diya. My wife is a compassionate and kind person. We are determined to find a way to save her,” he said.\n\nIn November 2023, a US$40,000 ($55,000) payment was made to get negotiations started on Ms Nimisha Priya’s behalf. Her family will likely have to pay close to US$400,000 more in order to waive the death penalty, according to The Indian Express.\n\nInternational groups have joined the family’s efforts. With support from the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council – a collective of non-resident Indian social workers – activist Prema Kumari has been stationed in Sana’a since early 2024 to negotiate the payment of blood money. However, the discussions have faced numerous setbacks, prolonging the family’s anguish.\n\nMr Chandran said if the family of Mahdi is ready to accept the “blood money” and “pardon” Ms Nimisha, “her life will be saved”.\n\nTomy Thomas.\n\nPhoto: x\n\n“We are hoping that we can connect to the family of Talal Abdo Mahdi and find a solution.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFormer Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, who died of health issues on Dec 27 aged 92, was arguably the first Indian leader to lay the foundation for close ties with Singapore.\n\nIn 1994, Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Singapore’s prime minister, first spoke about setting off a “mild India fever” in Singapore.\n\nIt was triggered by Dr Singh, as finance minister, unshackling India’s economy from the “licence Raj” (a pejorative for the system of strict government control and regulation of the Indian economy from the 1950s to the early 1990s) two years earlier.\n\nDr Singh, who was prime minister from 2004 to 2014, described ties with Singapore as “warm and friendly”, shortly after giving then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong a ceremonial welcome in New Delhi in 2005.\n\n“Singapore has consistently been bullish on India’s reform process ever since it started (in 1991) and we appreciate this endorsement,” he said. “With the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), Singapore can act as a window into India, an India which is just beginning to realise its immense growth potential.”\n\nCECA, which was signed in New Delhi on June 29, 2005, paved the way for a closer engagement between India and Singapore.\n\nThough in recent years a section in Singapore has seen it as having mainly facilitated Indians to take up jobs in Singapore, the agreement led to trade booming between the two countries.\n\nWhile major Singapore companies such as DBS Bank, Sembcorp, CapitaLand, Singapore Airlines, Singtel and Temasek have thrived in the Indian market, the agreement has helped India attract foreign direct investments from Singapore and open the doors for further business links with Asean countries.\n\n“The signing of CECA was very significant,” said Mr Girija Pande, who was then the chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry’s Singapore chapter and attended the ceremony at Hyderabad House in New Delhi. “Dr Manmohan Singh was clearly the architect. He wanted open trade relationships with every country and saw the CECA with Singapore as a test for future Indian Free Trade Agreements.”\n\nCECA was the first comprehensive economic agreement Singapore signed with a South Asian country.\n\n“Dr Manmohan Singh considered Singapore a close friend and centre of what the then-Indian prime minister Narasimha Rao coined India’s Look East Policy,” said Mr K.V. Rao, a former resident director, Asean region, of Tata Sons. “He had great respect for Singapore and its development model, and during his visits to the island in 2007 and 2011 emphasised the need for closer cooperation and strengthening of the bilateral relationship.”\n\nIn November 2011, Dr Singh made his first bilateral visit to Singapore as prime minister and said the city-state had contributed much to India’s progress. “Ours is a partnership that stands on the foundation of shared values of pluralism, secularism and democracy, and convergence of our perspectives on regional and international issues,” he said.\n\nDuring that visit, Dr Singh unveiled a “Friend of our Shore” marker and bust of India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru at the Asian Civilisations Museum – on a green stretch along the Singapore River.\n\nBefore that, Dr Singh had visited Singapore in 2007 for the ASEAN summit, where he also pushed for greater investment and technology flows from Singapore.\n\nMr Lee, who is now Senior Minister, said in a Facebook condolence post on Dec 28 that he had known Dr Singh since they were both finance ministers and had met him many times over the years, most recently in 2018, when Asean leaders visited New Delhi for Republic Day. “I will always remember his warmth and kindness, as well as the friendship he had for Singapore.”\n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong, in his letter to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Dec 28, said the relationship between Singapore and India grew significantly under Dr Singh’s stewardship.\n\n“It (CECA) was a milestone in our relations and laid the foundation for the strong economic partnership we enjoy today,” PM Wong said. “Under his leadership, India joined the East Asia Summit in 2005 and actively supported Asean’s efforts in building a stronger regional architecture.”\n\nAgrocorp International chairman and managing director Vijay Iyengar said it was Dr Singh’s vision and determination that helped India forge close ties with Singapore.\n\n“Dr Manmohan Singh, a noted economist, knew economic trends well and saw Singapore as a gateway to Asean,” said Mr Iyengar, who was part of a business delegation from Singapore which met Dr Singh in New Delhi in 2003 when he was the leader of the opposition.  “He was humble and cordial and looked forward to trade flourishing between India and Singapore.”\n\nMr Malminderjit Singh, chairman of the Sikh Advisory Board and a former journalist, also found Dr Singh “very approachable” when he met the then Indian prime minister as part of his media assignments in 2012 and 2013.\n\n“Mr Singh was soft-spoken, patient and kind, said Mr Malminderjit. “His intellect was clear in all of his responses and engagements. He had a clear mind and vision on policies, especially economic growth and development.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6eddbbfc61c5fdfcb4079afbbc472165eeffcc688eccc533fd2dd30e517815b3?w=825", "alt_text": "Dr Manmohan Singh meeting late Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore on Nov 20, 2011."}]}

The country was literally facing the precipice of economic collapse, a parlous state of affairs demonstrated by its foreign exchange reserves being sufficient to cover only a few weeks of essential imports.\n\nThe crisis had resulted from a balance-of-payments deficit, but its structural causes pointed to deeper systemic faults: the limits of the Permit Raj and other protectionist ills that were associated with India’s mixed economy.\n\nThe mixed economy  had undoubtedly served India well by protecting its economic autonomy in earlier times. But shielding India from the world, in the form of both investments and competition, would not serve a national purpose any more because all that it did was to protect a politically privileged class of Indian capitalists while leaving the vast masses vulnerable to economic under-performance and hence unemployment and reduced purchasing power.\n\nDr Singh introduced economic reforms that liberalised the economy and opened it to the world. That transformed both India and the world.\n\nIndians benefited from the global market that could provide them with better goods and services than their domestic economy, and the world benefited from the entry of an economic power that could follow in the early footsteps of China’s opening-up to the world. Together, “Chindia” could and did much to provide fresh ballast to the global economy, which faced stagnation in the advanced market democracies.\n\nDr Singh did not have an easy time. I remember my leftist friends in India denouncing him for having paved the way for a new takeover of India by a reinvented East India Company (which had facilitated the British military conquest of the country through its trade policies in the 18th century).\n\nI pleaded with them: Dr Singh, a distinguished economist, is well-versed in the ways of evil imperialists/capitalists to know how to block them. Give him a chance, I said. The East India Company will not be back, in British or American or any other form.\n\nIt is not back. That, to me, is Dr Singh’s key nationalist achievement. He opened up India to the world without selling off the family assets.\n\nToday, the new India that he set in motion is a substantial economy. It has achieved this new global role without having sacrificed its democratic character.\n\nIndia’s democratic fabric comes under strain occasionally, but the system survives. It is that survival which underlines India’s rise to global powerhood, one baby Manmohan Singh step at a time.\n\nDr Singh was less successful as India’s prime minister from 2004 to 2014, not least because the actual power in his ruling Congress party lay with someone else. He was but the economic poster boy who now had a political face as well.\n\nYet, even as prime minister in a government wracked by inefficiency and corruption, he remained above controversy. Morally incapable of corruption, cerebrally incapable of poor thinking or inefficiency, Dr Singh represented India at its best.\n\nThank you, Dr Manmohan Singh.\n\nMortals come and go. What remains is “Sat Sri Akal” (a clarion call given by the 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh that God and Truth are the same thing).", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7d9d2889b312ded880249baa52d6e0346e28a1fd12bb7505b931511e4e5e1b74?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paying homage to Dr Manmohan Singh at the cremation ceremony."}]}

But, except for the horror-comedy Stree 2, no other Hindi film touched the Rs500 crore mark.\n\nMalayalam superstar Mohanlal said the success of films like Pushpa 2 are important for the Indian film industry.\n\n“To make an entertainer and bring out a big success is not an easy thing. It requires a lot of patience and many other factors. It is a magic recipe and nobody knows the formula. Pushpa and films like that are turning the wheel of the Indian film industry,” the actor told news agency Press Trust of India.\n\nLike Pushpa 2, Nag Ashwin’s futuristic retelling of Mahabharata in Kalki, starring Telugu superstar Prabhas with prominent roles by Amitabh Bachchan and Deepika Padukone, struck a chord with audiences in the Hindi belt.\n\nThe film’s Hindi version, released in June, made more than Rs290 crore, according to trade website Sacnilk.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to 2023 when Bollywood registered four blockbusters – Pathaan and Jawan, which raked in more than Rs1,000 crore each at the worldwide box office, and Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2 and Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal.\n\n“I would not call it a bad year for Bollywood, but yes, if you compare to 2023, we had only four films crossing Rs400 crore at the box office,” trade analyst Taran Adarsh told PTI. “Box office can be unpredictable and there are phases. But there are lessons to be learnt, we need to make films that cater to pan-India audiences. Bollywood will, hopefully, bounce back in a big way next year.”\n\nAmit Sharma, managing director of Miraj Entertainment, said 2024 was “disastrous” for Hindi cinema.\n\n“The business was down by at least 30 per cent compared to 2023 where we had Pathaan, Gadar 2, Jawan, Animal, Dunki, Fukrey and Dream Girl 2,” he said. “When it comes to Bollywood in 2024, you can’t really speak about anything apart from Stree 2 and to an extent Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 and Singham and films like Laapata Ladies and Shaitaan. Commercially there is no comparison between 2024 and 2023.”\n\nHorror-comedy seemed to be the most successful genre in Bollywood, as not just Stree 2 but Kartik Aaryan’s Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 and Maddock Films’ Munjya also did decent business at the box office.\n\nBut the Hindi cinema’s big bet on action movies, starting the year with Siddharth Anand’s Fighter, failed to yield good results.\n\nFighter, starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika, couldn’t replicate the success of the 2023 Shah Rukh Khan starrer Pathaan, which was also directed by Anand.\n\nThe movie, made on a big budget, reportedly around Rs250 crore, and featuring high octane action sequences, underperformed at the box office, earning just Rs212 crore, according to Sacnilk.\n\nThe Ajay Devgn-starrer Singham Again, the latest entry from filmmaker Rohit Shetty’s cop universe, amassed Rs247 crore. It did decent business but fell short of being a blockbuster.\n\nOther major disappointments at the ticket window were Yodha starring Sidharth Malhotra, Akshay Kumar’s Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, Devgn’s Maidaan, Aaryan’s Chandu Champion and the Alia Bhatt-starrer Jigra.\n\nIt was a good year for medium-budget films such as Shaitaan, Munjya and Crew which did profitable business.\r\rAmid the lacklustre run of new films at the ticket window, exhibitors relied on several old Hindi classics to fill the theatres.\n\nShah Rukh’s Karan Arjun, Kal Ho Naa Ho, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Chak De! India returned to the big screen.\n\nAnurag Kashyap’s 2012 hit Gangs of Wasseypur, Salman Khan’s Maine Pyar Kiya, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein featuring Madhavan and Dia Mirza, as well as Rockstar, Jab We Met, Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani also made a comeback to theatres.\n\nAudiences particularly embraced the Imtiaz Ali-produced Laila Majnu, starring Avinash Tiwary and Triptii Dimri, and actor-producer Sohum Shah’s mythological thriller Tumbbad. The two films performed better at the box office as compared to their initial run.\n\nIn a recent interview with PTI, actor Manoj Bajpayee admitted that Hindi cinema is going through a lull phase.\n\n“It is definitely forcing filmmakers to think differently. I’m hopeful that it will go back to its natural self very soon. I don’t see it as a problem because creative people always find a way,” he said.\n\n“I would not call it a bad year for Bollywood, but yes, if you compare to 2023, we had only four films crossing Rs400 crore at the box office.

The first is ‘anyhow’. It was appropriate as all of us were coming together without any training background and just running anyhow. The word also has another meaning – ‘brilliant’ or ‘excellent’, just like what we exemplify.”\n\nAmong the 165 people at the Dec 28 event was 45-year-old Senthil Kumar, who several years ago, had been diagnosed with prediabetes – elevated blood sugar levels that could lead to diabetes.\n\nHe then turned to running, and today, is completely free of prediabetes.\n\nRunning became his passion and he even completed the New York Marathon this October and the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) last month.\n\nSenthil and his son ran the 21km team relay while his wife and daughter took part in Thaarumaaru’s inaugural 5km year-end fun walk.\n\nIn total, there were 95 relay runners and 70 walkers. Around 50 were new faces.\n\nSenthil’s wife Suguna Thanagasundram, 48, a senior lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic, said a significant part of her husband’s achievements was due to the bonding among the Thaarumaaru Runners.\n\n“They have a great support system, giving my husband a lot of exercise tips,” she said. “They also keep changing the routes to make it interesting. One day you could be at Bedok Reservoir, and the next time at Labrador Park.”\n\nOne of the runners, Subashini Nagarajan, a senior project engineer at Fortis Construction, said she lost 8kg in seven months through exercise.\n\n“Due to my sedentary lifestyle, my weight increased to the point where I even struggled to walk up the stairs. That was a wakeup call,” said the 44-year-old.\n\n“My colleague Guru Sangarathas encouraged me to join his Gym Buddies programme at Fortis. Through that, I started hitting the gym twice a week. As he is in charge of both the midweek run and strength training at Thaarumaaru, I dived into running too.”\n\nFrom facing difficulty running even 200 metres, her progress has been remarkable. She ran 10km at SCSM 2024.\n\nFor the Thaarumaaru run, she was accompanied by her Fortis colleagues Guru, Julius Caesar (Filipino), Liquan, (Chinese) and Syah (Malay).\n\nOther runners included 62-year-old twins Raman Karuppiah and Letchuman Karuppiah who ran side by side and parents pushing their kids in a pram.\n\nThe route took participants to the Marina Barrage, where they made a turn and returned to the starting point when they were received gold-coloured medals.\n\nThere were also other fitness challenges, such as the longest plank, most number of push-ups and most juggles of a football.\n\nSaran Prema, 46, planked for 4min and 23sec and finished top among the women. She said: “Since young I have been sporty. I do zumba, yoga and taekwondo.”\n\nSri Haran, 29, a navy regular planked for 5min and 7sec.\n\nAs Thaarumaaru Runners end their remarkable 2024 run on a high, they have set their sights on at least one overseas hike and a run at Ha Long Bay (Vietnam), Angkor Wat (Cambodia) or Goa (India) in 2025.\n\nWomen are also encouraged to try at least one full marathon, with the 2026 London marathon as their target.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/846861f65d2a958fac9f780719a2f372c32de210a4191a925bd3e026bd0a568b?w=825", "alt_text": "Thaarumaaru Runners out on their run on Dec 28."}]}

She was probably the clear number three behind Ju Wenjun and Hou Yifan (both from China). So, it’s great to see her playing so well. I think it’s fantastic,” Nakamura said on Youtube channel Take Take Take.\n\n“Of course, the Indians will be celebrating once again, like they have a lot recently.\n\n“I think that it’s really great to see. When you look at chess, I think the Indian model right now is very clearly the best.”\n\nIndia’s year in chess became even better on Dec 29 when Humpy won a historic second world title in rapid chess in New York.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who previously won the title in 2019 in Georgia, joined Ju as the only players to secure multiple championships in this format.\n\nLast month, India’s Gukesh Dommaraju beat China’s Ding Liren to win the classical format World Championship in Singapore. And, earlier last year, India’s men and women teams swept the Olympiad titles.\n\nNakamura said sponsorship has done wonders to the Indian chess players.\n\n“You have all these players who have serious support behind them,” he said. “You have Arjun (Erigaisi, Indian men’s No. 1), for example, whose sponsorship is public with Quantbox.

She said: “This is quite unexpected because the whole year I have been struggling, and I had very bad tournaments where I just ended up in last place.”\n\nThroughout her career, Humpy has demonstrated consistent excellence in Rapid championships, securing a bronze medal at the 2012 Moscow event and a silver medal last year in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.\n\nThe Indian No. 1 accumulated 8.5 points from 11 rounds to secure her victory.\n\nHumpy also shared how support from her family helped her continue playing the sport and excel.\n\n“I think it was possible because of the support from my family,” she said. “My husband and my parents…they support me a lot. My parents look after my daughter when I travel.\n\n“It’s not easy to become a world champion at 37. It’s quite difficult when you get older to keep that motivation and stay sharp when required. I’m glad that I made it.”\n\nIn the men’s category, Russia’s Volodar Murzin, aged 18, claimed the championship.\n\nMurzin’s victory places him as the second-youngest FIDE World Rapid Champion, following Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who won at age 17.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6226fabbd0d5fb98ecdad511428370f48afa634e4db5a72c2a858d002f8e9ebc?w=825", "alt_text": "Grandmaster Koneru Humpy was crowned the 2024 FIDE Women’s World Rapid champion in New York."}]}

I saw a long queue of Aussies outside a green and white building. The pub?\n\nOhhh, yes, it’s the morning of the Boxing Day Test match and it is tradition to have a tipple or two to clear the throat and get it ready to cheer your team at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG).\n\nWelcome to the joy of my Indian family vacation – the perfect blend of relaxation, adventure and... cricket.\n\nCricket-mad male family members are master criminals at cleverly planning itineraries around important Indian cricket fixtures, and this year it was Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test between Australia and India.\n\nThe obsession unveiled\n\nFor Indians, cricket is a religion, a unifying force that transcends boundaries. It’s the single reason your husband and son are willing to endure an eight-hour flight, jet lag and questionable airline food – to witness 11 men chase a leather ball for five days straight.\n\nA recent survey revealed that 44 per cent of Indians are inclined to travel abroad to watch live cricket matches.\n\nThe Thrill\n\nThe first day, as we waded through the crowd, it was a festive atmosphere all around. Families with kids in prams striding with a mission to accomplish.\n\nAround us a myriad of Indian languages were animatedly providing professional opinions on the match that hadn’t even started. Punjabi, Gujarati, Telegu were the ones that caught my ear!\n\nAnd, if the mood wasn’t Indian enough, a bunch of tents were set up inviting all to have turbans tied, henna applied and butter chicken toasties devoured.\n\nSuch fun seeing the Aussies with turbans on their heads and an English man with an Indian flag painted on his cheek! Truly the spirit of sport bringing humanity together!\n\nOnce seated among the 87,000 people in the stadium, what caught me by surprise was that first electrifying roar that went up when Sam Konstas audaciously scooped Jasprit Bumrah for a six!\n\nWow, that sound in the stadium made Dolby Surround Sound 5.1 seem like a baby’s lullaby.\n\nThe gasps, the ooohs, the aaahs, chants of Innddiiaa Innddiiaa from the Indian fan section clashed with the Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oye! Oye! Oye! cries from the Australians!\n\nThe Mexican wave took my breath away. The solidarity of every member of the audience throwing their arms and voices up in unison was stunning. This, despite the killjoys in the members’ enclosure, who snootily declined to carry the wave through their hoity-toity section.\n\nThe fans refused to be snubbed and picked up the action as though the members’ section was a Kolkata pothole to be jumped over without losing a beat!\n\nColourful language has always been part of sport – on field or off field! Usually directed at the umpires or at the indiscretions of errant players, Indians are the undisputed champions of the world when it comes to the precision with which it is delivered.\n\nWhile there was plenty of that on display, I discovered the Australian art of settling a dispute without coming to blows.\n\nFour unreserved seats were contended between two groups of claimants – all Aussies. It was hard for us to mediate because both parties had only one line of argument: “F…k you, these are our seats.”\n\nThe same line was repeated with increased volume between healthy chugs of beer until the whole exchange was reduced to “F… you!... F… you!” These two words were hurled at each other with the monotony and frequency of a long rally at the French Open tennis.\n\nIt took a third party mediation with a bellowing “F…k You Guys! We are here for the cricket!” to bring a close to the abuse bombardment. Peace was restored and a beer break called!\n\nYou might wonder why someone like me who is not particularly interested in cricket would sit through a five-day Test match? It’s akin to watching paint dry.\n\nWell, I learnt that the answer lies in the nuances – the strategic plays, the psychological battles, the game plan. It’s a slow-brewing drama that rose to a cliffhanger when Virat Kohli slammed into Konstas! Boo, Boo!\n\nHoliday or cricket pilgrimage?\n\nCombining holidays with cricket matches has become a trend among Indian families. The perfect excuse for fathers to justify their sports obsession under the guise of “family time”.\n\n“Darling, look, the Botanic Gardens, we must visit, but first, let’s catch the morning session at the MCG.”\n\nPicture this: an Indian family in Melbourne, the father decked out in Team India merchandise from head to toe, the mother trying to sneak in some shopping between innings, and the kids torn between the allure of cricket and the temptations of theme parks.\n\nThe patriarch wins – because attending the match is an educational experience. “See, children, this is where strategy meets skill. Now, pass me the binoculars; I need to analyse Kohli’s cover drive.”\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, as I find myself in Melbourne, surrounded by thousands of cricket enthusiasts, I take a moment to appreciate the lengths to which fans go for the love of the game.\n\nIt’s more than just a sport; it’s a cultural phenomenon that brings families together.\n\nIndia lost but that did not take anything away from the experience. I’m ready to take another five days of fans, opinions, appeals and cricket!\n\nOoops. I think I’ve gone cricket mad! Now I understand!", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1e68c3abcc316773d49a91e62c7ebe7d0176961005fa7c25118a0b7e2c4666a0?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Dec 26."}]}

That language is Punjabi and it is taught to around 500 students annually through classes conducted by the Singapore Sikh Education Foundation (SSEF).\n\nThe non-profit organisation oversees the SSEF Punjabi School, which teaches students from the primary level to A-levels, and the SSEF Kindergarten that caters to students aged three to six.\n\nIn her welcome address at SSEF’s 35th anniversary event last Saturday, chairperson Gurdial Kaur elaborated on the organisation’s pivot to embracing technology during the pandemic, when mainstream schools shifted to home-based learning.\n\nWithin two weeks of school closures, SSEF established an online Learning Management System (LMS) using an open source platform to ensure structured lesson delivery.\n\nTeachers had to rapidly embrace new digital platforms by self-taping video lessons that were compiled into Google Slides and systematically uploaded to the LMS. They used Google Meet to conduct face-to-face lessons.\n\nThey kept students engaged through interactive elements – gamified spelling, grammar quizzes and storytelling videos – with the aim of increasing students’ exposure to Punjabi narratives while making the learning process more fun and immersive.\n\n“While some students took time to adjust, many found the flexibility and accessibility of digital learning beneficial, allowing them to revisit lessons at their own pace,” said Madam Kaur.\n\nThe Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda) stepped in to aid the SSEF as well as various community groups such as the Sikh Welfare Council to fund the necessary devices and management of the LMS. This support ensured students had access to digital resources.\n\n“This experience reinforced the understanding that technology must not only be seen as a temporary solution but as an essential long-term tool to enhance education,” SSEF said in their 35th Anniversary publication.\n\nPunjabi language classes are currently held every Saturday at two weekend centres: Xinghua Primary School (SSEF Punjabi School) and the Singapore Khalsa Association (SSEF Kindergarten). SSEF is working with the Board for the Teaching and Testing of South Asian Languages to introduce a new LMS portal so that future classes can adopt a hybrid model of in-person sessions and e-learning.\n\nThe school’s curriculum has also evolved from relying solely on photocopied worksheets to developing a comprehensive syllabus that includes its own textbooks, detailed lesson plans and workbooks.\n\nIn his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, the event’s guest-of-honour, emphasised the importance of a bilingual education and its role in strengthening multiculturalism in Singapore.\n\nHe had also penned the foreword for SSEF’s 35th Anniversary publication, in which he commended the organisation’s dedication to providing high-quality and accessible Punjabi education in Singapore and its foresight in embracing digital transformation.\n\nSakti Singaravelu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/51cb9bd223d14a10d4a337252a6fc1b8d6e3c4b54a602557f8f43719cd926242?w=825", "alt_text": "Singapore Sikh Education Foundation chairperson Gurdial Kaur showing DPM Heng Swee Keat the organisation’s kindergarten syllabus."}]}

These stalls serve a rotating selection of Ren Min’s locally produced craft beers on tap.\n\nTalk to him about craft beer and you’ll find the Singaporean’s reply to be endless – from detailing the types of brew his stalls sell to expressing his disdain of the word “craft”.\n\n“I actually hate the word craft beer because it’s often used as a pure marketing point. So many beers are labeled as craft, but you drink it and it’s a poorly made beverage. It’s just an opportunity for a business to label their product, mark it up and sell it.\n\n“But the phenomenal thing about beer that we’ve realised in the past 30 or 40 years is that it can be a lot of things – not just your regular lager. It’s really up to the creativity of the brewer. You can do so many things around it. If some component of the drink is still beer, it can still be a unique beverage on its own.\n\n“I wanted to be part of the industry because I’ve noticed good quality beer taking off in other countries. And I felt the same thing would happen in Asia.”\n\nAs he takes a sip of the bubbly beverage, I ask Manbeer about his previous job as a lawyer. Raised by a single mother who was a teacher, Manbeer moved to Indonesia after primary school when his mum remarried. There, he attended the Jakarta International School – which explains his slightly Americanised accent. When he returned to Singapore, he attended law school at NUS.\n\n“I was in practice for about five years. I used to work for (prominent lawyer) Davinder Singh, and then I got burnt out,” he says with a smile, shaking his head.\n\n“I enjoyed it, but it also was very taxing – the high expectations, the long hours. At one point I took a break from it, and in the midst of that break, I decided to start this business.\n\n“I always had plans to (open an F&B outlet). By doing it now, I knew that if I failed, at least I’d be young enough to go back to practising law.”\n\nStarting up Ren Min wasn’t at all easy. When the Covid pandemic hit, plans to build and operate a brewery in Singapore to complement the stalls were scrapped. After losing money on that front, the circuit breaker period made things even worse.\n\nSomehow, Manbeer says, he and his start-up team survived. They pivoted to “gypsy brewing”, where they pay to use another company’s facilities to get their beer made.\n\nToday, both stalls are running smoothly, with Manbeer handling the business operations while a partner oversees the brewery operations. They have nine to 10 part-time bartenders across both outlets.\n\nSetting up the bars in hawker centres have also reaped benefits in terms of lower rent and overheads – as opposed to a stand-alone bar.\n\n“Our hawker centers are in a way akin to the beer halls in Germany. It’s where the community – of all economic statuses – come and mix together,” he explains, adding that he wanted to sell Ren Min beer at an affordable price. One of the bar’s popular offerings is the Jiayou Pale Lager, which costs $12 a pint. At a bar, craft beers cost $15 on average.\n\nGulping down his last sip of beer, Manbeer turns to me and says: “You know, you mentioned about my name earlier. Actually, in Punjabi, Manbeer means ‘brave mind’, but it could also mean ‘foolish’ as well.\n\n“When my parents heard I was leaving law and starting a beer business, they thought I was being very foolish. They tried to talk me out of it. Part of that relates to my grandfather, who was a businessman here back in the 80s.\n\n“When Covid hit, and things were a struggle, my mum explained that she didn’t want me to do this because of how much my grandfather struggled in trying to build something. And in the end, it all got taken away from him. She didn’t want the same to happen to me.\n\n“Thing is, I would have done it regardless. Once you have an itch, you have to scratch it, right? Plus, life is a journey and you have to take a risk sometimes.\n\n“So yes, beer aside, you could say I was being brave. But it could also mean I’m being very foolish.”\n\nPhoto: The Straits Times\n\n“Actually, in Punjabi, Manbeer means ‘brave mind’, but it could also mean ‘foolish’ as well. When my parents heard I was leaving law and starting a beer business, they thought I was being very foolish.”\n\nManbeer Singh, who owns and runs Ren Min, a hawker stall selling craft beer at Maxwell Food Centre", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a3fc1aebee183d9b1ce2e1da6ff4747c13c7c07e3d7854050883517dec267e64?w=825", "alt_text": "Ren Min founder Manbeer Singh at his hawker stall-cum-brewery at Maxwell Food Centre, 28 November 2024."}]}

It is also obstructing the rescuers’ path to the end point.\n\nMarine commandos of the Indian Navy were roped in on Wednesday to help.\n\n“Initially, the plan involved sending a JCB (digger) inside the tunnel to remove the mud. But how will the machine navigate inside in a 360-degree manner?” a senior Telengana government officer told the Deccan Herald. “There is already a significant amount of water surrounding the area, making it impossible for the machine to manoeuvre.\n\n“There is a risk of further collapse of the upper surface if the silt starts clearing, which may lead to a bigger disaster. On top of that, the heavy tunnel boring machine is filled with concrete debris and iron parts. It is unimaginable how the 10,000 cubic meters of mud can be brought out through trucks that can each carry only around five cubic metres at one time.\n\n“Without clearing the mud, reaching the last 40m where the men are suspected to be trapped is not possible.”\n\nThe Hindu reported that a 20-member team of experts managed to reach close to the end point of the tunnel on Wednesday but had to turn back as “there was a lot of debris”.\n\n“They are working out how to go about clearing the debris,” Nagarkurnool Superintendent of Police Vaibhav Gaikwad told news agency PTI.

The bride’s best friend was standing a metre from the bride, and before anyone could intervene, he placed the ceremonial garland over the woman.\n\nAs confusion rippled through the crowd, he removed the garland and placed it around the neck of a male friend beside her.\n\nThen, to perhaps maintain a certain symmetry, he garlanded an elderly guest as well.\n\nThe wedding guests remained quiet as the drama unfolded. They watched the action with curiosity.\n\nBut the bride did not stay silent. She slapped the groom and walked away.\n\nSoon, a fight erupted between the two families with both sides throwing chairs at each other.\n\nPolice were eventually called in and took charge of the situation, sending the groom away from the scene along with his wedding procession.\n\nIt had taken months of preparation for the wedding.\n\nThe bride’s brother Omkar Verma said the family had spent more than Rs10 lakh ($15,000) on the whole affair.\n\nHe had his own theory on why things went wrong.\n\n“They were unhappy with the dowry gifts. Maybe this was their way of humiliating us,” he told the Times of India.\n\n“And then we find out that he isn’t even a farmer, as his family told us. He’s actually a truck driver.”\n\nAccording to the police report made by the bride’s family, the groom’s family demanded additional dowry.\n\nThe bride’s father told NDTV that he had given Rs2.5 lakh during the pre-wedding rituals and another Rs2 lakh on the morning of the wedding. But those sums didn’t seem enough.\n\nAnother version of the story is that Mr Kumar wanted to marry another woman, and he misbehaved in an effort to get the wedding with Ms Devi cancelled.\n\nAt 4am the next day, Mr Kumar and some of his friends were arrested.\n\nBy noon, he apologised, and his family suggested the wedding should go on. But Ms Devi refused.\n\nPolice officer Harsh Modi, who is more used to break-ins and thefts, kept his summary brief: “The groom was intoxicated. He misbehaved. His medical examination confirmed he was drunk. He was booked under sections of the Dowry Act.”\n\nFriends allegedly supplied illicit liquor to the groom.

He confesses his love to a girl after he gets awarded the gold medal.\n\nHowever, she rejects him, stating that she sometimes prefers “bad boys”, who are unruly and roam around the school with gethu (swag).\n\nCut to his college days, Ragavan becomes Dragon because of the rejection. He earns the love of Keerthi (Anupama Parameswaran).\n\nBut, six years after their relationship, Keerthi realises that Ragavan is a failure. She breaks up with him, stating that she received a marriage proposal from a smart and successful guy who earns over Rs1 lakh a month.\n\nThis breakup transforms Ragavan’s life. Initially consumed by hatred for Keerthi, it also leads him down dangerous paths.\n\nBefore the release of Dragon, there was talk that it was a copy of Sivakarthikeyan’s Don 2. While both stories share similarities, they are quite different.\n\nIn college, principal Mayilvahanan (Mysskin) has a problem with Ragavan’s attitude. But he is not a tough principal who believes in punishment. He knows the importance of education in one’s life and gives his students a chance to rectify their mistakes.\n\nDirector Marimuthu’s storyline is an engaging one.

Never thought a mainstream Indian film will crack it.”\n\nAnother user agreed that the movie has the same level of gore as the Hollywood films, while some agreed Marco’s level of violence might be on the level of Korean films.\n\nHowever, Marco has seen unprecedented success, turning it into a super hit in Malayalam.\n\nOn top of that, the film has received immense love from the Hindi audience, making it Malayalam cinema’s highest-grossing Hindi-dubbed film.\n\nAccording to the Sacnilk website, the film has collected Rs37.35 crore from India in 11 days ,with Rs34.97 crore share from Malayalam and Rs2.38 crore from Hindi.\n\nThe film released in Telugu on Jan 1, and will release in Tamil today.\n\nThis immense and unexpected popularity of the film has led to Netflix acquiring the digital rights.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/96fd35dd3affedb0fb54402282535478f4b4ec066e312c919f846a084c41c645?w=825", "alt_text": "Unni Mukundan in a still from Marco."}]}

The only way to do so, according to her, was by fostering authentic friendships with them.\n\nOne of the friends she made through the creation of this series was K Rajendran, 61, who inspired her Thaipusam painting. Tsuyumi first saw him at last year’s Thaipusam procession, pierced with rods, carrying a kavadi. She was taken by the trance-like state he had slipped into, surrendering to Hindu deity Murugan. In that moment, she recognised something extraordinary about him that needed to be captured on canvas.\n\nNormally, Tsuyumi conducts interviews with her subjects to learn about their backgrounds, but the bustle of Thaipusam kept her from speaking to the devotees directly. Instead, she relied on observation to convey the raw energy of the moment.\n\n“Meeting Raj in person and getting to know him confirmed the initial feeling I had,” she said.\n\n“All the artisans I have painted are part of my destiny, and Raj is no exception. Our paths crossed in a way that felt inevitable.”\n\nDuring their time together, Tsuyumi said their connection evolved beyond that of artist and subject, growing into a bond rooted in a shared appreciation for tradition.\n\n“Singapore has been my home for 13 years, but I attended Thaipusam for the first time only last year. I was so deeply touched and appreciative that they allowed me in their space to capture a moment that I have now painted,” said Tsuyumi, who is married to a Briton.\n\nIt took Tsuyumi nearly ten months to complete the portrait of Rajendran, finishing in November last year. He saw the painting for the first time in January.\n\n“It was a pleasant surprise to see it. My family came with me to see it for the first time and it was a special moment for us. I am so thankful that she created a portrait of me,” said Rajendran, an operations manager at a secondary school.\n\nTsuyumi, as a show of appreciation and support, returned to this year’s Thaipusam procession to watch him carry a kavadi again.\n\nBefore moving here in 2012, Tsuyumi was a radio broadcaster in Tokyo. After her stint at the station came to an abrupt end due to funding issues, she decided to explore opportunities abroad, with Italy, New York and London on her shortlist. However, her childhood friend who was based in Singapore at the time convinced her to move here.\n\nTsuyumi said she fell in love with the country and never looked back. She learnt how to paint at a young age, but revisited the art form only after coming to Singapore.\n\n“At a young age, I became proficient at calligraphy and started painting,” she said. “As a teenager, I became involved in television and acted in various Japanese dramas, before entering Tama Art University to study Theatre and Art.\n\n“I rediscovered my love for painting in Singapore. In the past, I used many different mediums, but I am currently using acrylics which I find better suited to the tropical atmosphere. Colour and light are very important to me as my work is an expression of feeling.”\n\nIn addition to Rajendran, Tsuyumi also painted a portrait of Sevugan Ponnalagu, a female garland seller in Little India, with whom she developed a close friendship.\n\n“Ponna”, as Tsuyumi affectionately calls her, even invited Tsuyumi to her son’s wedding earlier this month. “I am so touched she liked me enough to invite me, I felt very emotional about it,” Tsuyumi said.\n\n“These paintings are not just images, they are stories of dedication, love and knowledge, passed from one generation to the next,” she said.\n\nFor her, the value of her paintings is inseparable from the memories she holds of the people that inspired them.\n\nThe Singapore Heritage Festival will be carrying Tsuyumi’s artwork at Gardens by the Bay in a digital format in May.\n\nReema Dudekula", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d4e8944d4bc71fd096b4303055397bf5eb0071ea80cc2ae0b380d3ec09d56f35?w=825", "alt_text": "Artist Tsuyumi Miwa with her muse K Rajendran."}]}

It was his 299th 50-over outing, and he now has 14,085 runs in only 287 innings.\n\nHis outstanding innings has once again ignited the debate over the greatest batter in one-day cricket.\n\nViv Richards dominated the 50-over format in the fledgling years when the game was essentially a condensed version of Test cricket.\n\nThe West Indian averaged 47 and his legendary 189 not out against England in 1984 stood as the highest ODI score for a dozen years.\n\nIt was his strike-rate of 90 that really stood out in an era where 70 was deemed decent on surfaces that offered balance between bat and ball.\n\nIndian legend Tendulkar dominated the subsequent two decades amid the rise in ODI popularity. Batting at the top of the order, he was indefatigable as he rewrote the record books. He played in the most ODIs (463), scored the most runs (18,426) and – until November 2023 – had the most centuries (49).\n\nThere are also the consistent Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara and South African AB de Villiers, with his power hitting, in the fray.\n\nHowever, now there’s a growing consensus among certain former players that Kohli could be the greatest ODI player, surpassing even Tendulkar.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Atherton feels that there’s nobody better than Kohli in ODI history when it comes to run-chases. Kohli has hit 28 centuries during run-chases in ODIs – the most in history. Tendulkar, with 17 hundreds, is second on this list followed by Rohit Sharma who has 16.\n\n“Virat Kohli in a run-chase in 50-over cricket, there’s been nobody better in the history of the game, really. 51 century is an unbelievable number,” said Atherton on Sky Sports Cricket Podcast.\n\n“I mean, he’s got 51 and he passed 14,000 runs, which only Tendulkar and Sangakkara have got past in one-day cricket. And he got them in 60-odd innings quicker than Sachin, and about 90-odd innings quicker than Kumar. He’s been a great all-format player, clearly, but you’d probably say that ODI is his absolute best format.”\n\nAnother former England captain Nasser Hussain reckoned that Tendulkar, Sangakkara and de Villiers will be part of the greatest ODI player debate, but Kohli surpasses them all.\n\n“You’d have to say he’s probably the best player of all time in ODIs with those stats,” said Hussain, England’s captain from 1999 to 2003. “You’d have Tendulkar in the same conversation. Kumar, AB de Villiers; they’ve been some great ones, but he’s right at the top of the tree.”\n\nFormer Australian captain Ricky Ponting too hailed Kohli after his unbeaten ton against Pakistan.\n\nSpeaking on the ICC Review, Ponting said he has not seen a better ODI player than Kohli. He noted that the India star would want to go on and become the leading run-scorer in ODI cricket.\n\nPonting said: “He’s obviously been a champion player for a long, long time. And particularly in the white-ball formats, where he’s been an unbelievably good 50-over player. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a better 50-over player than Virat Kohli.”\n\nPonting admired Tendulkar’s longevity, which has kept him 4,000 runs ahead of Kohli. However, he noted that Kohli can reach the milestone if he maintains his hunger for runs.\n\nIn India, Kohli, current captain Rohit Sharma and Tendulkar are often the subject of intense debates and comparisons.\n\nRecently, former Indian opener Virender Sehwag weighed in on this debate, revealing who he believes is the best ODI batsman among these three giants. In a panel discussion with Cricbuzz, Sehwag unveiled his top five ODI batters.\n\nAt No. 5, he placed the explosive West Indian Chris Gayle. South Africa’s versatile maestro de Villiers took the fourth spot, while Pakistan’s cricketing kingpin Inzamam-ul-Haq was third.\n\nSehwag then went on to praise his idol, Sachin Tendulkar, dubbing him a “lion” of the game, and ranked him as the second-best ODI batsman in the world.\n\nSehwag then named his Delhi compatriot Kohli as the No. 1 ODI batsman.\n\nInterestingly, despite Sharma’s remarkable feat of scoring three double centuries in ODIs, Sehwag didn’t include him in his top five list, and chose Kohli as the superior player over both Rohit and Tendulkar in the format.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/52ffe3ce08d2c6172f5f3aca550e76bf3a0648b9567936e3689d4f22ac7d916e?w=825", "alt_text": "India’s Virat Kohli."}]}

More recently, in the semi-finals, he scored 90 not out.\n\nAn Indian national who moved to Singapore when he was three months old, Karthik shares a dream with hundreds of millions – to some day play for the Indian cricket team.\n\nThough he’s not old enough to have ever watched the legendary Sachin Tendulkar play in real time, Karthik cites him as his idol, and has been trying to emulate Sachin’s style and technique whenever he plays.\n\n“My dad wanted to be a national-level cricketer; it was his dream, and I would like to fulfil it,” said Karthik, a right-handed batsman who picked up the sport at the age of five.\n\n“Cricket has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I watch highlight reels of Sachin daily, and every time India plays, I’ll stay up and watch them.\n\n“I have to work hard. I practice everyday; after school I go straight to training to keep up my form.”\n\nKarthik’s 202 not out against SCC Academy last July is testament not just to his passion but also his prowess. In that match, the one-down batsman faced 81 balls and hammered nine sixes and 30 fours.\n\nWhen asked about achieving the double century, however, Karthik simply emphasised “team”.\n\n“My only duty is to score a good number of runs for my team, so I try my best to achieve that on the pitch,” he said.\n\nHis school coach Kshitij Shinde, a former national player, said Karthik’s greatest strength is his discipline.\n\n“He is very committed to being the best he can be, no matter how tired he is,” Kshitij said. “I have no doubt Karthik has what it takes to climb the rungs of the professional cricket ladder.”\n\nFor his part, Karthik’s father, Prahlad Singh, said he’s willing to go the whole nine yards in helping his son achieve his dream.\n\n“His cricketing career has only just begun”,\n\nsaid the 41-year-old IT professional. “I know the chances of failure in this sport are high because of the competitiveness. I spend most of my weekends as well as weekdays after work with him during his training.\n\n“I can provide all the support he needs but it comes down to how passionate he is about the sport.”\n\nKarthik was recently selected for the national Under-14 squad after trials last month.\n\nImpressive as he has been in the junior circuit here, prodigies like Karthik, who trains under the SportyGo cricket academy and has a personal coach, are not uncommon in India, where millions of young boys – just as talented – hope for the opportunity to join major academies and to someday play the sport professionally.\n\nNevertheless, when told of Karthik’s 202-run achievement, former Singapore captain Chetan Suryavanshi described it as “phenomenal”.\n\n“One needs a lot of maturity to stay on a pitch for that long, and doing that at just 11 years old is really special,” said the 39-year-old.\n\nChetan, who once scored 197 in a Premier League 50-overs match at the Singapore Cricket Club\n\n,\n\nadded: “You need a calm and collective disposition to achieve it. Stamina is a gift at a young age, but mental acuity is a skill.\n\n“It is easy for one to become complacent after scoring just one century. To stay hungry for more is a sign of great maturity.”\n\nReema Dudekula\n\nKarthik Bisht at the age of 11 was recently selected for the Singapore Cricket Association’s Under-14 squad.\n\nPhoto: T.

There was no courtship – only a brief meeting to confirm the match, a practice common at the time. Mr Nadaison and Mrs Soranam were 29 and 22 respectively at the time.\n\nSpeaking to tabla! at the Golden Jubilee Wedding Celebrations, the couple recalled the early years of their marriage, which were marked by nervousness and uncertainty as they hardly knew each other.\n\n“We didn’t think about love before marriage. We just accepted what our parents believed was best for us,” said Mr Nadaison, now 81.\n\nA test of their relationship came in the 1980s when they faced financial difficulties. Recalling those tough times, Mr Nadaison said: “As a junior employee, I earned only about $200 a month. We had to manage all household expenses within that limited income.”\n\nMrs Soranam, a homemaker, said: “We lived simply, spent carefully and focused on giving our children (three daughters) a good education.”\n\nDespite the financial struggle, they ensured their children received opportunities they never had. Today, their three daughters are all well-settled, with one living in Australia. Mr Nadaison and Mrs Soranam have six grandchildren.\n\nThrough the years, they also supported each other’s interests.\n\nAn avid runner, Mr Nadaison has participated in over 40 long-distance races, more than 100 half-marathons, and continues to run even in his eighties.\n\n“My wife knows how much I love running, so as long as I take care of myself, she lets me continue,” he said with a smile.\n\nMrs Soranam added that a good marriage also means respecting each other’s independence.\n\nAccording to the couple, the success of a lasting marriage, whether arranged or based on love, depends on mutual understanding and the ability to handle differences without letting misunderstandings escalate.\n\n“Even in an arranged marriage, love and affection can grow over time,” said Mrs Soranam.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8caf917f00cffd9a8e3b0b2f7d7a1da8c2f62379ac3edc53f2e0d30c4ce4a121?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The road down the winding Pasarni Ghat would take at least half an hour – time he didn’t have to spare.\n\nMahangde approached Mr Govind Yewale, a man who organises paragliding sessions in the area, and pleaded with him to lend a paraglider.\n\nThe 19-year-old was strapped on to a paraglider and he made it to the grounds of the exam centre in five minutes and rushed to complete his exam, reported The Times of India.\n\nA video of the incident, which circulated on social media, shows the man soaring through the sky with his knapsack, ready to make a dramatic entrance at his exam centre.\n\nMahangde runs a juice centre at Harrison’s Folly point, a scenic spot along Pasarni Ghat connecting Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar. Harrison’s Folly is also a paragliding centre that sees hundreds of tourists during the weekends.\n\n“My first semester paper was earlier cancelled and I was not aware of the changed date as I could not get my hall ticket updated. While I was at work, I got to know about it from my friends,” Mahangde told the Times of India.\n\nHe added that if he had taken the conventional route to his exam centre he would have surely missed the exam because of the traffic.\n\nMr Yewale, who is also from Pasarni village, said he knew the youngster well and scolded him over the exam matter before lending him the paragliding equipment.\n\n“Then I asked one of the paragliders to help him. He landed on the grounds of the centre just 10 minutes before the exam,” Mr Yewale said.\n\n“I asked another person to rush to get Samarth’s hall ticket, writing pad and pens from his house. The traffic, one-way towards Panchgani, was moving very slow owing to road works.”\n\nSamarth said: “I study in a college affiliated to Shivaji University, Kolhapur. I work to support my family. My education is equally important.”\n\nSatara Superintendent of Police Samir Shaikh denied there was any traffic congestion during that time, and implied that it was all a social media stunt.\n\nBut on Instagram, the video is nearing one million views and has received numerous comments, reported NDTV.\n\n“His name should be added to the world record,” said one Instagram user.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/efc161d488afc8b104da9815551d426ab976d99483fbb63810f178e658a68211?w=825", "alt_text": "Samarth Mahangade’s stunt was filmed and shared on social media."}]}

Kavi\n\nயோகிதா அன்புச்செழியன்\n\nIn the 1970s, as Mr Jagtar Singh peered out his window, he noticed a family moving furniture into the flat above his. Without much thought, he and his younger brother rushed to lend a hand.\n\nAmid the boxes and bustle, he locked eyes with 14-year-old Balvinder Kaur, the second eldest daughter of the family.\n\n“I remember seeing him and thinking that he looked very handsome, like a Bollywood hero,” said Mrs Balvinder, now 68, with a laugh.\n\nThough they lived just a floor apart, they were not formally introduced until her father encouraged her to make friends in the Whampoa neighborhood. Over the years, their friendship blossomed into something more.\n\nFast forward 50 years, the pair was among 202 couples honoured at the Golden Jubilee Wedding Celebrations on Feb 16. The event, held at the Raffles City Convention Centre, recognised couples who had been married in Singapore for at least five decades.\n\nMr Jagtar and Mrs Balvinder’s courtship was adorably old-fashioned. Without the convenience of smartphones or social media, Mr Jagtar would pass tiny notes to her through his younger brother, arranging to meet whenever possible.\n\nSince her father was strict, Mrs Balvinder often had to be discreet. “I would tell my family I was going for sewing classes and my sisters helped cover for me,” she said.\n\nMr Jagtar would ride his scooter down to pick her up, and the two lovebirds would spend time together before she had to return home.\n\n“There was no dramatic proposal or courtship,” Mr Jagtar, 76, said. “It was just a mutual understanding between us that we would eventually get married.”\n\nWhen her father finally found out about their relationship, the reaction was not as harsh as they had feared. Mr Jagtar, a police constable by that time, was seen as a steady, responsible man.\n\n“My in-laws trusted that I would take good care of her, and I took it to heart to never break that trust,” he said.\n\nThey got married in September 1974 when Mrs Balvinder turned 18.\n\nTheir early years as a married couple were filled with simple joys – quiet evening drives to Marina Reservoir and ice cream dates at coffeeshops.\n\nThe couple have a 45-year-old daughter and two grandchildren.\n\nAt the event on Feb 16, many, including Mr Jagtar and Mrs Balvinder, took the opportunity to renew their vows, reaffirming their love in the presence of family and friends.\n\nEach participating couple received a commemorative package, including a certificate, a gold medallion, a congratulatory note and a photo memento.\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his wife Jane Ittogi, and Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli graced the occasion, which was jointly organised by the Families for Life Council, the Registry of Marriages and the Registry of Muslim Marriages.\n\nMr Jagtar, who was a policeman for 27 years, always had a passion for the culinary arts – a love that began in his youth when he helped his father run a humble food stall.\n\nIn 1998, with help from his wife, he opened Riverwalk Tandoor, a North Indian restaurant in Rangoon Road that remains popular today.\n\nIn recent years, they have left the running of the restaurant to their daughter and nephews, and spend their retirement days keeping each other company.\n\nFrom time to time, they still go on evening drives.\n\n“We still enjoy our simple drives.

Talks are ongoing for the remaining 128 migrants to find alternative destinations.

After a while, I slept in the shed next to the cows almost every night.\n\n“The shed is dusty and there are many mosquitoes – but those things never bothered me too much. Even today, when I know a cow is about to give birth, I make sure to stay in the shed every day to monitor it.”\n\nToday, Viknesh fully manages Viknesh Dairy Farm, a dairy farm in Singapore situated on the outskirts of Lim Chu Kang. With around 60 cows, the farm primarily produces milk and curd for commercial purposes.\n\nFor the last three decades, the farm was run by his father Govindasamy Subramaniam, 74. However, due to the latter’s deteriorating health, Viknesh, who has two older sisters, knew that he couldn’t let the farm fade into obscurity.\n\nThough serendipitous, the farm was actually named after Viknesh’s elder brother, who died before Viknesh was born.\n\n“My family believes that I am the reincarnation of my late elder brother, Vikneshwaran. So my parents named me and also the farm as such,” he explained.\n\nViknesh Dairy Farm is the only cow farm in Singapore that caters to religious events. During Pongal (Hindu harvest festival) every year, for instance, cows from the farm are brought to Little India for public viewing.\n\nWork at the farm is gruelling and long, and the rewards are far from immediate, said Viknesh. He also faces the realities of farming in an urban landscape – rising costs, dwindling land space and an industry that is increasingly viewed as old-fashioned.\n\n“It is not easy. We have to make sure the cattle stay healthy and we adhere to all the government guidelines,” said Viknesh.\n\nIn school, as his friends talked about careers in tech, finance, engineering and of opportunities that seemed more glamorous than life on a farm, Viknesh’s passion for rural life never waned.\n\n“It’s the bond I developed over the years with my family and the business,” the former ACS (Barker) student said. “Very quickly, it became who I was.”\n\nViknesh became heavily involved in the farm operations soon after his O’ Levels, when he was 16 – due to his father’s health. After completing his diploma in electrical engineering at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, he went into the family business full-time.\n\n“Most of my friends are pursuing their degrees in universities, but for me the dairy farm means everything,” he said.\n\n“While they go clubbing or on holidays, I handle the operations of the farm and take care of the cattle. I do not see this as a sacrifice.\n\n“Some of my friends tease me about spending so much of my time with the cows, but they don’t understand the love I have for the animals.”\n\nHis favourite animal is a bull named Murugan.\n\n“I used to spend a lot of time with him when I was young; I would pull its tail, tickle his body and even play catch with him,” Viknesh said.\n\nPlans are afoot for the farm to be relocated soon, and Viknesh has plans to open the premises for guided tours.\n\n“I want to upgrade the farm to attract more people, especially school students and tourists,” he said.\n\n“I hope more people can learn about farm life and what we do around here.”\n\n“While my friends go clubbing or on holidays, I handle the operations of the farm and take care of the cattle.

The latter are known as backseat drivers – people who are convinced they know the roads, traffic rules and vehicle mechanics better than you do.\n\nThe family GPS\n\nBackseat drivers come in many forms, but none are as legendary as the “Indian family GPS”. A mother, father, aunt, uncle or the most formidable one, a spouse who sits in the passenger seat, issuing a steady stream of commentary. “Turn left! No, not this left! The next left! Arrey, why are you braking so suddenly? You are driving too fast! This is not an F1 track! You think you are Lewis Hamilton? Why are you driving so slow? A snail just overtook us!”\n\nIt doesn’t matter how well you’re driving, they will always find something to correct.\n\nThe spouse GPS\n\nI admit, I am a backseat driver, but I’m really just a loving guide. Honestly, I don’t like my husband to drive our small but very expensive car (thanks to the high car taxes we pay in Singapore). I’d rather he take the BMW (Bus, MRT, Walk).\n\nFor one, I’ve noticed the car always comes back with scratches. Though he won’t admit it, my husband’s really not a good driver. I have no choice but to patiently guide him when I’m in the passenger seat. Sometimes with gritted teeth.\n\n“Honey, you’re following too closely behind that car.”\n\n“Why is there such a big gap? People will keep cutting in!”\n\n“You always drive so recklessly! I knew I should have driven.”\n\nAnd this is why so many husbands take public transport. The MRT doesn’t trigger divorce proceedings.\n\nThe Singapore parking confusion\n\nSingapore’s parking rules are like an advanced-level IQ test that nobody signed up for. Double yellow lines, single yellow lines, zigzag lines – each with their own important meaning that somehow everyone forgets when looking for a parking spot.\n\nNow, picture this: My husband is driving and I’m in the back seat.\n\nMe: Okay, here’s a spot...\n\nHusband: No, cannot! Double yellow line! You want to go to jail?\n\nMe: But everyone has parked here!\n\nHusband: That’s because its CNY! We cannot park there.\n\nMe (pointing to a small gap between cars): How about there?\n\nHusband: No, no, jagged line! That’s for emergency vehicles. They will tow your car faster than you can say “summon”!\n\nMe: Fine! What about this one?\n\nHusband: Single yellow line… can park, but only after 7pm.\n\nMe: It’s 6:59pm.\n\nHusband: Wait one minute. I shall drive around in circles.\n\nBackseat driving: A national sport\n\nYou will find backseat drivers everywhere – giving perfectly unnecessary instructions to taxi uncles, Grab drivers and even strangers.\n\n“Uncle, I think you can take a shortcut through Little India.”\n\n(Driver ignores the comment)\n\n“Uncle, I think that’s a one-way road, but you can try lah.”\n\nTaxi drivers in Singapore have mastered the art of nodding politely while completely disregarding their passengers. The Grab app may have GPS navigation, but many riders believe their gut feeling is more reliable.\n\nThe phone navigation expert\n\nThen there’s the tourist who insists on navigating using Google Maps, even when the driver has lived in Singapore their entire life.\n\n“Wait, wait, turn right here!”\n\n“There’s no road there.”\n\n“Oh… okay, then maybe in 500m? No, wait, that was the turn! Why didn’t you turn?”\n\nThe parking struggle\n\nSingapore has some of the tightest parking spaces in the world, which makes parallel parking doubly stressful. But it can sometimes get catastrophic when your family is in the car.\n\nOnce, while parallel parking in Little India, I got the full family choir performance: “Go left. Go right. Straighten the steering wheel now!”\n\nMy tyre ended up in the drain. Fortunately, some kind migrant workers helped lift the car out.\n\nThe long-distance backstreet driver\n\nBackstreet driving isn’t limited to passengers inside the car – it has gone global, thanks to children who have moved abroad but still need to control how their parents drive back home over the phone (hands-free, of course).\n\n“Papa, why aren’t you using Google Maps? You still rely on Uncle Sharma’s directions?”\n\n“Maa, please don’t drive at night! You know your night vision isn’t great.”\n\nConclusion: How to survive a backseat driver\n\nDealing with backseat drivers requires patience, selective hearing and sometimes, noise-cancelling headphones.

When given a rare chance to attend school, she is forced to make a decision that alters her and her sister’s lives for good.\n\nSet in India, the story sheds light on the struggles of working children, highlighting their hopes for a better life. In just 23 minutes, director Adam J. Graves crafts a poignant narrative that resonates beyond its runtime, leaving a strong emotional impact.\n\nThe film premiered last August and has recently made waves online following its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film at the 97th Academy Awards this year. It dropped on Netflix on Feb 5.\n\nActs Of God\n\nPrimarily a stand-up comedian from India, Kanan Gill believes being a writer was his original calling. As far as his debut novel proves, we shouldn’t doubt him.\n\nActs Of God explores themes surrounding dystopian worlds interspersed with science-fiction and humour, and critics have lauded him as a novelist and for his inventiveness and story-building skills – all while wryly questioning the nature of our existence. The book currently holds a 4.4 out of 5 star rating on Amazon.\n\nFor those not familiar with Gill’s comedic material and relatable anecdotes about Indian life, watch his “There is a cow” bit on YouTube –\n\n“You are on one side of the road. On the other side is progress. But in the middle, there is a cow.

From the stage, Draupadi locks eyes with her and in a loud and enraged voice accuses her of being a cowardly bystander: “Bhishma, how dare you stay silent while you allow this to happen to a woman!”\n\nThe audience member gulps as the attention of 200 theatregoers falls on her. Thankfully, a second spotlight shines on someone else in the right corner of the theatre, and Draupadi redirects her rage towards them.\n\nOn Feb 14 and 15, the theatre stage at School of the Arts (Sota) transformed into an ancient Indian court in 3000 BC as it played venue to Yajnaseni – The Eternal Flame, starring renowned bharatanatyam dancer Meera Balasubramanian.\n\nIt is a dance-drama that narrates the extraordinary life of Draupadi, the fierce heroine of the Indian epic Mahabharata. The word Yajnaseni means “a woman born out of fire” and is another name for Draupadi.\n\nMeera, who runs the Kalpavriksha Fine Arts Academy and recently represented Singapore at the Asean Performing Arts Festival in Cambodia, plays the protagonist as well as other characters, often in the same scene. The cast also includes an ensemble of six supporting dancers.\n\nThe two-hour show unfolds across five acts, covering the birth of Draupadi and her unorthodox marriage to the five Pandavas. The story concludes with the mourning of her children who died in the Kurukshetra War and her ascension to heaven.\n\nTold through Draupadi’s point of view, the production is a bold and modern feminist interpretation of the Mahabharata. In the classic Indian epic, Draupadi, though a significant character, is typically portrayed as a supporting role in relation to the male characters. In Yajnaseni, she is front and centre.\n\nIn Act 3, after being the object of a lost bet to the Kauravas, Draupadi confronts the antagonists in court for their inaction, and chastises her husbands for not defending her honour. Meera demonstrates her prowess as she switches between three characters – Duryodhana, Karna and Draupadi – seamlessly.\n\nHer gestures and facial expressions encapsulate the antagonistic Karna when he ridicules Draupadi for her polyandrous marriage. Yet, she is able to play the righteous Draupadi with a nuanced sense of strength and vulnerability.\n\nThe show ran for two nights – a Tamil version was staged first – to sold-out audiences.\n\nThe music, which included songs specially composed for the production, was scored by O.S. Arun and Eswar Ramakrishnan, while the dance sequences were choreographed by Meera along with senior dancer Hari Padman.\n\nFor the English version, the show drew an audience of both young and old. Student Anupama, 18, said she thought the dialogue was particularly engaging.\n\n“The facial expressions, lighting and display of exposition (story text) on the projector made the plot easy to follow,” she added.\n\n“I definitely liked the part where the spotlight shone on the audience and Draupadi confronted them. At one point, I was so afraid it would fall on me.”\n\nSakti Singaravelu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9f536fd2773d33fc963a1a48c2d928d66bb2efda7c7f886d1018afa869814123?w=825", "alt_text": "Meera Balasubramanian as Draupadi in Yajnaseni."}]}

But she was able to impose powerful groundstrokes on older, more experienced opponents with ease.\n\nThis feat made Maaya the first player born in 2009 or after to reach the top four in an event of such calibre. She will also be ranked inside the top 700 after her historic run, making her the youngest Indian to earn a WTA ranking.\n\nBorn on June 12, 2009, in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, Maaya’s foray into tennis began as a casual after-school playtime activity. It quickly turned into a serious pursuit when she was just eight years old.\n\nHer natural talent and passion for the sport led her to train under former India No. 1 K.G. Ramesh before going on to join the Pro Serve Tennis Academy under coach Manoj Kumar.\n\nBy the age of 10, Maaya had already set her sights on a professional tennis career. Fast forward a few years, and she seems well on track.\n\nA regular on the junior circuit since 2022, Maaya won five junior titles (four J60s and one J100) in 2023. She also earned an invitation to the Australian Open Under-14 showcase that year. A year later, she made her junior Grand Slam debut in Melbourne but was knocked out in the first round of the qualifiers.\n\nTo further refine her game, Maaya trained at the Rafa Nadal Tennis Academy in Mallorca for a week in 2024. Her impressive showing there earned her a one-year training contract with the prestigious institution.\n\nHaving the opportunity to watch Rafael Nadal train up close during the Davis Cup 2024 Finals in Mallorca also left a profound mark on the youngster.\n\n“It’s one of my most favourite memories. Even a man that’s won so much, he’s still got that hunger and that’s really impressive,” Maaya said.\n\nIncidentally, Maaya’s game style also draws heavily from Nadal. Like the Spanish icon, the Indian teenager is also an aggressive baseline player and uses her powerful groundstrokes to dictate rallies.\n\nAmong Indian tennis players, Maaya idolises Sania Mirza, India’s most successful women’s tennis player.\n\n“If you say you’re a tennis player in India, it’s her name that always pops up in response,” she said. “It’s her I’ve always looked up to as an Indian athlete.”\n\nMaaya, who enjoys learning history in school and loves trekking, wants to follow Mirza’s footsteps and win Grand Slams.\n\n“Win Slams and end up as World No. 1,” she said. “That’s where it all ends.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a03d6bece483d48df8d97254913ff27a28e7a5963b3d0f9329a8fafb403fc629?w=825", "alt_text": "Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi"}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingapore’s leading comic couple Rishi Budhrani and Sharul Channa will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary next month in style – with a dual show at the newly renovated Esplanade Concert Hall on March 21.\n\n“We will be tackling themes of family, relationships, dating, current affairs, politics and, of course, marriage,” said Rishi. “Both of us are very different comedians and will bring our own styles to the show.\n\n“You can expect Sharul’s high-energy rapid fire-style of cutting comedy, along with my satirical take on current affairs and culture. And, needless to say, there will be a global, yet, Singaporean-Indian viewpoint present in both acts.”\n\nThe pair have performed together twice before – at the Goodman Arts Centre in 2015 and the Capitol Theatre in 2020.\n\nRishi and Sharul are coming off the back of taking their dual show globally for the first time in a decade. They recently performed to packed houses in Bengaluru, Cape Town and Jakarta.\n\n“Actually, it feels very comfortable to be celebrating our 10th anniversary,” said Rishi. ”It’s like wearing your old, oversized T-shirt to bed. Honestly, we forgot about this milestone until we were planning for our show’s marketing. So, it’s almost become a part of our existence at this point.”\n\nSharul said it’s great to be Singapore’s “only married” stand-up comedy couple.\n\n“We think every couple is funny, and if you don’t have a sense of humour, it makes daily life and long term relationships difficult to sustain,” she said. “The difference is, as a married couple we get paid to be funny. We wish the government would give us a grant or a rebate or a bonus for being a married comedy couple. Instead of a baby bonus, maybe a joke bonus?”\n\nHaving dated for eight years before their wedding, the couple feel they have come a long way together, and have offered tips to other couples: “Ignore each other from time to time; constructive ignorance is a powerful tool in healthy long-term relationships,” said Rishi.\n\n“Roast and make fun of each other regularly and pick your battles – you can’t fight over everything. And love your in-laws, or at least try.\n\n“If, on those rough days, you are not able to see the funny side of things, then you might go nuts. A sense of humour is that ‘jadibuti’, or special potion, that helps ease the strain of marriage.”\n\nThe Rishi and Sharul Show 3 also has an SG60 connection.\n\n“We have grown up with Singapore over the years, and so has our relationship – through the struggles, through the difficulties,” said Sharul. “We figured it’s a good way to commemorate this milestone by sharing the one thing we know we can give Singapore unconditionally – laughter.”\n\n“There was a time when people said we wouldn’t make it, but we did,” she added, humourously referencing a line from a famous National Day song.\n\nTheir ultimate goal is to encourage Singaporeans to laugh and fall in love.\n\n“People are just taking themselves too seriously – on dates, in relationships, on social media,” said Sharul. “And because we take it all too seriously, it’s affecting our fertility rate.\n\n“We encourage Singaporeans, especially the GenZs, to laugh at themselves a bit more, because if you can laugh at yourself, you can love yourself, and only if you can love yourself, can you fall in love with someone else.

The 20-year-old computer science student allegedly died by suicide after being harassed by a 21-year-old male student, authorities said.\n\nPolice later arrested the male student – the son of a civil engineer in Lucknow – and lodged a case against him for allegedly abetting the suicide. He was sent to 14 days’ judicial custody.\n\nHowever, the controversy escalated after university authorities cracked down on protesting Nepali students and closed the hostel for them, effectively asking them to leave.\n\nVideos circulating on social media showed one professor saying that the university provides free meals to 40,000 students, which is more than Nepal’s GDP, and another comparing KIIT’s spending on students to be bigger than Nepal’s national budget.\n\nSome students also alleged that security personnel beat them up and threw them out of the hostel, prompting Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to intervene on Monday.\n\nPolice said the accused abetted the suicide of the female student.\n\n“We are waiting for the post-mortem report,” said Bhubaneswar Deputy Commissioner of Police Pinak Mishra.\n\n“Two cases have been lodged on charges of abetment of suicide and alleged manhandling of students. The cases are under investigation.”\n\nAn audio clip went viral on social media in which the accused could purportedly be heard abusing and making derogatory comments about the victim and her mother.\n\nThe father of the victim, who arrived in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday, confirmed the allegations of harassment and said her daughter was harassed and emotionally blackmailed by her fellow student.\n\n“My daughter is no more, but I pray no other Nepali student faces such a fate. Other national and international students are continuing their studies at the university. No such incidents should ever be heard in the future,” he said.\n\n“I hope justice prevails. We have full faith and confidence in the government and police administration here,” he said.\n\nIn connection with the protest, police arrested five people, including the university’s director general and director of administration, but they were released later in the day.\n\nThe university said it suspended Ms Jayanti Nath, the director of the girl’s hostel, and associate professor of computer science Manjusha Pandey over their unsavoury comments on Nepal.\n\nThe senior administrative officer of the international relations office, who allegedly did not take any action against the accused despite a complaint by the female student five weeks ago, was also suspended.\n\nA statement signed by the school’s vice-chancellor Saranjit Singh read: “We are extremely appalled by the untoward incident on our campus on the evening of Feb 16. We are also regretful of the way some of us behaved towards the agitating students. The comments made by two of our officers are extremely irresponsible. We have removed them from service.\n\n“We, too, apologise for all that has happened and hereby tender our love and affection to all the students and people of Nepal.”\n\nA separate statement signed by registrar J.R. Mohanty said police have apprehended the accused. “The KIIT administration has taken all-out efforts to restore normalcy in the campus and hostels to resume academic activities. An appeal is made to all our Nepali students who have or planned to leave the campus to resume the classes,” said Mr Mohanty.\n\nA third statement issued by the Indian Embassy in Nepal said that two security personnel – Ramakanta Nayak and Jogendra Behera – were removed from service and arrested by Odisha Police.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/ba332c5a683c55676ab21b12186ecb410726d367d6f93582424462fb7732ebd3?w=825", "alt_text": "Police personnel keeping vigil on the campus of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology amid protests, in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe last performance at the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society’s (Sifas) auditorium on Starlight Road, before the institution moves to Middle Road next month, was a bharatanatyam recital by Shreya Murthy.\n\nThe 21-year-old Singaporean, who is studying medicine at the University of Western Australia in Perth, captivated a packed hall during the special occasion on Saturday.\n\n“Sifas is like a second home to me,” she said. “My grandmother and mother grew up learning and performing there. It is a nostalgic and sentimental place to perform in. For every student who has studied at Sifas, it is close to the heart.”\n\nHer performance was preceded by a violin solo by former Sifas student Sreeranjani Muthu Subramanian.\n\nShreya began studying bharatnatyam at Sifas at age six. She later completed her eight-year diploma course in the dance form and earned the Natya Visharad (top student) title in 2019.\n\nShe did her arangetram (debut performance) at Sifas in February 2020, and went to Chennai in October that year to continue her learning with noted bharatanatyam exponent Priyadarshini Govind.\n\nNow she trains in Perth every day and performs in Chennai and the United States during her school holidays.\n\nShreya’s 105-minute performance on Saturday – which helped raise about $4,000 for Sifas – was appreciated by the audience.\n\n“Shreya exhibited precision, lightness and effortlessness in her movements, which belied the challenging physicality inherent in the choreography of her guru,” said senior dancer Lalitha Subramony. “The abhinaya pieces reflected the sheer hard work she has put in, beautifully capturing the subtle nuances and holding the audience’s attention with effective storytelling.”\n\nSifas will gradually move to its new campus from next month.

Kavi\n\nMr Dinesh Kumar has been carrying kavadis that he has made on his own for the past 20 years. This year, he attempted a “harigandam” kavadi for the first time during Thaipusam on Feb 11.\n\nThe word “kavadi” means burden, and devotees carry these beautifully-adorned wooden or metal arches to fulfill their vows to Lord Murugan, a major deity in the Tamil community, to whom the festival of Thaipusam is dedicated.\n\nThe harigandam kavadi requires the four main metal rods to be pierced directly into his waist. It is unlike the previous kavadis he has carried, which include the paal kavadi (semicircular wooden arches with milk pots attached at the sides), the chain kavadi (metal chains hooked into the skin with milk pots dangling on it) and the spike kavadi (where the four main metal rods are secured to a waist belt instead of being pierced).\n\n“I decided when I turned 40 that I wanted to try carrying the harigandam-style kavadi because for me, it was the next step,” he says.\n\nAssisting him was Mr Kathirasan Shanmugam, a piercing specialist who has been building kavadis for 40 years.\n\nMr Kathirasan has a stern countenance as he readies a long metal rod with a sharpened tip. He has already marked with holy ash where the rod is supposed to pierce Mr Dinesh’s body.\n\nAnother specialist kneels down and pinches the lower abdomen. In one smooth motion, Mr Kathirasan pierces the rod in almost surgical fashion. There is no bleeding, even as Mr Dinesh winces ever so slightly.\n\nThe step is repeated three times before the team of specialists lift up and rest the arched metal kavadi, colloquially referred to as the “pumpkin”, on top of Mr Dinesh’s cushion-padded shoulders.\n\nMr Kathirasan’s steady hand is impressive, especially considering it was less than a few hours ago when he was the one being pierced. He too carried a harigandam kavadi.\n\n“I personally think the harigandam kavadi is more convenient because it remains stationary throughout the procession,” Mr Kathirasan says.\n\nHis devotion to kavadi-making began as a child as he watched his father build kavadis for close friends. When he turned 18 in 1985 and expressed his desire to carry a kavadi, his father insisted he had to build his own.\n\nInterestingly, Mr Kathirasan says he has no particular vows in mind when he makes the 3.2km pilgrimage from Sri Srinivasa Temple to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road every year. “I worship Murugan steadfastly… I believe the more we do for God, the more he takes care of our family,” he explains.\n\nTo his family, Thaipusam is more important than Deepavali, and it is when extended family members gather to help with the kavadi-building.\n\nThe entire process begins a month before Thaipusam. Each year, Mr Kathirasan adds a new component to his kavadi. This year, he included more pattais (gold-plated brass pieces) to his kavadi by adding a third deck on top.\n\nThe women of the household assist with the stonework and polishing of the pattais. It is meticulous and time-consuming work because each tiny gemstone needs to be glued on by hand with a tweezer.\n\nThe men assemble the structure. The metal arches and rods need not be changed every year but the rods have to be properly sanitised and sharpened before each use.\n\n“When you create it yourself, there is an indescribable satisfaction,” says Mr Kathirasan.\n\nMr Dinesh and Mr Kathirasan hope to pass down the family tradition of making kavadis to the next generation.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe visit of three Indian naval ships to Singapore last week not only strengthened defence ties, but also enhanced the relationship between the citizens of both countries.\n\nOn Feb 7, 300 residents and staff of the Sree Narayana Mission (SNM) Nursing Home in Chong Pang were treated to meals prepared by the cooks on board the INS Sujata, INS Shardul and ICGS Veera, which berthed at the Changi Naval Base for three days as part of their Long-Range Training Deployment to South East Asia.\n\nThe meals were delivered to the residents by officers from the Indian Navy’s First Training Squadron (1TS).\n\nThe initiative was led by Captain Saikat Chatterjee, defence attache at the High Commission of India in Singapore.\n\n“The gesture was intended to promote the Indian Navy’s commitment to giving back to the community,” said an HCI spokesman. “The vegetarian meals were meticulously prepared and packed onboard the 1TS ships by skilled chefs.”\n\nThe programme included a briefing about the SNM’s activities by CEO S. Devendran. This was followed by the naval officers interacting with department heads, distributing the meals to the residents and exchanging mementos.\n\n“The visit underscored the shared values of compassion and service upheld in the highest esteem by both organisations,” the HCI spokesman said.\n\nSNM resident Narinder Singh said “the food was great”.\n\n“I’m looking forward to them visiting us again,” he said. “I chatted with the officers about the meals and how they prepare it. It was really enjoyable.”\n\nThe officers also interacted with the nursing home’s Residents’ Committee, which oversees decisions on daily operational matters.\n\n“I wish to thank the Indian Navy’s First Training Squadron for the wonderful gesture of providing lunch prepared by the ship’s galleys for the residents and staff, said Mr Devendran.\n\n“I also wish to thank the High Commission of India for facilitating the CSR activity. SNM has always enjoyed a strong rapport with the High Commission which has always been supportive of the Mission’s charitable work.\n\n“On a personal note, the CSR activity is particularly significant to me because I am a foreign alumnus of India’s National Defence Academy and the current Chief of the Indian Navy (Admiral Dinesh K. Tripathi) is my course mate.”\n\nThe visit of the Indian naval ships marked an important step in enhancing maritime cooperation and fostering deeper mutual understanding between India and Singapore.\n\nThe squadron had previously visited Singapore in October 2023.\n\nThe ships and crew participated in several activities designed to improve cooperation and interoperability between the Indian Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). These included joint training sessions and friendly sports games.\n\nThe Indian Navy personnel also toured the Navy Museum, which offered an opportunity to explore Singapore’s maritime heritage, and paid tribute at the Kranji War Memorial, where wreaths were laid honouring the fallen soldiers, highlighting the shared history and mutual respect between the two nations.\n\nOfficers from Indian Navy’s Training Squadron No. 1 interacting with SNM’s Residents’ Committee\n\nPhoto: Sree Narayana Mission (Singapore)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a383b93e32aecd74a7c771fb198651c14dccd055a3c43b42105215ab8a21bd9a?w=825", "alt_text": "Personnel from Indian Navy’s First Training Squadron serving residents at SNM Nursing Home@Chong Pang."}]}

Shanmugam, who was guest of honour at the festival, commended the arrangements, but noted that “something can be done” about the long waiting periods to enter the temple in Tank Road.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines, Mr Shanmugam said: “Quite a few people mentioned that they were waiting for a very long time. The elderly and those carrying milk said they had been waiting for two, 2½,even three hours.”\n\nMr Shanmugam said he met with the management of both temples involved to discuss possible solutions.\n\n“The main issue is that when people come in front of the deity at the sanctum, they want to spend some time. If they are asked to leave quickly – after having waited for hours – they understandably want at least four or five minutes. You can imagine if 10 people spend five minutes each, that’s an hour.”\n\nHe added: “The two temples, the Hindu Endowments Board, as well as the management of the Tank Road temple, will need to come together to explore solutions – perhaps using technology or releasing people in batches.”\n\nRemarking that he does not yet know “what is feasible”, he said he would speak with the authorities to see what could be done.\n\nIn a joint statement by Sri Thendayuthapani Temple, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, and Hindu Endowments Board, a spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the comments made by Mr Shanmugam on the importance of reducing wait time to improve the experience during Thaipusam.\n\n“We recognise that many devotees faced prolonged wait times to reach the sanctum to fulfil their vows. We deeply appreciate their patience and devotion.\n\n“To address this, we will conduct a thorough review of this year’s Thaipusam arrangements, analysing both the ground logistics and operational challenges. Feedback will be sought from devotees and other stakeholders to help us identify areas for improvement.\n\n“The safety, well-being, and comfort of all devotees remain our highest priority. We are committed to improving the Thaipusam experience while preserving its significance as a sacred and meaningful celebration.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/higher-turnout-sees-delays-confusion-temple?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Though hearing aids helped her left ear, it did nothing for the right side.\n\n“But my teacher was very supportive and encouraged me to not give up.”\n\nShe took her piano lessons seriously and never missed a lesson. Her goal was to become a piano teacher.\n\n“Many of my friends were confused when I told them what I wanted to be. Some would even ask me bluntly, ‘how can you become a piano teacher?’ But I kept the faith.”\n\nThings improved for her audibly, when at the age of 19 she went for a cochlear implant surgery in her right ear. However, the stress from processing two different sounds from each ear – the cochlear one sounding more “machine-like” – almost pushed her to depression. It took her a year to adjust and while her hearing is now close to normal, it is still not 100 per cent.\n\nParvin eventually attained a grade eight in piano – the minimum requirement to teach the instrument – from The Association Board of the Royal Schools of Music.\n\nShe currently works as a private piano teacher, and has been a pianist and percussionist for the Soka New Century Orchestra since 2010.\n\nShe also teaches students with disabilities at ART:DIS, a non-profit dedicated to creating opportunities for persons with disabilities in the arts.\n\n“From my personal experience, I can understand how people with disabilities are struggling to cope with their daily life,” Ms Parvin said. “I hope I can inspire and motivate them to fulfil their dreams.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/789d2c3eab54e7139f47fb092ae56b086ee45474576695d5cf90f844ed60c922?w=825", "alt_text": "Parvinderjeet Kaur, who as a child was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss in her left ear and profound deafness in her right ear."}]}

The two share much in common, with both campaigning on promises to promote the interests of their countries’ majority communities over minorities and both doggedly pursuing critics.\n\nIn February 2020, Mr Modi invited Trump before a cheering crowd of more than 100,000 people to inaugurate the world’s largest cricket stadium in his home state of Gujarat.\n\nMr Trump could visit India later this year for a scheduled summit of the Quad _ a four-way grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the United States.\n\nAFP\n\n“Mr Modi has prepared for this (to tackle the US president’s rage against India over trade), and he is seeking to preempt Trump’s anger.”\n\nMs Lisa Curtis, the National Security Council director on South Asia during Mr Trump’s first term.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3726da5700188c4b0dda752daec80181dbc3028df99044b495f356d3b76c725f?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (left) with United States President Donald Trump during a bilateral meeting in Biarritz, France, on Aug 26, 2019."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhen Gibu George received a call from a casting agent in January last year asking if he was interested in auditioning for a part in a music video featuring a band, he thought to himself, “why not”.\n\nThe Singapore permanent resident, who has acted in three Malayalam films and seven English and Malayalam short films, was selected for the part a week later – but still, he had no idea who the band was or where they were from.\n\n“I had no clue what the video was even about,” he told tabla!. “Nevertheless, I decided I would do the shoot.”\n\nSoon, he was told to meet the producers at a spot near the Singapore Flyer. There, he found out a team of 25 actors was involved in the shoot.\n\n“We were asked to sign a non-disclosure form, and told that we would be taking part in a video for a European band,” said Gibu. “Even then I wasn’t bothered which band it was.”\n\nFrom the Singapore Flyer they were ferried in a boat to a small floating platform in the middle of Marina Bay. Gibu was the first to step out of the boat, and he was greeted by a man he couldn’t recognise at first.\n\n“He looked familiar, and then I realised that it was none other than Coldplay’s frontman Chris Martin,” said Gibu. “He made it a point to receive each one of us warmly.”\n\nFrom that moment on, it was four hours of “pure thrills” for Gibu, who is an IT professional with a multinational company.\n\n“The 25 of us were to act like we were at a Coldplay concert,” said Gibu. “And actually it was so special because the four members of Coldplay played only for us.\n\n“To get a ticket to a Coldplay concert is so difficult. And here was the band playing exclusively for us. I had goosebumps. I was being paid to hang out with megastars.”\n\nAccording to Gibu, who did not want to reveal how much he was paid, Martin made them all “feel at home”.\n\n“He sat with us and chatted and copied our steps,” said Gibu. “He even allowed one of us to play his guitar.\n\n“People look at Chris Martin like he’s a god. But there he was moving around without even shoes. He made us so comfortable that we felt like we were a part of the band.\n\n“I used to hear Coldplay songs on and off but was never a diehard fan. But, from that day on, they became my favourite band.”\n\nThe next day, Gibu was asked to go to a coffee shop in Chinatown. There, director Ben Mor asked him to act out a scene, where he had to make fun of a waitress who was frustrated with life. As he jokes with her, she throws a glass of water at him.\n\n“Both the shoots went so well that Coldplay gave us free tickets for their sixth and final show in Singapore during their Music of the Spheres World Tour in January 2024,” said Gibu. “The show was simply spectacular.\n\n“I then realised why fans around the world love them so much. I became hooked to their music and elevated their songs to No. 1 in my playlist.”\n\nA year later, the video featuring Gibu was released. Man In The Moon, from the extended Full Moon Edition of the band’s latest international No. 1 album Moon Music, was released on Feb 7.\n\nSet against Singapore’s vibrant multicultural backdrop, the video captures the song’s theme of unity and shared experiences that go beyond individual differences.\n\nThe video was filmed in collaboration with Warner Music Singapore and the Singapore Tourism Board. It features Singapore’s iconic cityscape from Marina Bay to Fort Canning Park, as well as other spots including People’s Park Complex, Jewel Changi Airport, Gardens by the Bay, hawker centres and residential neighbourhoods.\n\nSince the video was released, Gibu, who won the best actor award at the 2023 Barcelona International Film Festival for his role in the Singapore-made English short film The Wheel, has become a bit of a “mini-celeb”. People have been calling him up and congratulating him and asking about the entire filming experience.\n\n“I believe I played an important role in Man In The Moon because I was the only Indian actor and got to act in two scenes,” said Gibu.\n\n“The whole experience was pure magical for me. I have never felt like that before. Now I listen to that song every day – while at home, driving or whenever I have spare time.”\n\nGibu George (left) in the scene from the video where the waitress splashes water at him.\n\nPhoto: Screenshot on Youtube\n\n“To get a ticket to a Coldplay concert is so difficult.

Karthikeyan\n\nAnusha Selvamani\n\nIn a quiet corner of a bustling Christmas carolling session organised by a member of the Ang Mo Kio Tamil Methodist Church last December, Ashvath Asir Jeyaraj sits behind a keyboard and plays a few bars of a popular Christmas song.\n\nThe 14-year-old slouches as his fingers caress the keys and fidgets every few seconds – not quite the posture and motions of an orthodox piano player. But his playing is precise. He never misses a note.\n\nGuests at the HDB flat, numbering almost 20, pause their chatter for a few seconds as Ashvath starts to play, as if to acknowledge that a young musician has just stepped onto a dais. They resume their conversations as the music turns into atmospheric Muzak.\n\nWhen he finishes two songs, he saunters to a corner of the living room and joins the carolers. He doesn’t speak to them, and as the group begins to sing, he stares out into space.\n\nAshvath was diagnosed with autism just before he turned two, after his parents noticed some delays in his development as compared to a normal child.\n\nHis musical journey began one day when he was eight years old and watched a YouTube video of an orchestra, his father Samraj Asir Jeyaraj, 48, told tabla!\n\n“Moments later, he started playing the keyboard and mimicked the tunes he had just heard. He played the exact same song, note for note.”\n\nPrior to this, Ashvath had no formal musical training. Instead, he taught himself by ear, figuring out not just the keyboard but also the piano, organ, harmonica and pianica.\n\nWhen told of this the next day, his mother Ajita Merlyn Edward, 45, said she couldn’t quite believe the story.\n\n“I was already asleep the night Ashvath played the keyboard. Luckily, my husband had taken a video capturing the moment. When I saw the video, I was astounded,” she said.\n\n“Though we sing a lot of songs in church and play some music occasionally, none of us are professionally trained musicians in our family.”\n\nAshvath has undergone speech and occupational therapy, but music has been his way of communicating and it has given him the confidence, said Mr Asir, who works in the marine industry.\n\nHe added: “When we first learnt that our son has autism, my wife and I were disheartened. But eventually, we took it positively and did not see it as a flaw.\n\n“Ashvath is our precious son, especially since he was born five years after we got married. We did not plan to have more kids after him; we wanted to focus just on him.”\n\nA student of music himself, Mr Asir used to attend classes at the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society (Sifas), where he learnt to play the flute. Ashvath used to accompany his father to lessons and was tutored on the side by a music teacher there who saw his talent. The lessons ceased after the teacher returned to India.\n\nEventually, his parents enrolled him at Methodist School of Music in Bukit Timah, which caters to children with special needs.\n\nSince last July, Ashvath, who attends Lee Kong Chian Gardens, a special education school, has been learning how to compose music.\n\n“You know, there are many things I have learnt from my son,” Mr Asir said. “He has taught me how to accept the ups and downs of life and make the best of everything.\n\n“He doesn’t talk much, but when he plays music, it’s like he is speaking to the world.”\n\n“There are many things I have learnt from my son.

Assam has been growing at the rate of 19 per cent per year. And we have several plans to expand our economic growth further.”\n\nThe 56-year-old listed investment opportunities in hydrocarbon and petrochemicals, green energy, electronics, semi-conductors and tourism, among other industries.\n\nHe spoke about the openings in advanced manufacturing and semiconductors, which were placed at the heart of an updated cooperation between India and Singapore (the second India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable) on Aug 26 last year.\n\nThe chief minister highlighted the upcoming Electronics City in Jagiroad, a town in Assam, focusing on semiconductors and advanced electronics, which will set the state on a path to becoming a high-tech manufacturing hub.\n\nHe said the Jagiroad semiconductor plant’s Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test unit will foster innovation and industrial growth, and feature an electronics manufacturing cluster to support ancillary development and provide world-class facilities.

Tata Electronics setting up business in Assam is a fantastic start, as India doesn’t have the ecosystem in the semiconductor space. So, it is very important for outside people to understand that and see what are the opportunities to set up manufacturing units in India.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cd30c09fe595ac3bb2dcce588c893797f9f8bfaa80de4b191410d696d004037e?w=825", "alt_text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma."}]}

Events like the World Championship have always been Fide’s main event, then there’s the Grand Swiss and World Cup,” the Indian world No. 4 told the Hindustan Times. “The Freestyle Tour (Fischer Random format) seems very exciting with tournaments across continents and players like Magnus, Hikaru (Nakamura) and Fabiano (Caruana) participating.\n\n“I’ll be part of some Tour events, for sure. I’ll be playing the Paris edition. Even if (Fischer Random) is not the immediate future, it’s surely the future of chess for the next generation.”\n\nIn Fischer Random, also known as Chess960, the starting positions of pieces on the back rank are randomised, minimising the role of opening theory. It is a chess variation that randomises the starting position of the pieces. The goal is to encourage creativity and skill instead of memorising opening moves.\n\nFreestyle Chess Tour organisers and Fide have been feuding over the World Championship title. Freestyle chess has aspirations of awarding a “world champion” title to its Tour winner which Fide refused to relent to, calling the Championship its preserve.\n\nArjun, who is India’s top-ranked player, will be a part of the e-sports World Cup in Riyadh in July. It will be the first time that chess will be part of the event.\n\n“The way I look at it is, Freestyle chess is unique; it can fit in both as an e-sport as well as an over-the-board sport,” said Arjun. “This is the first time it’s being played as an e-sport so it definitely opens up new doors. I’m quite excited.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/989a7e97040cb1a33780567d877b272be85d2da774467d0d24bc121041b3d8e9?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi"}]}

Fans soon joined him and sang along, before a uniformed officer approached Sheeran and bent down to unplug the microphone.\n\nTwo men attempted to intervene, but the officer was undeterred. While Sheeran valiantly attempted to carry on with his performance, once his mic was cut, he smiled and shrugged in defeat.\n\nIn another video, Sheeran can be heard telling the crowd: “Everyone, we had permission to do this, but this policeman is shutting it down.”\n\nLocal authorities said that, while Sheeran had a permit to play at concerts, that did not extend to impromptu outdoor performances, reported AFP.\n\n“He is a very famous singer and naturally there will be chaos. To prevent that, police had not given him permission,” Karnataka’s Home Minister G. Parameshwara said on Monday.\n\n“In spite of that, he has come and tried to perform, so police prevented him.

It drew reactions from journalist and lyricist Neelesh Misra and Congress leader Supriya Shrinate, among others.\n\n“Decency is not incentivised in India – by platforms or audiences – and creators are stooping lower and lower for audience reach and revenue,” wrote Mr Misra.\n\nMs Shrinate called it pervert and worrying. “This isn’t creative. It’s pervert. And we can’t normalise perverse behaviour as cool. The fact that this sick comment met loud applause must worry us all,” she said.\n\nFollowing the row, Allahbadia issued an apology and said he “shouldn’t have said what he said”.\n\n“My comment wasn’t just inappropriate; it wasn’t even funny. Comedy is not my forte. I am just here to say sorry,” he said in a video statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, a team from the Assam Police reached Mumbai to question Allahabadia.\n\nThis comes after the Crime Branch in Guawahati on Monday registered a case against him and others for “promoting obscenity and engaging in sexually explicit and vulgar discussion”.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who runs two YouTube channels – Ranveer Allahbadia and BeerBiceps – has been badly affected by the episode.\n\nHe has lost more than 30,000 subscribers, and marketers pointed out that his remarks will cost him more subscribers, brand deals and a tarnished image.\n\nWhile the police continue with the investigations, Raina said that he has deleted all the episodes of his show from his YouTube channel, which had garnered millions of views.\n\nHe said that the recent events have been a bit too much for him to handle, adding that he will cooperate with investigative agencies.\n\n“My only objective was to make people laugh and have a good time.

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhen Achanta Sharath Kamal started playing for his national table tennis team in 2003, India were ranked 36th in the world. Today, he is aged 42, and India’s men’s and women’s teams figure in the top 10.\n\nOver the years, the ageless warrior has seen the steady rise of Indian table tennis in the international arena.\n\nBut 2024 was especially spectacular for him. Not only did the Indian men’s and women’s teams qualify for the Olympics for the first time, Manika Batra became the first Indian paddler to reach the last-16 in the women’s singles.\n\nEarlier in the year, the women’s team clinched a groundbreaking bronze at the Asian Table Tennis Championships in Kazakhstan, while Ayhika Mukherjee and Sutirtha Mukherjee won India’s first medal, a bronze, in the women’s doubles at the Asian Games.\n\n“We’ve been having fantastic results in recent years and that is thanks to support from the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI), the government, and, of course, the ecosystem that has been built,” said Kamal, who reached the quarter-final of the Singapore Smash in 2024 but was beaten by Taiwan’s Kao Cheng-Jui 2-3 in the first round of this year’s edition last week.\n\n“With sponsors coming in, we’ve come a long way from the time we did not have access to top-level training and tournaments,” said the 10-time national champion. “The most important change is that a player development infrastructure is in place and parents are pushing their children to take up table tennis.\n\n“When I started my career (at age 16), it was predominantly the coach who used to take care of physical and mental fitness, video analysis and everything else. But now, we have different departments and people for these jobs.\n\n“Also, before 2017, only a few players showed promise to reach the top level. Now we can see a bunch of juniors doing well, like Payas Jain (Under-17) and Manav Thakkar (Under-21) reaching world No. 1 in the junior rankings. The Indian league (Ultimate Table Tennis, launched in 2017) has also contributed a lot to our experience and confidence.”\n\nKamal, who is currently ranked 42, said the turning point came at the Rio Olympics in 2016, when India for the first time had four players in the main draw. “It was a shot in our arm, as the government noticed our abilities, and began to support us better,” he added.\n\nAt the same time, the Ultimate Table Tennis league gave Indian players a platform to partner with foreign players.\n\n“They got to practice with and play against better players. It was a fantastic launch pad for the youngsters,” said Kamal. “When they started beating the top players, they began to feel confident. Before that, they would always be scared playing against the stronger Asian and European players.”\n\nSoon after the league was formed, players such as Manika and Sathiyan Gnanasekaran broke the top-25 ceiling and led India to gold medals at the Commonwealth Games and lesser medals at the Asian Games.\n\nThe winning mentality was exemplified by Ayhika at the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Busan last year. Then ranked 155th, she stunned world No. 1 Sun Yingsha 3-1. In the same match against China, Sreeja Akula, ranked 49th, trounced world No. 2 Wang Yidi 3-0.\n\nThough India lost the tie 2-3, the two singles wins against the mighty Chinese made TTFI secretary-general Kamlesh Mehta exclaim that it was “the greatest day for Indian table tennis”.\n\nThe terrific showing not only helped the women qualify for the Paris Olympics, it also led to more children in India joining the sport.\n\nTo Kamal, who plans to become a coach after his playing days are over, table tennis in India may not reach the heights of cricket, but it can become as popular as badminton and tennis, sports which have produced Indian world champions and Grand Slam winners.\n\n“The sport is vastly different from the time I grew up when not many parents wanted their children to play table tennis,” he said.\n\n“Now, the outlook has changed. They are willing to take risks and invest more. And the youngsters are not holding themselves back. They want to win every match, as they feel they may not get a second chance.”\n\n“The sport is vastly different from the time I grew up when not many parents wanted their children to play table tennis.

Eventually, he lost that too.\n\nThis wasn’t just a one-off incident but a recurring occurrence for him back in 2016. Back then, to feed his casino addiction, he borrowed money from friends under the pretense of going for courses, and by 2019, he was over $10,000 in debt.\n\n“After gambling at the casino, I wouldn’t have any money to take a taxi, so I would walk from Marina Bay all the way to Little India, where I would sleep at the MRT station,” said Mr Arockiyasamy.\n\n“I had so many sleepless nights because of gambling. After I fell into debt, no one at home or outside respected me. I felt ashamed.”\n\nIt was only due to a timely intervention from his older brother, who confiscated his bank card and settled most of his debts, that Mr Arockiyasamy quit gambling. He went to the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) help centre in Serangoon Road, where he applied for a “casino self-exclusion”, which banned him from entering all casino premises.\n\nMr Arockiyasamy’s case is not an isolated one among migrant workers.\n\nAccording to the National Council On Problem Gambling (NCPG), as at Dec 31, 2023, “more than 155,000 active foreign workers are on casino self-exclusion” – 10 per cent of the over 1.5 million foreign workers in Singapore that year, including Employment Pass, S Pass and work permit holders.\n\nThe exclusion lasts for at least one year.\n\nToday, Mr Arockiyasamy said he has finally kicked the gambling habit for good, and wants to help others recover from their gambling addiction.\n\n“I regret that I lost contact with some of the people I still owe money to. I feel guilty about that even now,” he said.\n\nSelf-exclusion from casino premises is an option that migrant worker Elangovan Subbiah, 39, said he is mulling over.\n\nThe lorry driver stepped into a casino for the first time in 2023 “just for the fun of it”. Enticed by the roulette table and wheel, he placed small bets of $25 at first, but by the time he left the premises, he had lost around $1,400.\n\nEager to recoup his losses, Mr Subbiah returned to the casino shortly after and gambled from “morning to night”. On his second visit, he won $1,000 – but on his third attempt, he lost $1,600.\n\n“For 12 years, I did not even know where the casino was. I did not even think of going,” Mr Subbiah told tabla!\n\n“But once you start gambling, whether you can limit your losses depends on your own mindset. I know of someone who worked here and sold off his land in India to repay his gambling debts.”\n\nAs for the self-exclusion option, Mr Subbiah said: “It is our own responsibility to exercise self-control in gambling, rather than signing up for a forcible ban.”\n\n“What could also deter migrant workers from gambling at a casino is a $50 entry levy.”\n\nCurrently, casinos charge a daily entry levy of $150 and annual entry levy of $3,000 – but it applies only to Singapore citizens and permanent residents.\n\nIn response to this suggestion, NCPG chairman Sim Gim Guan said: “Our safeguards, including the casino entry levy, are primarily targeted at protecting locals from the potential harms of casino gambling.\n\n“Nonetheless, we recognise that problem gambling can affect foreign workers as well, which is why we have also extended other social safeguards and conduct public education to them.\n\n“For foreign workers, in particular work permit holders who tend to have lower wages, NCPG works with MOM, MWC, various companies employing foreign workers and dormitory operators to educate and encourage their foreign workers to apply for self-exclusion from gambling venues.”\n\nA Ministry of Manpower spokesperson said that the ministry’s Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group works closely with various stakeholders to educate migrant workers on prudent financial management practices and the risks of gambling.\n\n“This is done through channels such as the Settling-In Programme for migrant workers and regular engagement talks,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThrough the NCPG portal (www.ncpg.org.sg), one can apply for self-exclusion from gambling at casinos, jackpot machine rooms at private clubs and Singapore Pools online betting. Singaporeans and PRs can also apply for a voluntary visit limit to casinos.\n\nIndividuals or families who need help with gambling issues can call the NCPG Helpline at 1800-6-668-668 or use the Webchat service at www.ncpg.org.sg\n\n“After gambling at the casino, \nI wouldn’t have any money to take a taxi, so I would walk from Marina Bay all the way to Little India, where I would sleep at the MRT station.”\n\nMigrant worker Mani Arockiyasamy who racked up $10,000 in debt from casino gambling", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1d9a372a733ca3ca3adf5563f826bedd8a50b260ef6ece1b8539858e713c3bd1?w=825", "alt_text": "Foreign workers outside the casino at Resorts World Sentosa in November 2010."}]}

It hinted at a tense and suspenseful story of a man desperately searching for his missing wife. Apparently, the comparisons between the plot of both films resulted in Paramount Pictures (the distributor for Breakdown) to claim plagiarism. The issue caused Vidaamuyarchi to be postponed from its initial release date in January\n\n.\n\nThe plagiarism kerfuffle has not affected the film’s pre-release publicity.

His expansive career began with a supporting role in India’s first film talkie, Alam Ara (1931), and peaked when he took on the role of Emperor Akbar in the magnum opus\n\nMughal-E-Azam\n\n(1960).\n\nHis filmography boasts over 40 films and his footprint on India’s arts scene includes Prithvi Theatres, a theatre company he founded in 1944.\n\nPrithviraj went on to have three children, Raj, Shammi and Shashi, who each carved out a space for themselves in the annals of cinema history.\n\nRaj, often dubbed as the “Showman of Indian Cinema”, directed and starred in classics such as Awaara (1951) and Shree 420 (1955). He followed his father’s footsteps and created RK Films, and with that endeavour came a list of blockbusters including Sangam (1964) and Mere Naam Joker (1970).\n\nShammi broke away from the machismo often expected from actors of his time and took on energetic and bubbly portrayals of heroism in films such as Junglee (1961) and An Evening in Paris (1967).\n\nShashi, often regarded as the most reserved of the three brothers, was one of Bollywood’s most enduring stars and garnered international recognition through his work in Merchant Ivory films, such as Bombay Talkie (1970).\n\nRaj’s son Rishi carried the torch forward for his loverboy roles in films such as Bobby (1973),  which was directed by his father and went on to spark a new genre of teenage romance films.\n\nRishi went on to act in over 100 films spanning five decades.\n\nLeading the fourth generation of the family, Karisma – daughter of Rishi’s brother Randhir – was the first female member of the Kapoor clan to put her acting chops to the test.

His leadership in sustainability and economic resilience will guide the community forward, continuing a legacy of pluralism, progress and service to humanity.”\n\nThe Aga Khan’s funeral is expected to take place in Lisbon “in the coming days”, as soon as arrangements are finalised, the Imamat said on its website.\n\nThe Ismaili Muslim community in Singapore and other places in south-east Asia will congregate at each of the 12 centres for commemorative events.\n\nThe Aga Khan, known for his dazzling wealth and development work around the world, headed the world’s Ismaili community, a branch of Shi’ite Islam, which comprises around 15 million people around the world.\n\nA vast majority of the members hail from India and Pakistan, with Gujarat and Mumbai their main centres in India.\n\nThe Aga Khan – derived from Turkish and Persian words to mean commanding chief –  is believed by Ismailis to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammad.\n\nThe Aga Khan, who visited Singapore in 1983, 2008, 2009 and 2012 to meet leaders here, has been at the forefront of the The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), which was set up in 1967 to build schools and hospitals and provide electricity for millions of people in the poorest parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nThe AKDN’s contributions to Southeast Asia, in particular to Singapore and Malaysia, transcend religious or ethnic lines.\n\nThe longstanding relationship between the Ismailis and Singapore’s institutions and communities has been strengthened over the years through the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and Ismaili CIVIC.\n\nPrince Rahim Al-Hussaini was named the 50th leader of the Ismaili Muslims on Wednesday, after the will of his late father was unsealed, the AKDN said.\n\nBorn on Oct 12, 1971, the United States-educated, Swiss-based Rahim is the eldest son of the Aga Khan IV and his first wife, Princess Salimah nee Sarah Croker Poole, a British ex-model.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0aff1e3768d1ed9999882079a011d5bef6e955c12732bf2b9ca4d2678af9b7c7?w=825", "alt_text": "The Aga Khan being greeted by then-Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong in 2012."}]}

Every Feb 14, people around the world celebrate romance on Valentine’s Day in typical commercialised fashion.\n\nHistorians might argue over the occasion’s true origin – some say the inspiration for the holiday was a festival celebrating fertility, some cite the execution of a clergyman named Valentine, who was beheaded by a Roman Emperor for refusing to forsake his faith, thus making him a “saint” for his martyrdom.\n\nBut maybe in the age of 2025, the real contention is: Why are we still buying into the commercialisation of it all?\n\nThis cynicism is perhaps mostly demonstrated by Generation Z – or those born between 1995 and 2012.\n\nIn the dating app age, where relationships are largely by-products of happenstance right-swiping, Valentine’s Day no longer evokes a puppy-eyed disposition in many woke Gen Z-ers. Because really, is finding love even sexy anymore?\n\nFor many among the woke folks, Valentine’s Day is simply a fodder for the consumerist trap.\n\nFeb 14 has long been a marked spot on retail calendars. According to the US-based National Retail Federation, in 2024, shoppers spent a whopping US$25.8 billion on Valentine’s Day gifts, from jewellery to vacations. That makes V-Day the second most materialistic holiday after Christmas.\n\nAnother gripe youngsters have against the occasion is the focus it places on displays of affection – be it public or across social media. After all, love these days isn’t real if it isn’t highlighted on social media. To which, singles everywhere will lament: Must we be reminded that we’re miserable and alone in the middle of every February?\n\nNot surprisingly, a slew of anti-Valentine’s protests have popped up. For instance, anti- Valentine’s merchandise has flooded platforms like Etsy, where messages like “I can buy myself flowers” emblazoned on a red T-shirt are being sold for US$38.85. A “greeting” card with the tag “Happy consumerism-driven love day” starts at US$5.76.\n\nIronically, this new trend is also another way for retailers to fetch a profit. Sigh. Valentine’s Day remains profitable whether you are for or against it.\n\nIt’s about time the significance of Valentine’s Day is detached from the bells and whistles of gift-giving and lavish public displays of affection. The day, in essence – if we refer to the Roman clergyman’s intent –  is meant as a celebration of love, perhaps not just between romantic partners but among friends and family too.\n\nThis latest generation has seemingly chosen to subvert consumerist practices and redefine what days like Valentine’s Day mean. If Saint Valentine was still around, he’d buy one of those T-shirts on Etsy.\n\nReema Dudekula", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e75b383d71103fdb9ab63b31c3f0a214898e6a8e4464e762f2cc2f84db35b6d8?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Although the 24-year-old didn’t cross 29 in the next three innings, he lit up the stage in the fifth and final T20I. The young opener from Amritsar in Punjab smashed seven fours and 13 sixes during that record innings, thus setting the base for India’s 150-run victory.\n\nAustralia’s Travis Head leads the T20I batting charts, while England’s Phil Salt and India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav round off the top five batters in the rankings.\n\nAn aggressive batter just like his mentor Yuvraj Singh, Abhishek first raced to a 50 (after 17 balls) before reaching three figures in 37 balls, becoming the second-fastest Indian to a T20I hundred. Rohit Sharma had hit a 35-ball T20I century for India against Sri Lanka in 2017.\n\nAbhishek’s 135 is the highest individual score by an Indian in a T20I, surpassing Shubman Gill’s 126 not out against New Zealand in 2023. The left-hander’s 13 sixes are the most by an Indian in a T20I, surpassing Rohit Sharma’s 10 against Sri Lanka in 2017.\n\nHitting against bowlers clocking 140kmh to 150kmh, requires a lot of courage and Abhishek was spot on with his shot selection on his day, reported The Hindustan Times.\n\nEngland captain Jos Buttler lavished high praise on Abhishek after his spellbinding innings: “Yeah, we are obviously disappointed with the result, they (India) played a fantastic batting innings. I think credit to Abhishek Sharma, I thought that’s as clean a ball striking as I’ve seen, I thought he played fantastically well.”\n\nIndia’s coach Gautam Gambhir was stunned by Abhishek’s hitting. “I haven’t seen a better T20 hundred against bowlers who are bowling at 140-150kmh consistently,” said Gambhir, a former left-handed India opener.\n\nEngland coach Brendon McCullum doffed his hat to Abhishek and labelled his knock as one of the best he has seen in the format.\n\nMcCullum, considered a T20 legend himself, compared Abhishek to other legendary performers of the format for his brutal hitting display. “We’ve seen so many players over the years in this format that have been able to do it – Chris Gayle, Aaron Finch, AB de Villiers – and maybe Abishek Sharma is putting his hand up as one of those players,” said McCullum.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/122643973e686b4303f1968c3fdc2e739f5767147d789154795e335924192432?w=825", "alt_text": "India’s Abhishek Sharma."}]}

They were among the first batch to be deported under the Trump administration’s intensified stance on illegal immigration.\n\nThe passengers, including 19 women and 13 children, had endured a long and difficult journey, only to be shackled throughout their flight until arriving in India, reported the Times of India.\n\nAmong the deportees was 36-year-old Jaspal Singh from Hardorwal village in Punjab, who told the Press Trust of India that he was handcuffed and had his legs chained during the entire journey back.\n\nHe added that, initially, he had no idea he was being sent back to India. “We thought we were being taken to another camp, then a police officer told us we were going to India,” he said.\n\nMr Jaspal, like many others on the flight, had been deceived by a travel agent who promised him legal entry into the US. “I had asked the agent to send me with a proper visa, but he deceived me. The deal was finalised for Rs30 lakh ($46,000),” he explained.\n\nHis journey began in Brazil, where he was forced to cross the border into the US illegally after being stranded there for six months. He was arrested by the US Border Patrol on Jan 24 and held in custody for 11 days before being deported.\n\nMr Jaspal reflected on the emotional toll the deportation took on him. “A huge sum was spent, and money was borrowed. It’s all gone now,” he said, his voice heavy with disappointment.\n\nThe hardships faced by the deportees were not limited to their detainment in the US. Many had undertaken perilous journeys across several countries, often relying on dangerous and illegal routes to enter the US, reported the Times of India.\n\nMr Harwinder Singh, another deportee from Hoshiarpur, recounted his ordeal of travelling across Qatar, Brazil, Peru, and several other countries before reaching Mexico. From there, he joined a group of immigrants attempting to cross into the US.\n\n“We crossed hills. A boat, which was carrying us, almost capsized in the sea. We survived, but I saw one person die in the Panama jungle and another drowned in the sea,” Mr Harwinder said.\n\nHe spent Rs42 lakh on his journey, only to be caught by the US Border Patrol.\n\nThe deportations are part of the Trump administration’s broader strategy to clamp down on illegal immigration, which includes the controversial use of military aircraft for transporting deported migrants.\n\nCritics, including members of India’s Congress Party, have expressed outrage over the images of Indians being handcuffed and shackled during deportation. \r\rIndia’s two houses of parliament were adjourned within minutes of convening for the day as the Opposition demanded a discussion on the “deeply distressing and humiliating” manner of deportation.\n\nCongress MP Shashi Tharoor said Indians have been deported before too, but never in the manner immigrants were transported from US to India. “This is never a manner that Indians were deported. Handcuffing of our people is an insult,” he said.\n\nIndia’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to discuss the deportation issue.

Praggnanandhaa left 2024 behind with a tinge of disappointment. But he started the new year with a bang, toppling newly crowned world champion and compatriot Gukesh Dommaraju in tie-breakers to claim his maiden Tata Steel Chess title in Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands, on Sunday.\n\nHe became only the second Indian to win the prestigious event, after Viswanathan Anand, reported the Times of India.\n\nAfter finishing runner-up in the 2023 World Cup, the 19-year-old’s form took a hit in 2024.\n\nPragg finished fifth at the Candidates Tournament, and though he was part of India’s gold-winning team at the Budapest Chess Olympiad, his loss to the United States’ Wesley So in the penultimate round ended India’s unbeaten run in the Open section.\n\n“It feels really good because I didn’t have a great end to 2024. I was highly motivated for this event and worked hard with my coach,” said Praggnanandhaa, after receiving a warm welcome from Tamil Nadu sports officials at the Chennai Airport on Tuesday.\n\nPraggnanandhaa’s victory at the Tata Steel Chess tournament was shaped by a mix of his brilliance and “lucky” contributions from his Olympiad gold-winning teammates.\n\nIndia No. 2 Arjun Erigaisi’s win over Gukesh in the final round pushed the latter into tie-breaks, while Pentala Harikrishna’s draw with Nodirbek Abdusattorov kept the Uzbek grandmaster out of the playoffs, reported India Today.\n\nPraggnanandhaa said the performances of his teammates over the past year inspired him in his run to the crown.\n\n“The results of other Indian chess players, like Gukesh winning the World Championship and Arjun Erigaisi crossing 2800 (Elo rating in classical chess), have definitely inspired me to work harder and keep going,” said the Chennai boy.\n\nWinning the prestigious tournament, Praggnanandhaa earned 25 circuit points, placing him second on the 2025 FIDE circuit leaderboard – an important step towards qualifying for the Candidates Tournament next year.\n\nThe player said that, while the win was significant, there’s still a long road ahead.\n\n“It’s still the start of the year. Many huge tournaments are coming up in 2025, like the World Cup and Grand Swiss, and all these are very important for Candidates qualification,” said Praggnanandhaa, who will next compete at the Prague Masters from Feb 25 to March 7.\n\n“Still, this win is important for my confidence because I wasn’t happy with my games in the last few months, whereas I was satisfied with all the games I played at Tata Steel Chess.\n\n“At the end of the day, the title came to our city, so that’s a proud feeling. It was nice to have two Chennai boys in the final. Huge congratulations to him (Gukesh) as well; he played really well.”\n\nThe result was a huge disappointment to Gukesh as the India No. 1 as at one point he had the sole lead in the tournament. But a dip in performances towards the end saw Praggnanandhaa catch up, and then the results on Round 13 forced a tie-breaker.\n\nGukesh was clearly devastated, and those emotions were totally visible on his face, reported India Today. He fell back on his seat and looked up at the ceiling, leaving even Praggnanandhaa stunned.\n\nCalling it the “Indian chess winter at Wijk,” Anand lauded Praggnanandhaa for showing the courage to bounce back after two consecutive losses on the final day.\n\n“Congratulations to @rpraggnachess on winning his first @tatasteelchess event in Wijk aan Zee. The last day was not typical at all of his play. He played many brilliant games, but yesterday he got outplayed, then tenaciously defended a lost position,” said Anand.\n\n“The tragedy for him was after getting close to the desired goal of a draw, he blundered again. @DGukesh had lost a while ago to Arjun, so we were in the unusual situation of both title contenders losing their games and going to the tiebreak.”\n\nAnand also lauded Gukesh’s hunger, saying the world champion’s run to the final step of the podium at Tata Steel Chess shows he is not ready to settle for anything less than titles on the tour.\n\n“Gukesh also ended his tournament with a loss which was not representative of his play in the event, and for the second year in a row, he lost the tiebreak,” said the Indian legend. “Nonetheless, this performance, right after winning the world title, confirms he is as hungry as ever.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/25db48fe9314d0483bf8df16c4a83c499c0a14f76481b1106e90329b711f47cc?w=825", "alt_text": "After his loss to compatriot R.

Gopalakrishnan, former executive director of Tata Sons, to promote the book Jamsetji Tata, co-authored with Mr Harish Bhat, the brand custodian at Tata Sons.\n\nTwelve entries from around the world were received, and Dr Flocy’s deeply personal and insightful reflections won the final award.\n\nAn Indian citizen from Kochi, Dr Flocy has lived in Singapore for 13 years. At SMU, she oversees executive development programmes for corporate leaders, family businesses and government officials.\n\nA champion of steward leadership, she frequently shares Tata Group case studies in her courses, showcasing their values and ethical business practices.\n\nHer admiration for Tata’s influence began a decade ago when a Mumbai taxi driver enthusiastically spoke about the Indian conglomerate’s positive impact on workers. This interaction left a lasting impression on her.\n\nShe also recalls her visit to Jamshedpur, where she witnessed Tata’s early adoption of robotic street cleaners – a testament to the company’s visionary approach to technology. Mr Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group, established the city of Jamshedpur in 1907, laying the foundation for Asia’s first steel plant there, and subsequently it became the heart of the Tata Group’s industrial endeavours.\n\nMs Flocy fondly remembers seeing Mr Ratan Tata, the chairman of Tata Group and Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and an honorary Singapore citizen, in Mumbai while driving to work.\n\nAt a traffic signal, she was surprised to find him sitting in the front seat of a car, engaged in a meaningful conversation with his driver – a rare sight in Indian corporate culture, where most business leaders prefer the backseat.\n\nLiving near the luxury apartments Taj Wellington Mews, she also often saw Mr Ratan Tata walking his beloved dogs, enjoying his private moments.\n\nShe later attended his 2014 visit to SMU, where he received an honorary doctorate. His humility and powerful vision for India and Tata’s future left a deep impact on her.\n\nDr Flocy highlights Tata’s ethical business practices, particularly their anti-corruption stance in India’s challenging environment. She has worked with several Tata leaders and admires their commitment to integrity and corporate social responsibility.\n\nShe recalls Tata’s response to the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, where the company provided financial support to victims – employees and non-employees alike. Similarly, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Tata opened its five-star Taj Hotels to healthcare workers, offering free accommodation.\n\nThe 2016 leadership crisis at Tata Sons, which led to the controversial ousting of Mr Cyrus Mistry, was another defining moment for Tata’s legacy. Ms Flocy, like many academics, followed the developments closely and prayed that Tata would endure the storm while preserving the company’s values.\n\nDr Flocy submitted her heartfelt article to Mr Gopalakrishnan without expecting a prize. She was pleasantly surprised when, six weeks later, she was announced the winner, and the recipient of a signed copy of the Jamsetji Tata book.\n\nMr Gopalakrishnan praised her touching and humane narrative, calling it an example of values that the world desperately needs.\n\nMr K.V. Rao, former resident director (ASEAN) at Tata Group, also commended Ms Flocy, noting that she deeply understands the Tata ethos and has authentically shared its best practices with the world.\n\nFor Dr Flocy, winning was not about competition but about documenting her personal memories of Tata’s impact. She takes pride in sharing Tata’s legacy of integrity, leadership and service with her students and global business leaders.\n\n“As an Indian, Tata’s values are etched in my heart,” she said. “I hope other Indian businesses will follow their clean, ethical leadership model. Through my work, I’m grateful to showcase the power of the Tata brand to the world.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8c07d2247e20c502c25129969948b483700f40cd6300b79114cad4d3666d0638?w=825", "alt_text": "Dr Flocy Joseph with a book on Ratan Tata."}]}

Even Alia Bhatt’s attempt at an action-heroine role fell flat.\n\nYet, amid the film’s shortcomings, one actor’s performance stood out – Vivek Gomber as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Hansraj Landa, a ruthless prison officer.\n\nHis portrayal, reminiscent of iconic antagonists like Heath Ledger’s Joker, captivated audiences. His mastery of the Singlish-inflected Singaporean accent left viewers wondering – how did an Indian actor from Rajasthan pull it off so convincingly?\n\nI got through to Vivek, 46, via filmmaker Rahul DaCunha. His answer came as a surprise: “I’m a Singapore citizen.”\n\nBorn in Jaipur, Vivek’s path to acting was shaped by his family’s move to Singapore in 1989. His father, a banker, sought better educational opportunities for him, while his mother, a high court judge in Rajasthan, remained in India.\n\nVivek completed his education at United World College and then served National Service (NS) in 2000. Initially struggling with his European-Indian accent, he quickly adapted, picking up local lingo and forging friendships.\n\nDuring NS, Vivek excelled as an instructor at the School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC), earning praise from his superiors.\n\nHis commanding officer, Senior Warrant Officer Lim Eng Teong, told The New Paper in July 1999 that Vivek was outstanding and was selected to undergo a further 11-week advanced section leader’s course.\n\n“He has been with me for about a year. He has no problem mixing with the local guys, and we have gone on overseas training. He is more than ready to serve and really puts in effort,” said SWO Lim.\n\nVivek told The New Paper the same year: “Singapore was just a place where I got my education. Now, after NS, it’s more than that. If I had to fight a war to defend Singapore, I would.”\n\nHis love for cinema grew through Bollywood films he watched with his father, a passion further nurtured by his parents’ support.\n\nHe later studied acting at Emerson College in Boston, graduating in 2004.\n\nAfter a brief stint teaching toddlers in Singapore, he moved to Mumbai, honing his craft at Prithvi Theatre.\n\nHe moved on to television soaps and minor roles in Bollywood films.\n\nVivek’s breakthrough came as both actor and producer in Court (2014), a multilingual legal drama. His portrayal of a Gujarati defence lawyer won him Best Actor at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, while Court itself secured Best Feature Film at India’s 62nd National Film Awards.\n\nHe continued to gain recognition through films like Sir, Netflix’s Bombay Begums, Mira Nair’s A Suitable Boy and Hansal Mehta’s Lootere.\n\nDespite his growing success, Vivek faced sacrifices, juggling his career between Singapore and India while caring for his father, who died in 2010.\n\nVivek’s Singaporean background proved invaluable in shaping his portrayal of OIC Hansraj in Jigra, earning him a nomination for Best Performance in a Negative Role at the 25th International Indian Film Academy Awards.\n\nHis ability to fully inhabit the character – mastering the accent, mannerisms, and speech patterns – came naturally.\n\nHe credits this skill to his exposure to diverse cultures in Singapore and later in Boston. “At UWC, I was surrounded by different accents. Mimicking them became second nature,” he explained.\n\nFor Court, he perfected his Gujarati accent by spending time with Gujarati communities. Similarly, his inspiration for OIC Hansraj came from a Singaporean Tamil officer he encountered during NS. “The accent and dialogue delivery just came naturally when I thought of him,” he said.\n\nVivek believes second- and third-generation immigrants often feel the need to prove their loyalty by working harder than locals. He aimed to capture this complex dynamic in his performance.\n\nWhile Vivek is celebrated for his nuanced roles, he admits that balancing artistic integrity with commercial success is challenging. “I’ve always been drawn to meaningful, progressive cinema. But I also understand the need for films to reach a broader audience,” he said.\n\nHis acting idols – Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Robin Williams – have shaped his approach to choosing roles. “I admire actors who can completely disappear into their characters. That’s what I strive for,” he shared.\n\nBeyond acting, Vivek has made his mark as a producer. He co-produced Sir, a film about class divides in India, which won acclaim at Cannes. “Producing is a different beast. It’s about finding stories that need to be told and making sure they reach the right audience,” he explained.\n\nHis production company, Zoo Entertainment, focuses on films that challenge societal norms. “We want to tell stories that resonate, that make people think,” he added.\n\nDespite his global career, Vivek returns to Singapore yearly to visit friends and his goddaughter. “Of course I miss Singapore! I might be there in May this year,” he said.\n\nWhile he now stays with friends, his childhood home was in Meyer Road, Katong. “That makes me an East Coaster for sure!” he said with a laugh, recalling fond memories of waterfront walks at East Coast Park.\n\nHis favourite local foods? “Everything, dude!” he exclaimed, listing bee hoon, black pepper crab, wanton mee and chicken rice. His go-to spots include Five Star Chicken Rice and Sin Ho Sai on East Coast Road.\n\nSingapore remains deeply ingrained in him. “It gave me so much – discipline through NS, cultural exposure, and a global perspective,” he said. “At the end of the day, Singapore is home, and I am Singaporean.”\n\nWith Jigra reaffirming his acting prowess, what’s next for Vivek? “I want to explore roles that challenge me. Maybe an international project, maybe something completely unexpected,” he said.\n\nHis dream is to work with directors like Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve. “I love how they create immersive, thought-provoking cinema. Being part of that would be incredible,” he shared.\n\nDespite his achievements, Vivek remains humble. “It’s been a long journey, but I feel like I’m just getting started.”\n\nActor Vivek Gomber\n\nVivek Gomber at his graduation from the Singapore Army’s advanced section leaders’ course in 1998.\n\nVivek with Shahana Goswami in Bombay Begums.\n\n“Singapore gave me so much – discipline through NS, cultural exposure, and a global perspective.

Every time I tried to bring life into this world, I faced another hurdle,” she recalled.\n\nShe turned to In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), a process that involves retrieving mature eggs from the ovaries and fertilising them with sperm in a laboratory.\n\nThe fertilised embryos are then transferred to the uterus, where they develop into a pregnancy.\n\nMrs Hermann’s hopes turned to despair when the doctor told her that IVF was unlikely to succeed as she had diabetes.\n\n“I lost hope,” said Mrs Hermann, 44.\n\nThe couple decided to let nature take its course and turned to travelling instead.\n\nIn 2019 they visited another doctor, suggested by a relative, who saw possibilities in pregnancy.\n\nThe new specialist suggested IVF to stimulate Mrs Hermann’s egg production and a regimen of medications for Mr Singh, 42, to improve his sperm count.\n\nThe months that followed were a whirlwind of injections, tests, and prayers.\n\nManaging her diabetes became a critical part of the process as Mrs Hermann embraced a stricter diet and lifestyle.\n\nIVF proved to be a success and the couple now have a five-year-old son, Ayden Ishaan Singh.\n\n“After carrying our son, we felt every setback was worth it,” said Mrs Hermann.\n\n“We want couples to know that even when the odds seem stacked against you, there’s still hope. We also urge other couples to read up more on the government subsidies provided for IVF.”\n\nSingapore’s fertility journey is one of contrasts – deeply rooted traditions and a society that embraces modern medicine yet grapples with the stigma surrounding infertility.\n\nWith the nation’s birth rate hitting record lows, IVF isn’t just a personal choice – it’s a matter of national interest sparking conversations about policies, accessibility and the emotional toll involved.\n\nAccording to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), the number of IVF cases increased more than 40 per cent between 2014 and 2023.\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah said that the Chinese Year of the Dragon failed to lift Singapore’s total fertility rate, which remained low at 0.97 in 2024 – the same figure as in 2023.\n\n“The Dragon Year effect has been diminishing over the years, reflecting the generational shifts in attitudes and priorities among young couples,” she said in Parliament on Feb 28.\n\nAnother IVF success story involves Mrs Rafidah Jalil, 38, and her husband Mimrah Mahmood, 40.\n\nIn five years, Mrs Rafidah underwent five cycles of IVF.\n\n“Anxiety, self doubts on whether I had enough eggs and frequent visits to the hospitals were some factors which contributed to the stress I had during my IVF journey,” she said.\n\nBut it was all worth it in the end. The couple now have three children, including a pair of twins.\n\nSaid Mr Mimrah: “It’s best for couples to go for medical screenings once they are married, even if they do not want to have children soon after marriage. IVF may not be the best solution for all couples, hence they can try other treatment options when problems are detected earlier.”\n\nAssociate Professor Saumya Jamuar, senior consultant, Genetics Service, at KKH, said: “KKH has introduced an enhanced genetic screening plan where married couples can be screened for more than 80 genetic disorders. This will aid couples in planning pregnancy based on the test results and whether they would want to explore treatment options.”\n\nMrs Angelene Hermann with her husband Melvinder Singh and son Ayden.\n\nPhoto: Angelene Hermann\n\n“KKH has introduced an enhanced genetic screening plan where married couples can be screened for more than 80 genetic disorders.

Believing she would not survive, he left her unconscious in a locked room. However, Ms Anshika miraculously regained consciousness and fled to her parents’ home, where she later reported the crime.\n\nMs Anshika’s police report reveals a disturbing history of coercion and abuse.\n\nShe alleges that her relationship with the policeman began under duress four years ago when he raped her. To escape legal consequences, he agreed to marry her in a temple. Initially, he kept her at his sister’s residence, making no public acknowledgment of their marriage.\n\nThe situation worsened after Mr Anuj secured a job with the Uttar Pradesh Police. With his newfound position, he allegedly began rejecting their marriage, denying Ms Anshika her rightful place in his life.\n\nFaced with his continued neglect and abuse, Ms Anshika sought legal intervention, filing a police report against him.\n\nA compromise was eventually reached, and Ms Anshika was moved into Mr Anuj’s home.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMeera Balasubramanian, who recently represented Singapore at the Asean performing arts festival in Cambodia, is set to present a dance-theatre production here that narrates the extraordinary life of Draupadi, the fierce heroine of the Indian epic Mahabharata.\n\nThe dancer-actor, who is committed to showcasing Indian cultural heritage on international platforms, performed a bharatanatyam item at November’s One Cultural Garden event in Cambodia which was organised by the Royal University of Fine Arts.\n\nShe also did a presentation on the topic “Preservation and Promotion of Classical/Folklore Dance in Singapore”.\n\n“I believe art is an incredibly powerful medium that forges deep connections between people, and that is why I wanted to do a show on Draupadi, who remains deeply relevant in today’s world,” said Meera, 40, who runs the Kalpavriksha Fine Arts academy in Singapore.\n\n“She is an interesting personality because her identity goes beyond being married to five men. She embodied the themes of justice, dignity, sacrifice and inner power, which remain deeply relevant in today’s world.\n\n“The production highlights her as a symbol of unwavering courage in the face of adversity, challenging societal norms and standing as a beacon of inspiration for all.”\n\nDraupadi, noted for her beauty and courage, is the wife of the five Pandava brothers, who are among the centrals characters in Mahabharata. Meera’s dance-drama Yajnaseni – The Eternal Flame, which will be staged at the School of the Arts (SOTA) on Feb 14 at 8pm in Tamil and Feb 15 at 8pm in English, focuses on the twists and turns in her action-filled journey.\n\nThrough the elegance of bharatanatyam, it traces her fiery birth, the swayamvara (ancient marriage ceremony) that alters her fate and the devastating humiliation that sparks a great war.\n\nIt also looks at her unwavering commitment to dharma (behaviour that is in harmony with the “order and custom” that sustains life) which transforms her into a symbol of resilience and divinity, culminating in a profound connection to the present generation, where her story continues to inspire strength and justice.\n\nMeera, who plays the main protagonist and dance lead, conceptualised the show, She also directed it and did a part of the choreography.\n\n“When I chanced upon books on Draupadi, it got me thinking, and I had the urge to present it in a dance-drama format,” she said. “Draupadi’s birth, life, everything was for a cause; for a greater good. This makes her divine, yet she succumbed to human emotions and conflicts, and she overcame all the trials and tribulations in her life through grace and power.”\n\nSix young Singaporean dancers, who represent the voice of today’s women, join Meera on stage as the ensemble. Music is by O.S. Arun and Eswar Ramakrishnan, and choreography by senior dancer Hari Padman.\n\nMeera was aided by scholar Sudha Seshayyan and kathakali (a dance form) expert Sadnam Balakrishnan on research and lyrics for some compositions.\n\nThe appearance at Asean in One Cultural Garden in Cambodia has come as a timely booster for Meera. The event fostered awareness and appreciation of Asean’s Intangible Cultural Heritage with a particular focus on traditional dance. It brought together artistes from all 10 Asean countries to discuss, create and perform.\n\nMeera, who represented Singapore at last year’s Sarong Diplomacy cultural event in Kuala Lumpur, was selected by the National Heritage Board to be Singapore’s cultural ambassador because of her deep connection to the arts scene here. As a performing artiste and an active contributor to Singapore’s rich cultural tapestry,  she has been involved in engaging communities in traditional arts to promote harmony and cultural understanding.\n\n“My presentation emphasised the significance Singapore places on culture and tradition as a means of uniting communities,” she said. “It also highlighted the support provided for the preservation and promotion of classical arts in the country.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/077f6b07e4793b3b7d2c415dd07e90167c914c382828627257fb566793cfc4e3?w=825", "alt_text": "Dancer-actor Meera Balasubramanian in Yajnaseni – The Eternal Flame."}]}

Raised in the United States, he received his initial training from his mother Shubha Narayan, and later travelled to Chennai at 11 to train under the legendary Carnatic vocalist K.S. Krishnamurthy.\n\nAfter his guru’s passing, Sandeep continued his studies under celebrated Carnatic vocalist Sanjay Subrahmanyan. After completing his bachelor’s degree in California, he made a bold decision to move permanently to Chennai in 2002 and pursue music full-time.\n\nOver the years, Sandeep noticed a decline in young audiences at Carnatic concerts, especially during Margazhi season, the Tamil month known for classical performances. “The number of young listeners has dwindled significantly,” he laments.\n\nDetermined to make Carnatic music more accessible and engaging, Sandeep is working on initiatives to introduce traditional music to school children.\n\n“Early exposure fosters deeper appreciation,” he says, hinting at plans to integrate Carnatic music into school curriculums.\n\nBeyond formal education, Sandeep is leveraging social media to reach wider audiences. Through Instagram and YouTube, he shares performances and interactive content, blending tradition with modern engagement strategies.\n\nMarried to bharatanatyam dancer Radhe Jaggi, daughter of Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, Sandeep has a unique perspective on how technology is shaping traditional arts.\n\n“Social media has changed how we consume music, but it has also created new opportunities for artistes to connect with audiences,” he explains.\n\nHe acknowledges trends like “hook music” and short-form content, recognising that adapting to digital platforms is necessary for long-term impact.\n\nDespite the rise of AI-generated music, Sandeep remains confident in the irreplaceable human essence of creativity and emotion.\n\n“AI can mimic sound, but the depth of human expression is beyond its reach,” he says. “In fact, AI will push artistes to enhance their creativity.”\n\nSingapore audiences will get a chance to witness Sandeep’s soul-stirring performance on March 29 at PGP Hall, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple.\n\nOrganised by the Hindu Endowments Board, the concert aims to immerse attendees in the rich traditions of Carnatic music.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2abbe3472686ff4cc9a3508dad4c9920c655701c492d43fd11657a5d294478e5?w=825", "alt_text": "Sandeep Narayan (centre) during a music performance."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIndia’s Ports, Shipping and Waterways Minister Sarbananda Sonowal called his three-day visit to Singapore “a great learning experience”, as India and Singapore signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor (GDSC) on March 25.\n\nThe agreement aims to accelerate maritime digitalisation and decarbonisation while strengthening the long-standing maritime relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe Singapore-India GDSC will facilitate the adoption of zero or near-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission technologies and promote digital solutions in maritime operations.\n\nThe initiative aligns with India’s vision of sustainable and technology-driven port development, which has been a key focus under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership.\n\nThe signing was witnessed by Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and Environment Amy Khor and Mr Sonowal during the Singapore Maritime Week 2025, which was held from March 24 to 28.\n\nSince its launch in 2022, the GDSC initiative has expanded to over 28 stakeholders across maritime, energy and finance sectors.\n\nSingapore, as a key transshipment and bunkering hub, and India, a leader in green fuel production and IT innovation, will work together to establish best practices for decarbonisation and digital innovation in shipping.\n\nSpeaking at the signing ceremony, Mr Sonowal highlighted that “India’s strength in IT and green fuel production, combined with Singapore’s role as a global maritime hub, will set new benchmarks for sustainability and efficiency in the sector.”\n\nThe LoI paves the way for both nations to identify key stakeholders, initiate pilot projects and eventually formalise a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the full implementation of the GDSC.\n\nDuring the Singapore visit, Mr Sonowal inaugurated the India Pavilion at the Singapore Maritime Week.\n\nThe pavilion showcased India’s efforts in modernising ports, decarbonising shipping and driving maritime digital innovation.\n\nAt the India Business Roundtable, Mr Sonowal emphasised India’s growing influence as a maritime hub, fuelled by sustainability, innovation and strategic partnerships.\n\nHe invited global investors to participate in India’s transformation of ports into clean energy-driven investment hubs and its push for shipbuilding excellence.\n\nThe minister outlined India’s ambitious maritime modernisation plan, including making India a top-five global shipbuilding nation by 2047.\n\nMr Sonowal also met several Singaporean leaders, including Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.\n\nThe discussions covered strengthening maritime and supply chain connectivity, developing sustainable shipping routes, expanding shipbuilding and repair collaboration and promoting investment in India’s logistics infrastructure.\n\nMr Balakrishnan emphasised the historic ties between India and Singapore in a Facebook post, stating: “For millennia, the sea has connected our two nations, carrying trade, culture and ideas. Today, our partnership remains vital as India’s maritime sector powers its rapid growth.”\n\n“India’s strength in IT and green fuel production, combined with Singapore’s role as a global maritime hub, will set new benchmarks for sustainability and efficiency in the sector.”\n\nIndia’s Ports, Shipping and Waterways Minister Sarbananda Sonowal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5164c4485b90f3c38cbfc00d395c2c8486fee2f052a70214916dca8df028fc1f?w=825", "alt_text": "India’s Ports, Shipping and Waterways Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan."}]}

Kavi\n\nReema Dudekula\n\nThe scene was set early, as partygoers started arriving at Siloso beach by 7pm in full spirits. Tents lined the beach, offering a place to cool off and regroup between rounds of dancing and colour play.\n\nAs the sun set, the energy intensified – everyone was covered in a rainbow of vibrant powders, their smiles as bright as their clothes.\n\nIt was impossible to discern who was wearing what, as each person had become a canvas of hues, from head to toe.\n\nThis is what I was greeted with at the first night-time Holi party I ever attended.\n\nCelebrated across India and beyond, Holi symbolises the triumph of righteousness, the arrival of spring, and the boundless power of love and unity.\n\nPeople of all ages eagerly participate in the fun, with friends, families and even strangers coming together to join in the vibrant festivities.\n\nTraditional dhol beats and lively music usually fill the air, while festive treats such as gujiya (a sweet pastry) and thandai (a spiced drink) are shared among revellers.\n\nIn Singapore, the celebration of Holi mirrors the exuberance of India. Every March, hundreds gather at parties across the island to throw coloured powders at one another and dance to Indian film songs, both old and new.\n\nFrom Sentosa to Sembawang, Holi events span across the weekends of March, creating a mood of exhilaration.\n\nYouth organisers have recently entered the market to pander specifically to young folk who have moved past the “Khaike paan bana raswala” (famous yesteryear Holi song) phase of holi parties.\n\nNeon Holi, hosted by Brown Roast Entertainment, took Holi from a traditional day-time event to night. The first ever night Holi they organised was in 2023, with more than a 1,000 attendees.\n\nThe third edition of the event was held on March 22 this year. A nine-hour party that concluded at 3am, the event saw a relentless crowd eager to party the night away.\n\nAs the drinks started flowing, the atmosphere loosened and so did everyone’s inhibitions.\n\nThe playlist was a vibrant mix of old and new, with classic Holi anthems like Rang Barse and Balam Pichkari blasting through the speakers, alongside the latest hits from Bollywood that make you want to sing along.\n\nBollywood songs at Holi parties are more than just background noise – they bridge the gap between strangers, who now have reason to link arms and dance together.\n\nThe magic peaked at around 10pm when celebrity musician Rashmeet Kaur took the stage, clad in red, drawing the crowd into a collective frenzy.\n\nAs she sang the chorus to one of her most loved tunes – Ishq Nachaawe – the crowd erupted in unison.\n\nCoinciding with the short-lived monsoon weekend Singapore experienced, it started pouring over the attendees as the clock struck midnight.\n\nBut, rather than dampening the mood, the rain dance only added to the euphoria of lights and colours.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/75ef327e10b8dfd986bf8e9e05e42fd1da6aff9f3d8558ec80a9c0c4c92da04a?w=825", "alt_text": "Revellers at the Neon Holi party."}]}

In his version, Mr Kamra referred to Madam Sitharaman as “sari wali didi” and “Nirmala tai”, mocking the government’s economic policies.\n\nThe lyrics criticised inflation, corporate tax structures and middle-class struggles, while taking a jab at the controversy surrounding GST on popcorn.\n\nMadam Sitharaman had previously justified differential GST rates on popcorn based on whether it contained sugar or spice. Mr Kamra’s parody hinted at this issue, satirising the finance minister’s explanations.\n\nMr Kamra’s legal troubles stem from a previous satirical song based on Bholi Si Surat from the film Dil To Pagal Hai, reported NDTV.\n\nWithout explicitly naming Mr Shinde, the comedian referenced gaddar (traitor), a term associated with Mr Shinde’s 2022 defection from Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nShiv Sena legislator Murji Patel filed a police report, leading to an FIR under Section 356(2) (defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita at Dombivli police station in Thane district.\n\nMumbai Police summoned Mr Kamra on Tuesday, but he requested a week’s time to appear. His request was denied, and a second summons was issued on Wednesday, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\nOn Sunday night, Shiv Sena workers stormed the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar, where Mr Kamra had performed. Videos showed them throwing chairs, damaging property and leaving documents scattered.\n\nInstead of retreating, Mr Kamra responded by posting another satirical clip. Using Hum Honge Kamyaab (We Shall Overcome), he changed the lyrics to Hum Honge Kangaal (We Will Be Bankrupt), overlaying the footage of the vandalism.\n\nHis video also featured Shiv Sena Yuva Sena General Secretary Rahool Kanal, who had told news agency ANI that the vandalism was just a trailer.\n\nPolice registered an FIR against 40 Sena workers for ransacking the venue. On Monday, they arrested 12 individuals, including Mr Kanal, but they were granted bail the same day.\n\nMr Shinde, speaking in the Maharashtra Legislative Council on Wednesday, dismissed the controversy. “You keep calling me gaddar, but soon you’ll have to shut the daar (door) of your party,” he said, referencing the Shiv Sena faction led by Mr Thackeray.\n\nChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis took a strong stance against Mr Kamra’s comments, stating in the Assembly that freedom of expression should not lead to defamation. “Action will be taken as per the law,” he asserted.\n\nHowever, Mr Shinde also distanced himself from the vandalism, calling it an emotional reaction from party workers. He suggested Mr Kamra’s act might be part of a larger conspiracy, questioning, “Who is behind him?”\n\nAmid the controversy, the Opposition questioned why the BJP reacted strongly to Mr Kamra’s parody song but remained silent on his past jabs at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) leader Ambadas Danve pointed out the inconsistency. “Kamra has directly criticised PM Modi in his shows, and the BJP never objected. But now, over a song that doesn’t even name Shinde, they are outraged. It seems the BJP is using Shinde as a front to target Kamra,” he remarked.\n\nDespite legal action and backlash, Mr Kamra remains defiant. After the vandalism, he declared on X: “I will not apologise,” taking aim at both political leaders and mobs angered by his jokes.\n\nWith police investigations ongoing and another summons issued, Mr Kamra’s legal troubles are far from over. However, his satirical takes continue to spark debates on freedom of expression and political sensitivities in India.\n\n“I will not apologise... I don’t fear this mob and I will not be hiding under my bed, waiting for this to die down.”\n\nStand-up comedian Mr Kunal Kamra", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/50cd2b52d657ef0ab6faf99cdc2cadef1d3631e390b3e90ce64deb3d566164de?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Eknath Shinde (left) and Mr Kunal Kamra."}]}

A decade from that miserable year, Prof Huntington’s thesis has not come true. That is because Mr Lee was not only an institution in himself – a man whose name was synonymous with that of the nation he had built – but was also wise enough to know that even the greatest leaders are born to perish one day but that the systems and structures which they build can outlast them.\n\nSingapore has outlasted Lee Kuan Yew. That is the greatest tribute that Singapore can pay to him.\n\nThe institutions that Mr Lee built include the civil service, the military, the foreign service and the intelligence services. These vital sinews of the state uphold the good life in Singapore, a life sustained by the rule of law within national borders and by Singapore’s deterrent ability to protect those borders from predators, be they states or terror groups.\n\nOf course, the good life is not equally good. But even to be old and poor in Singapore is not as terrible as it is in many other countries.\n\nThe system ensures that humans do not perish out of sight just because they cannot contribute to the national coffers any longer. They have contributed already – by being loyal citizens of this patch of land lying on the face of an anonymous and uncaring earth.\n\nAs for the other end of the economic spectrum, Singapore thrives because the talented best here thrive the most. True, the salaries commanded by bankers and other top-earning professionals in the private sector, who lay down a benchmark for salaries in the top echelons of the public sector, do appear astronomical to me.\n\nHowever, the important thing is that those earnings are not made at the expense of the overall system – as in countries where wealth is a badge of corruption and nepotism for which the rest of society pays – but in the interests of that overall system.\n\nThe wealthy, through the taxes which they pay, create wealth for the rest of society, wealth that is distributed through public works and targeted subsidies.\n\nThat is why the system survives, a system founded on the non-negotiable premises of non-corruptibility and efficiency laid down and enforced by Mr Lee.\n\nWhether it will continue to do so in the future depends on the ability of coming political leaders to fit his national vision into changing circumstances and not use circumstances to legitimate their departure from that vision. I am not speaking of the current leadership but of that which will succeed it in the years and decades to come.\n\nI have hope that the continuity of Mr Lee’s ideas will endure beyond the first decade of his departure. That is because Singaporeans are a largely pragmatic people. They understand, although they do not always say so, that Singapore is a vulnerable state.\n\nIts success attracts the ominous attention of larger and far-less successful countries. Hence, elite dissension in Singapore and the country’s consequent inability to deal with international discordance will cost Singaporeans dearly. When the international chips are down, the national chips become useless.\n\nI stayed overnight at Marina Bay Sands Hotel with my family last week. We spent the evening at the infinity pool, where my son swam as his mother and I watched him. Then all three of us had dinner, walked around a bit, and went to our room.\n\nAs the lights atop the iconic buildings of Shenton Way came on at dusk, I was amazed at the existential resilience of Singapore’s financial skyline. Now in my 41st year here, this was the first time that I had witnessed the skyline from anything but below. I thought: How beautiful, but will all this last?\n\nI do not see why it should not. Singapore will exist in an inhospitable world, but it will survive so long as it can attract the world’s best and brightest in the financial and scientific fields, so long as race and religion remain markers and do not become dividers on the road to national coherence, and so long as Singaporeans own Singapore and are not affiliated to foreign powers that seek to own their country.\n\nA tall order? Not at all.\n\nSingapore will survive Lee Kuan Yew – on his terms.\n\nSingapore will exist in an inhospitable world, but it will survive so long as it can attract the world’s best and brightest in the financial and scientific fields, so long as race and religion remain markers and do not become dividers on the road to national coherence, and so long as Singaporeans own Singapore and are not affiliated to foreign powers that seek to own their country.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/24b8cbd17d15ca09e18aef9901c0448988fae6d951173a963db708c95fabcae5?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Sundramoorthy had Singaporeans going football crazy.\n\nThose players had a passion for the game and their nation embedded deep inside heart and soul and, even though the sport didn’t pay the bills back then, a victory was their sweet reward time.\n\nSince then the Kallang Roar has given way to a cat’s mew and the unending search of the Lions searching for their pride.\n\nOn Mar 25, Singapore played out a goalless draw with Hong Kong in the third round of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, a relief for Team Singapore fans who had to hide their identity following a 0-1 home defeat to Nepal in their previous outing.\n\nThe Hong Kong clash was their first game in Group C, where they are slotted alongside India, Bangladesh and Hong Kong and have to play six home and away fixtures.\n\nPlaying at home, with the fans behind them and under experienced Japanese coach Tsutomu Ogura, was the best chance the Lions had of starting their campaign on a positive note. But it wasn’t to be.\n\nWhile senior players such as custodian Izwan Mahbud, defender Safuwan Baharudin and midfielder-skipper Haris Harun made their presence felt, the attack lacked bite, with that X factor missing through most part of the game.\n\nEven Ilhan Fandi and Faris Ramli coming off the bench in the 81st minute did nothing to contribute towards a home win.\n\nThe other Group C encounter between India and Bangladesh may have ended in a draw, but the road ahead to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia doesn’t get any easier for Singapore.\n\nTha Lions face Bangladesh on June 10, followed by a trip to India on Oct 9.\n\nCurrently ranked 185 in the world, Bangladesh are keen on etching their name on the world football map, like they did with cricket. They are hungry for success and extremely hard working.\n\nThey are also stronger when playing at home, with their 2-1 win over 162-ranked Maldives in November last year a testament to this.\n\nSingapore may be ranked 160, but a clash in Dhaka will be a challenge.\n\nThe Lions will have to draw inspiration from the last meeting between the sides in 2015, when they won 2-1 away.\n\nIndia remain the team to beat in Group C. The 126-ranked team are unbeaten in four out of their last five home games, including a 3-0 win over Maldives in March this year.\n\nThe team has also been strengthened by the return of ace striker Sunil Chhetri.\n\nThe 40-year-old came out of retirement to help his team qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup and, with 95 goals in 153 appearances, poses a huge threat to all the teams in Group C.\n\nSingapore hold the advantage over India on paper, having won two of their four encounters with another clash ending in a draw.\n\nOgura’s Lions can also take heart from their last match with India on Sept 24, 2022, which ended in a 1-1 draw.\n\nThe Lions last appearance in the Asian Cup finals stretches back to a little over three decades, when they hosted the event in 1984.\n\nNow, opportunity knocks on the door once again, with a team that has energetic young stars and experienced players.\n\nA 2-2 draw with China in the 2026 World Cup qualifier on March 21, 2024, showed that the Lions can stand their ground. They came back from two goals down to finish on a par with the East Asian giants.\n\nCan Singapore reach the next Asian Cup finals?\n\nI believe they can, but it will take guts, extreme hard work, discipline, self-belief, passion, patriotic pride and the undying support of the fans.\n\n“Compared to our last game, we were much better, but we missed two points. We showed we have improved with our football before we reach the penalty box, but we must improve more inside the box and score. We also need to provide the players better individual and group training in the national team. The responsibility is on me – if they continue to not score, that means my education is not good.”\n\nSingapore coach Tsutomu Ogura, after the draw with Hong Kong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0ceac7fd76c5acd17cf1e95d32e797eb41e4a4bd54aa59c48ca4c37829194ac8?w=825", "alt_text": "Singapore’s Akram Azman (in red) and Hong Kong’s Walter Soares Junior during the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier at the National Stadium on March 25."}]}

Kavi\n\nகி. ஜனார்த்தனன்\n\nAfter a four-year break due to Covid-19, Bencoolen Mosque has resumed preparing traditional Ramadan meals in-house with a brand-new kitchen – created from a pantry in the basement carpark.\n\nSeven chefs from Tamil Nadu have been flown in to prepare porridge and biryani for thousands of congregants throughout the fasting month.\n\nThe 200-year-old mosque, located in the heart of Singapore, had previously relied on external caterers since 2020. However, following a $4 million refurbishment, it has reopened with expanded prayer spaces, a youth corner and a dedicated kitchen.\n\nMosque president Mohamed Rafeeq Mohamed Yusoof highlighted the challenges of obtaining approvals from multiple agencies, including the Singapore Civil Defence Force and Building and Construction Authority.\n\n“The plan for the new kitchen took about three months to be approved. It was a tough, arduous process, but with immense financial and moral support from congregants, we are thrilled to serve them again this Ramadan,” he said.\n\nIt took six months to complete the refurbishment project.\n\nFor Muslims breaking their fast at sunset, the mosque is once again serving a comforting rice porridge, which is known as Nonbu Kanji in Tamil.\n\nIt is made by slowly cooking rice until it dissolves into a smooth texture, before adding spiced minced mutton (keema), lentils, cabbage and carrots. It is then garnished with coriander and coconut milk, enhancing its flavour and richness.\n\nThe dish, tracing its origins to Middle Eastern Harees, has evolved into a South Indian specialty.\n\nThroughout Ramadan, the mosque’s kitchen will prepare 58,000 portions of porridge and 17,000 biryani meals.\n\nHead chef Haja Alauddin, 42, who has been cooking since age 12, is leading the kitchen team. “Each day, we use 70kg of rice and 30kg of minced mutton to prepare the porridge,” he said. “Knowing the precise quantities of spices and the right sequence for adding ingredients comes with years of experience.”\n\nThe chefs, who hail from Muthuppettai village in Tamil Nadu’s Thanjavur district and are housed within the mosque, start work at 7am. They cook in massive 150-litre pots, ensuring meals are ready for both distribution and the evening iftar (break fast).\n\nMr Rafeeq personally prepares the specially-blended masala paste, a key ingredient for both the porridge and chicken dum biryani, which are served to 1,300 people daily.\n\nThe mosque’s revitalisation has brought back more than just meals – it has rekindled a sense of community.\n\nFull-time national serviceman Afeef Mohamed Rayyan, 22, expressed his joy at the return of in-house meal distribution. “This tradition draws people together, and the new youth corner encourages social, educational and religious discussions,” he said.\n\nBuilt between 1825 and 1828 by Indian-Muslim workers brought from India to Bengkulu, Indonesia, by the British, Bencoolen Mosque has long been a pillar of the Indian-Muslim community in Singapore.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/83c9567efaa1595725fb6af23f9e1ca1f7a8ddd0015869bc5ae64b32a63436ca?w=825", "alt_text": "Chefs preparing the Ramadan porridge using three massive pots."}]}

However, the outpouring of affection and respect she continues to receive speaks volumes about the depth of her influence.\n\nStudents, fellow runners and family members took to social media to express their sorrow, paying tribute to Ms Renuka’s life.\n\n“The sister I knew was everything that was good in the world that we need more of. She was kind, gentle and brilliant. She never showed off,” said Mr Devathas Satianathan, Ms Renuka’s brother, who took to Facebook to pen a heartfelt note in her memory.\n\nShe was a tour de force, representing Singapore in long-distance running at both the 2011 and 2015 SEA Games. She finished fifth in 10,000m event in 2011.\n\nHer commitment to the sport extended beyond competitions, as she was known for her graciousness and sportsmanship, often inspiring fellow athletes with her dedication.\n\nBeyond her athletic pursuits, Ms Renuka was deeply committed to education, teaching General Paper at Yishun Innova Junior College, and later at Eunoia Junior College.\n\nFormer students fondly recall her as a guiding force of intellect and warmth, noting her ability to challenge them to think critically. Her commitment to her students’ growth transcended the classroom, as she took an active role in pushing them to become holistic thinkers.\n\nMs Vethanayake Ramachandran was one such student who trained with Ms Renuka in track and field at Innova JC, now known as Yishun Innova JC. “Ms Renuka’s enduring legacy lies in her unique ability to blend rigorous discipline with pure joy in training sessions. Her gentle spirit, kindness and inspiring presence shaped not just my athletic journey but our character – teachings that continue to resonate long after our days on the track,” she said.\n\nMr Shukul Raaj Kumar, one of Ms Renuka’s former General Paper students from Innova JC, said: “Beneath her tough exterior was a compassionate heart that saw something greater in us, even when we didn’t see it in ourselves. She didn’t just teach General Paper at Innova JC; she shaped the way we thought, wrote and engaged with the world.”\n\nMr Muhammad Shah Feroz, a fellow national runner, described her as “bubbly, sweet and caring,” emphasising that there was “never a dull moment” in her presence. He expressed disbelief over her sudden departure, stating: “Gone too soon, but never forgotten. Rest well, my friend.” he said.\n\nMr Soh Rui Yong, another national long-distance runner, said that he ran the New York City Half Marathon in her memory last Sunday. Mr Soh said in a Facebook post on March 18 that, with a “heavy heart”, he is mourning the loss of “one of the best people and training partners I’ve met through running, Renuka”.\n\nMs Renuka’s palpable impact on those around her continues to live on through them.\n\nHer wake was held at Everton Park on March 14, and she was cremated at Mandai Crematorium two days later.

Indian classical musician Dr Ghanavenothan Retnam paid tribute, saying: “Her artistic legacy will endure eternally.”\n\nMrs Usharani’s journey in dance began at four years old, and by nine, she had already won a gold medal from the Mayor of Penang for her bharatanatyam performance.\n\nShe later graduated from Bhaskar’s Arts Academy in 1963, cementing her place in the world of Indian classical arts.\n\nHer influence stretched beyond her own performances. Since 1976, she taught bharatanatyam at community centres and local schools, where her students won multiple gold awards at annual Youth Festival competitions.\n\nMany of her students also performed at local theatres, temples, and major national events such as the National Day Parade, Chingay Festival and Tamil New Year celebrations.\n\nBeyond Tamil culture, Mrs Usharani was passionate about learning and performing in different languages.\n\nCelebrated musician Dr Bhagya Murthy recalled: “Though Tamil was her native language, she stood out for her eagerness to master and showcase dance in multiple languages. As a Kannada speaker, I was deeply moved by her dedication to performing Purandara Dasa’s musical compositions with such passion and elegance.”\n\nFor many students, Mrs Usharani was more than just a dance teacher – she was a mentor, guide and maternal figure. Former student Anuradha Parasuraman, 38, said: “She radiated compassion and maternal warmth. I was thrilled that my three-year-old daughter would learn from the same teacher who taught me at three.”\n\nShe fondly recalled their last meeting, just two days before Mrs Usharani’s passing, during a dance class.\n\n“When I debuted at sixteen, she captivated students like me with her meticulous attention to detail, from costumes to practice routines,” said Ms Anuradha. “More than just a teacher, she was a source of love and guidance.”\n\nIn 2024, Mrs Usharani was inducted into Singapore’s Indian Hall of Fame in recognition of her contributions to the arts. Her influence, teachings, and dedication to bharatanatyam will live on through her students and the cultural landscape she helped shape.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, N.

If she could describe herself in one word, it would be “morbid,” because she works as an embalmer by day and trains as a Team Singapore boxer by night.\n\nShe has represented Singapore in more than 20 amateur-level fights on the international stage.\n\nIn 2023, she made history by becoming the first Singaporean boxer since 1976, regardless of gender, to qualify for the Asian Games.\n\nHer Asiad debut in China ended in a last-16 exit, but being the first Singaporean female boxer to compete in the Asian Games was a remarkable feat in itself.\n\nTo support herself financially, Danisha works as an embalmer, preserving and preparing bodies for funerals at not one, but three different funeral homes.\n\nAnd to fully dedicate herself to boxing, she broke a four-year bond of around $130,000 with a local hospital, where she was due to start work as a radiographer last year.\n\nDealing with dead bodies almost on a daily basis has given her a sharp perspective on life.\n\n“My colleague recently embalmed a 19-year-old boy who died of colon cancer and it struck me that life is unpredictable and that you have to seize every opportunity and go for it, even if you are not ready,” she said.\n\nInterestingly, her parents are more comfortable with her being an embalmer than a boxer.\n\nWhile they do worry about her ability to repay the bond fee on an embalmer’s salary, they have no objections to the grim nature of the work.\n\nAs a child, Danisha’s mother, a nurse at the Singapore National Eye Centre, would often pass by the mortuary on the way to work and tell the young Danisha about it.\n\n“I found it really interesting and kept wanting to know what happens inside a mortuary,” she said.\n\nAfter completing her diploma in biomedical science at Temasek Polytechnic – a course she studied because her parents wanted her to become a doctor – she took a gap year and worked as a Forensic Technical Officer at the Health Sciences Authority’s mortuary.\n\nDanisha assisted the pathologist with autopsies, which involved the dissection of organs and tissues, as well as radiography to scan the deceased and help determine the cause of death.\n\n“I truly enjoyed my work, so I stayed for three years. I left when I started my degree in diagnostic radiography at the Singapore Institute of Technology,” she said.\n\nShe now rotates between three funeral homes working from 11am to 5pm, except when there are no cases. Each case typically takes her an hour, allowing her to prepare up to six bodies in a workday. She has embalmed over 500 bodies to date.\n\nWhen asked how she feels about handling dead bodies, she said: “I don’t get emotionally attached since I don’t know them. But there was one case – an Indian boy had shot himself. When I released his body to the parents and they started playing Hindu devotional songs, it was one of the few times I got emotional.”\n\nOtherwise, Danisha considers herself a logical and practical person and prefers not to dwell on issues. This hard-headed approach helped her pursue boxing without her parents’ knowledge.\n\nShe turned to boxing at 17 to get over her disappointment of being only a reserve player in her polytechnic netball team. She had wanted to try out a contact sport and settled on boxing, as opposed to rugby or muay thai, because it uses mostly the upper body.\n\nShe googled “boxing gyms” and chose the first one that came up – Legends Fight Sport. However, because she was under 18, she needed her parents’ consent to sign up. After a lot of convincing, her mother finally agreed but on one condition: no physical contact.\n\n“Don’t hit anybody and nobody should hit you. You can only hit the punching bag,” her mother insisted.\n\nThe tenacious teen travelled to Clarke Quay almost daily for her hourly boxing training starting at 6.30am, before heading to Temasek Polytechnic for a full day of classes.\n\nAfter a year, her coach encouraged her to compete in local tournaments and she began winning matches, but kept it a secret from her parents, knowing they would disapprove.\n\nEach time Danisha won a boxing competition, like the one organised by SAFRA Tampines in 2015, she would wait until her family was sound asleep before sneaking home, clutching her trophy which she would duly hide under a pile of clothes in her cupboard.\n\nThis went on for four years.\n\nDanisha’s secret victories mirrored scenes from the Tamil blockbuster Ghilli, where actor Vijay plays an aspiring kabaddi player who defies his disapproving father and sneaks home after matches.\n\nWhen asked if Ghilli had inspired her, Danisha chuckled and replied: “Yes! I love that movie, but unfortunately, I can’t enter my house from the rooftop like Vijay’s character does.”\n\nIn 2017, she was selected for the national team, and two years later represented Singapore at the 30th SEA Games in the Philippines.\n\nThat same year, her hidden trophies came to light when her parents discovered her boxing pursuits on social media sparked by media coverage of her SEA Games debut.\n\nThey were not upset with her but expressed worry about her physical safety.\n\nHer mother remarked lightheartedly: “What if you get hit in the face? Who’s going to marry you after that?”\n\nFortunately, Danisha had only one serious injury in 11 years of boxing, when she fractured her left foot and tore a ligament after a sudden sharp movement during the 2023 Queen of the Ring competition in Australia. Despite the injury, she managed to win.\n\nThese days, Danisha no longer has to sneak home and can proudly display her medals and trophies.\n\nShe has even won over her parents – her mother prepares special meals for her in keeping with her diet plan.\n\nHer father watches her bouts if they are streamed online sometimes, but not her mother. “She can’t bear to see her child get hurt,” said Danisha.\n\nDanisha became the first Singaporean to win a medal at the World Boxing Cup when she won a silver medal in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia last year.\n\nShe is currently the national champion in the women’s 48kg category and will attend a training camp in Japan to boost her chances of qualifying for December’s SEA Games in Thailand.\n\nDanisha’s coach, three-time SEA Games bronze medallist Muhamad Ridhwan, confirmed that their goal for 2025 is to refine her technical skills, enhance her strategic approach and ensure she is in peak condition to compete at the highest level.\n\n“Balancing a demanding profession as an embalmer while training as a national boxer is no easy feat, but she approaches both with remarkable discipline and resilience, never making excuses or looking for shortcuts. Her ability to compartmentalise and give one hundred percent to her training speaks volumes about her mental toughness and dedication to the sport,” he said.\n\nGiven all she has accomplished, Danisha is proof that the road less travelled can often lead to extraordinary journeys.\n\nDanisha working as an embalmer at Goh Soon Moh Undertaker in 2022.\n\nPhoto: Tamil Murasu\n\nDanisha Mathialagan in the 48kg final at this year’s National Boxing Championships.\n\nPhoto: The \nStraits Times\n\n“In the ring, Danisha’s key strengths lie in her composure, calm confidence, sharp reflexes, ability to listen well and adapt mid-fight. What sets her apart from other boxers is her sheer tenacity.

Santosh Kumar\n\nBaithak, meaning “living room” in Hindi and Urdu, is a bold new initiative by multi-disciplinary artiste Rachna Anand that transforms home spaces into intimate theatres for plays, poetry readings and deep conversations.\n\nInspired by her father’s mantra “\n\nGuftagu jari rahe\n\n” (Conversations must go on), Baithak aims to revive meaningful dialogue in an age dominated by digital noise.\n\nOriginally from New Delhi, Rachna has lived in Singapore for over 40 years. Growing up, she experienced mushairas – intimate gatherings where poetry and stories were shared by the glow of a shama (lamp).\n\nWhen designing her home at Butterfly Avenue, Upper Serangoon, in 2016, the Singaporean envisioned it as a space for performances, ensuring a spacious living area that could serve as a modern-day mushaira.\n\nBaithak’s first production, Marking, directed by theatre exponent and arts educator Dr Edmund Chow and assisted by Rachna, is an unfiltered exploration of emotional, psychological and physical “marks” that shape individuals. Six actors from diverse backgrounds share deeply personal stories in a barrier-free, home setting, making the experience raw, immersive and profoundly impactful.\n\nThe three scheduled shows (March 21-23) sold out quickly, leading to an additional matinee. Each performance concludes with an open discussion where the audience of about 40 people can reflect, share and engage – over refreshments.\n\nBaithak follows a pay-as-you-can model with contributions starting at $25, while students attend for free. This keeps theatre accessible and affordable, unlike traditional productions where high venue costs drive up ticket prices.\n\nBeyond theatre, Baithak will host book readings, music discussions and poetry sessions, offering a counterpoint to the superficial interactions of social media.\n\nWhile home-based theatre is rare in Singapore’s Indian community, filmmaker and playwright Shilpa Krishnan first introduced the concept in February 2023 with The Living Room.\n\nWanting to experiment beyond film, the Singaporean staged the first edition at her friend Geeta Balagangadharan’s home in Pebble Bay condo, using real spaces to create an immersive storytelling experience.\n\n“It wasn’t about cutting costs,” Shilpa explained. “After 15 years in filmmaking, I wanted to see how a play would unfold in a real, lived-in space.”\n\nThe three original performances sold out in days, each with an audience of 26. Viewers were captivated by the uniqueness of the concept – experiencing a play inside a real home; the immersive use of space – not just the living room but also the dining area, kitchen and doorways; and the storytelling itself – rooted in cultural authenticity and real-life experiences.\n\nGeeta, who hosted the plays, said: “Unlike a theatre set, our home dictated the script – entryways, lighting and even furniture played a role.”\n\nShilpa donated all proceeds to charity.\n\nCoincidentally, The Living Room is being restaged at Geeta’s home from March 21–23, 2025. Tickets at $50 for the five shows are sold out.\n\nHome theatre is still a niche concept in Singapore, but France and Japan have long embraced intimate, non-traditional venues.\n\nShilpa believes that, while rewarding, home theatre requires significant effort. “It depends on whether people are willing to put in the time and energy for something with a limited audience capacity,” she said.\n\nRachna sees Baithak as more than just theatre – it’s a revival of deep, meaningful conversations.\n\n“Today’s youth are digitally connected but emotionally disconnected. Baithak is about reclaiming real human interaction,” she said.\n\nActor Aditya Mazumdar believes theatre will always evolve.\n\n“Art finds new ways to tell stories,” he said. “Home theatre will find its niche in Singapore, but it won’t be a replacement for commercial theatre.”\n\nAs Baithak and The Living Room gain momentum, they challenge the notion that theatre belongs only on grand stages.\n\nThese initiatives prove that all you need for great theatre is a story, a space and people ready to engage in real conversations.\n\nToday’s youth are digitally connected but emotionally disconnected. Baithak is about reclaiming real human interaction.\n\nRachna Anand", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a96563ca06d7f30ea3a9d07f7cac76b684614983e22eee675ba97dbc766df0c9?w=825", "alt_text": "The Living Room Show at Pebble Bay"}]}

Over time, these strategies helped her regain confidence and a sense of normalcy.\n\n“Even now, I still experience chemo brain occasionally, especially during school holidays when my brain is less active, but I’ve learnt to cope through self-care, mental exercises and support from family and friends,” she said.\n\nHer journey to recovery culminated in her participation as one of 20 pink warriors who walked the runway at the Courage Catwalk 2025 fashion show, adorned in vibrant costumes designed by six graduates from Lasalle College of the Arts, each reflecting Singapore’s rich cultural diversity.\n\nHeld at Sofitel Singapore City Centre on March 7 in conjunction with International Women’s Day, the event raised about $35,000 for the Breast Cancer Foundation.\n\nSpeaking to tabla! on the sidelines of the event, Mrs Parameswary said: “Every day of good health is a small, precious victory.”\n\nMrs Parameswary said her initial diagnosis in 2016 came as a shock – her routine mammogram revealed Stage 2 breast cancer despite having no family history.\n\nThe news was compounded a week later when doctors found a mass in her spine, raising concerns that it could be Stage 4.\n\nAs a mother of two young daughters, she feared what the diagnosis would mean for them.\n\nAt the time, her daughters were only six and 10 years old. While her younger daughter was too young to fully comprehend the situation, her elder daughter had lost a friend’s mother to breast cancer and was devastated. To help them cope, Mrs Parameswary made them part of her journey.\n\n“I brought them to the salon with me when I cut my hair very short and showed them videos explaining the side effects of chemotherapy, including hair loss and brittle nails,” she said.\n\nHer husband Rajit became her pillar of strength. “He was optimistic about my recovery, researching my diagnosis late into the night and finding the best oncologists for a second opinion,” she said.\n\nFurther tests revealed that the spinal mass was not cancerous but a permanent scar, possibly from a childhood injury. However, just as Mrs Parameswary was coming to terms with her own diagnosis, her mother-in-law fell critically ill and died soon after.\n\n“Even on the day that she passed on, my husband took me for my chemotherapy in the morning before leaving for his mother’s funeral that night as she lived overseas,” she said.\n\nBefore her 2016 cancer diagnosis, Mrs Parameswary left full-time teaching in 2014 to care for her ailing mother, aunt and cousin.\n\nShe balanced caregiving with private tuition until her cancer treatment forced her to pause.\n\nWhile undergoing eight cycles of chemotherapy, a mastectomy and other treatments, she continued to care for her bedridden mother, who was battling a form of Parkinson’s disease for 13 years.\n\n“Even when my mother could no longer communicate well, I knew she was always worried about me,” she said.\n\nDetermined to balance both their battles, Mrs Parameswary scheduled her mother’s medical appointments at least a week after her chemotherapy sessions, giving herself time to recover from the nausea and exhaustion.\n\nHer mother died in February 2021, a loss that reinforced Mrs Parameswary’s commitment to living a meaningful life.\n\n“She taught me to face life’s toughest battles with grace. Whenever I felt weak, I thought of her and reminded myself that I, too, had the strength to overcome,” she said.\n\nDeclared cancer-free in 2017, Mrs. Parameswary turned to her lifelong passion, bharatanatyam, for healing, resuming lessons in 2019 after a decade-long break.\n\nTeaching under MOE’s Flexi-Adjunct and later Contract-Adjunct schemes helped her combat chemo brain and regain focus. Despite emotional and physical scars, she emerged resilient.\n\nGrateful for her support system, she hopes to inspire others, saying: “You are stronger than you think. Acknowledging your feelings is key to healing.”\n\n“Even now, I still experience chemo brain occasionally, especially during school holidays when my brain is less active, but I’ve learnt to cope through self-care, mental exercises and support from family and friends.”\n\nMrs Parameswary Veerasingam", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2998bfcc3b0c6e2e4ab54494fd83c892449506ea9a8ef2e01bfae26da50f0239?w=825", "alt_text": "Mrs Parameswary Veerasingam walking the runway at the Courage Catwalk 2025 fashion show."}]}

She was neither a seasoned trekker nor an experienced mountaineer – just a woman with an extraordinary dream. But, instead of being discouraged, she took it as a challenge.\n\nDetermined to be physically prepared, she spent four months rigorously training. Her routine included walking three hours daily, wearing trekking boots to adapt to discomfort, and covering about six kilometres in the evenings.\n\nShe also made a unique preparation – learning Hindi – so she could communicate effectively in Nepal.\n\nHer journey wasn’t just about endurance; it was about proving to herself and others that age and background should never limit ambition.\n\nEven before reaching the starting point of her trek, Madam Vasanthy encountered difficulties. Her flight to Lukla, the usual gateway to Everest, was cancelled due to bad weather. Many in her situation would have turned back, but Madam Vasanthy refused to give up.\n\nInstead, she found an alternative route to Surke with the help of a German couple she met along the way. From there, she embarked on the challenging trek, facing unpredictable terrain, freezing temperatures and altitude sickness risks.\n\nEach day presented new hurdles. The steep inclines, narrow trails and deep ravines made the journey physically demanding. She walked six to seven hours daily, frequently pausing to catch her breath.\n\n“I needed more time, so I walked slowly, using a stick for support. Every few steps, I paused to take at least five breaths to avoid exhaustion,” she told Manorama.\n\nDespite these struggles, she pressed on, driven by her dream. Along the way, she met fellow trekkers from around the world, including a father-son duo from Thiruvananthapuram, which made the journey even more memorable.\n\nMadam Vasanthy’s journey became an Internet sensation after a photo of her at EBC, proudly waving the Indian flag in a traditional Kasavu saree, went viral. Her story resonated with many, especially women and older individuals, who often feel limited by societal norms.\n\nBut this isn’t her first solo adventure. Last year, she travelled alone to Thailand after her friends backed out, doubting whether a woman could undertake such a journey by herself. Unfazed, she went anyway, proving her resilience once again.\n\nUnlike many adventurers who seek sponsorships or financial backing, Madam Vasanthy funds her travels through her tailoring business. Occasionally, her sons, Vineeth and Vivek, contribute, but her trips are primarily self-financed.\n\nHer passion for travel isn’t about luxury – it’s about experiences. She saves up for her adventures, making them all the more rewarding.\n\nConquering EBC was just the beginning. Now, Madam Vasanthy has set her sights on her next big dream – the Great Wall of China.\n\n“I needed more time, so I walked slowly, using a stick for support.

London-based pianist Anirudh Krishna described it as “surreal,” while University of Leicester lecturer Sylvian Patrick Jesudoss noted that decoding the symphony’s tonal shifts could take years.\n\nSuch was the impact that the violinists, at the end of the performance, requested an encore of the third movement, a rare gesture highlighting its brilliance.\n\nAlthough Valiant contained no film background scores, Ilaiyaraaja delighted audiences with an orchestral medley of his iconic compositions, including Poove Sempoove, Raaja Raajathi and Madai Thirandhu.\n\nThe orchestra also performed scores from Guru and India’s first animated film Pandavas.\n\nMr Jesudoss was particularly moved when Ilaiyaraaja sang Idhayam Poguthe as the orchestra played Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony.\n\nTamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin praised Ilaiyaraaja ahead of the event, calling Valiant the “crown jewel” of his countless achievements.\n\nWith a career spanning over four decades, Ilaiyaraaja’s influence on Indian music remains profound. His symphony debut cements his legacy as a global musical icon, bridging cinematic and classical music on an unprecedented scale.\n\nIlaiyaraaja earning applause after the London show.\n\nPhoto: @rameshlaus/X", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5a42b437891a29a3a529416f7b8ae300bccf99fc13b03e85da9c9c5afa5ebeb6?w=825", "alt_text": "Ilaiyaraaja presented western classical symphony in London."}]}

In India when we say we will do something “by tomorrow”, we mean we’ll get to it in the next 10 to 15 days, God willing.\n\nLikewise, if we observed the full moon “just yesterday”, we may have seen it during the last week (and perhaps it had not been really, completely full). And on both occasions, we’d say\n\n“kal”\n\n, an accommodating Hindi word meaning both tomorrow and yesterday.\n\nBut, for Singaporeans, time is not a loose bathrobe; it’s a skin-tight Spandex bathing suit.\n\nAs a newbie here, I learnt this the hard way. Singtel’s help desk told me that a technician would come home the next day between 11am and 1pm and would phone me when nearby.\n\nMy phone rang at 10.15am the next day. “From Singtel,” the man said crisply. “I’m nearby. Can I come now?”\n\n“Oh my God!” I cried. “I’m not at home now.” He said: “No problem, I’ll come at 11 am.”\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said. “I had to travel to Malaysia on urgent work.” (I was in Melaka with my family for sightseeing but thought it prudent to sacrifice honesty at the altar of diplomacy.)\n\nThe man kindly agreed to come the following day, and did, landing up before the appointed time.\n\nIn contrast, when you explain your problem to the plumber or electrician in India, they will invariably say:\n\n“Kal aa jaayenge”\n\n(will come tomorrow).\n\nYou can reasonably travel to a neighbouring city for sightseeing the next day; in fact you could even squeeze in a neighbouring country.\n\nBecause their\n\n“kal”\n\nmeans you need to call them in a week to remind them; then again a day or two after that. Finally, in the fullness of time, they will arrive.\n\nMeanwhile something else at home would’ve conked off, and you can get two jobs done through one appointment.\n\nYou encounter the same tendency of promising the moon but delivering a half-baked pancake on the road.\n\nOnce I had only 20 minutes to make it for an appointment in India. Waiting anxiously at a traffic signal, I asked the taxi driver how much longer. He promised to drop me off in “five minutes”.\n\nI felt reassured, but, when I found myself stuck at the same signal five minutes later, not so much. So I asked the question again.\n\n“Five minutes,” he said again and added, with quiet confidence: “Just let this signal turn green.”\n\nLike this, a painful “five minutes” at a time, I was dropped off 45 minutes later. (The person I was meeting rendered me early by arriving even later.)\n\nIn my early days in Singapore, I similarly had 20 minutes to make my appointment when I got into the taxi. But when I asked “how long”, the cabbie, instead of reassuring me, added to my angst.\n\n“Half an hour,” he said. “Bad traffic. Also weather not good. Road slippery already.”\n\nThen he dropped me off in 15 minutes, well in time for my appointment. (But the person I was meeting was already there.)\n\nIn India, it is normal to be invited for dinner at 7pm but actually landing up then would be a severe breach of manners. The hosts would still be cooking dinner or shopping for ice or relaxing at the park with the kids.\n\nIt is customary for the first guest to arrive after 8pm and the last around 10.30, just before dinner is served.\n\nSo, in my early days in Singapore, when I received an invitation for dinner at 7pm from a colleague, I told my wife: “We should leave at 8 to reach his place at 8.30. “That means,” I added, to convey the gravity of the situation, “you need to be ready by 7.55.”\n\n“Absolutely,” she said, and promptly came out dressed: At 8.45pm.\n\nAs we reached the host’s door at 9.15pm, it opened, and we met the other guests, leaving after their dinner.\n\nMuch embarrassment ensued. I apologised for our tardiness; my wife followed; my colleague apologised for not taking my phone number and therefore not being able to call me; his wife apologised for serving the dinner without us; the four guests individually apologised for eating it.\n\nSo, if you’ve newly arrived from India, learn from my experience and don’t repeat my gaffes.\n\nMoving from India to Singapore may take only a few hours, but it represents a unique form of time travel.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/091f555c3fc7d94637593bcecf7cb4288a5cdc413c8f9b59b3a761815a9c6f89?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

I knew only one thing about her – she is a mother who fought a long battle to bring her daughter’s rapist to justice. As a woman who could sympathise with the weight of her burden, I knew I had to meet her.\n\nA quick search informed me of the many hats Mrs Tiwari wore. Entrepreneur, journalist and an activist, to name a few. But none held a candle to her role as a mother, as I would soon find out.\n\nI arrived early for the interview and settled into a corner booth in Wild Honey at Mandarin Gallery, a cafe of Mrs Tiwari’s choice.\n\nMy head was buried in my phone, scrolling through the document of questions I had prepared, when I heard a faint “Hi!”.\n\nI looked up and there she was, a petite woman with a crown of wise greys, carrying a bag nearly as big as her. She sat down, I introduced myself and she replied: “First, order something. Get yourself some food and a drink, it’s on me.”\n\nOnce the pleasantries were out of the way, Mrs Tiwari, an Indian based in Singapore, pulled a book titled “Against All Odds” out of her bag. This was the book she wrote documenting the gruelling six years she spent in courtrooms fighting her daughter’s rapist.\n\nJustice systems often fail to protect women, subjecting them to arduous processes to fight for justice. In Mrs Tiwari’s case, the severity of her pursuit only served to embolden her. “Not many are willing to publicly admit that their child has been raped because they think it is humiliating,” she said.\n\nTo her, “not fighting was not an option. If you don’t report, you are stuck with it. It is already something the victim is forced to live with, but if you don’t speak up, life becomes harder,” she said.\n\nThe family’s ordeal began almost 15 years ago after Mrs Tiwari, who was abroad, chatted with her daughter, the youngest of her three children, in Mumbai on a video call. After the call, her daughter left for a party in town.\n\n“The call ended and I went to bed. Usually, I stay awake until my children come home but this day I did not. It remains my biggest regret. Why did I sleep?” she said.\n\n“I remember she was fully clothed when I had called her the night before. But when we found her, she was not,” Mrs Tiwari added. Her daughter was found in the lobby of her apartment in Mumbai the next morning by her elder sister. Mrs Tiwari also has a son.\n\nShe took the next flight to Mumbai and reached her distraught daughter. “Ever wonder what a mother, a sister and a brother have to go through when they see the aftermath of a violent and brutal act?” She said the family made a pact to only ask her questions about the incident when she was ready to talk about it.\n\nMrs Tiwari reported the case the next day and soon began a court battle that would usurp her life. “I had to get my answers,” she said.\n\nHer days and nights were filled with liaising with the Mumbai police to gather all the evidence she could to put her daughter’s rapist behind bars. Mrs Tiwari was shown a glimpse of the video clip where her daughter staggers into the lobby and collapses. “It was enough to scar me for life,” she said in her book, which is available for purchase on Amazon.\n\nThe rapist had dismantled her daughter’s phone by removing its sim-card and battery, hiding it in different places. The rape was pre-meditated.\n\nBased on the recovered CCTV footage, the Mumbai police were able to trace the victim’s last steps and find the crime scene, less than 100 metres away from the gate of her building, where they found her leggings, boots, panties and a cigarette butt.\n\nThrough the years, Mrs Tiwari shared that she not only faced criticism but was also ostracised by her extended family because of the shame.\n\nWhile her husband remained in Singapore to maintain a steady flow of income, Mrs Tiwari dealt with court appearances on her own.\n\n“It is not cheap to fight for justice,” she said. “Someone had to keep earning for the family while I flew to Mumbai to fight the case.”\n\nShe also learnt that fighting for justice is a lonely process and rape conviction rates in India were dismal. From 2018 to 2022, conviction rates were roughly one in four according to the National Crime Records Bureau.\n\nThen came the ordeal of facing her daughter’s rapist during every court appearance. “Can you imagine having to sit there in front of him?” she asked me.\n\nSix long years later, the case concluded, and the rapist was sentenced to 10 years in jail.\n\nBut the truth is, when you are a victim of such a brazen crime, justice does not always feel like a ‘win’. Mrs Tiwari’s journey of resilience did not end with the courtroom victory. In fact, it marked the beginning of a new chapter in her life.\n\nToday, she is a life mentor for women, a mental health and well-being counsellor and a podcaster.\n\n“I want to be that voice,” Mrs Tiwari said, “the one that reminds people, especially women, that they are not defined by what happens to them. We are defined by how we rise after it.”\n\nThe story of her daughter’s rape is interspersed through the book, which does not only discuss her tribulations, but also those that women around the world experience daily.\n\n“A woman’s struggle has not lessened,” she said, as she quotes cases such as Nirbhaya – the brutal gang-rape and murder in 2012 that left India shaken and reverberated throughout the world.\n\nThe mention of Nirbhaya took me back to when I first learned about the details of the rape. I was all of 14, freshly returned to Singapore from a school trip to the very city where the rape had occurred – New Delhi. I would later find out that the bus we travelled on had taken a route similar to the bus where the gang rape had happened – a sobering revelation for a 14 year old.\n\nFrom harassment at workplaces to marital rape, Mrs Tiwari told me that so much needs to be done – starting with being loud about the injustices imposed on women. “With all the bureaucracy, internalised misogyny, regressive thinking, where does one even begin to fix the problem?”\n\nAs the conversation drew to a close, I found myself momentarily lost for words, riddled with hopelessness. I felt the weight of everything she had shared – the pain, the perseverance, and the unrelenting courage that shaped her into the activist she is today.\n\nMy first impression of Mrs Tiwari proved right – her spirit was indeed so much bigger than her frame.\n\nMrs Sujata Tiwari at the launch of her book Against All Odds.\n\nPhoto: Sujata Tiwari\n\n“I remember she was fully clothed when I had called her the night before.

His commitment to this duty remained unshaken, even in the face of personal tragedy.\n\nOn Nov 4 2023, a day before Theemithi, the annual firewalking ceremony, his wife Madam Malliga was hospitalised for breathlessness but still urged him to prioritise his temple duty. “Please tow the chariot, then come back to visit me,” she told him. Those were her last words to him.\n\nAs Mr Rajendran towed Sri Mariamman Temple’s silver chariot, he received a devastating call from his daughter: “Amma’s heart stopped. She’s on life support.” He completed his task and rushed to the hospital at 1am, when Madam Malliga briefly responded to his presence before passing away later that morning at age 59.\n\nOn Feb 22 2025, Mr Rajendran was honoured for 20 years of service at Arulmigu Velmurugan Gnanamuneeswarar Temple’s annual chariot procession. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean presented the award, after which Mr Rajendran towed the chariot once again.\n\nLater that evening, he received another plaque from the Thaipusam Joint Committee, a collaboration between the Chettiars’ Temple Society, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple and the Hindu Endowments Board. Dedicating the awards to his late wife, he said with tears streaming down his face: “Without her, I am nobody. My only wish is that these awards go to her.”\n\nMr Rajendran and Madam Malliga married in 1982 and built Raja Towing Services, later expanding it into Rajaa Temple Service in 2000.\n\nInitially handling administration, Madam Malliga, with Mr Rajendran’s encouragement, earned her Class 3 and Class 4 licences and a Taxi Driver’s Vocational Licence. From 2000 to 2022, she towed temple chariots herself, breaking gender norms in a male-dominated industry.\n\nHer support for Mr Rajendran went beyond their business – she ensured he never missed a procession, woke him on time, prepared his meals, and even drove a backup tow truck. “Even the attire I wore to award functions was stitched by her,” he said.\n\nThough Madam Malliga is gone, their children have stepped up. His son Ganissh, 35, now drives the tow truck, while his daughters manage operations. “My children have been a big support to me since young, whether it was washing vehicles or preparing them for towing chariots,” Mr Rajendran said.\n\nHis fleet of tow trucks remains active, but one is reserved for temple chariot processions. “For 41 years, this tow truck has served temples. I have dedicated it to temple duties,” he said.\n\nSM Teo, who has known Mr Rajendran for many years, described him as “a man with a very big heart”. At Madam Malliga’s funeral, SM Teo asked Mr Rajendran whether he would continue towing the chariot, to which Mr Rajendran had replied without hesitation: “I will continue towing till my last breath.”\n\nGuided by the words of former President SR Nathan, who once advised him to “do things never expecting anything in return”, Mr Rajendran’s selfless dedication to temple service remains unwavering.\n\nMr Rajendran Krishnasamy and his late wife, Mdm Malliga.\n\nPhoto: Saraswathy Rajendran", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bccbaad73fb23e5ecc0980578b59c2049a2076e232f5bb4da21009cabd3dd40b?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Rajendran Krishnasamy with Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean after being honoured."}]}

Kavi\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nFor Mr Nikesh Mehta, the British High Commissioner to Singapore, the Gujarati way of life is more than just heritage – it is an identity woven into his very being.\n\n“My mum made me go to a Gujarati school in Wembley every Saturday,” he recalls. “I hated it, but I had to take Gujarati lessons in the morning and music lessons in the afternoon.”\n\nMusic was a family affair, albeit a reluctant one.\n\nWhile Mr Mehta learnt the tabla under a renowned teacher, his brother was trained in the harmonium. Their mother would enthusiastically encourage – sometimes force – them to play together, singing along herself.\n\n“It was horrible,” Mr Mehta says with a laugh, “but I love the sound of the tabla and Indian musical instruments.”\n\nThough he no longer plays, the memories remain, as does his fluency in Gujarati, a language he was required to master, especially to communicate with his grandmother, who “professed not to speak English” – though Mr Mehta suspects otherwise.\n\nThe 47-year-old High Commissioner’s connection to Gujarat traces back to his great-grandparents, who hailed from a small village called Gunda in Jamnagar.\n\nLike many Indians, they migrated to East Africa in the early 20th century, when the British were building the East Africa Railway. They later established businesses, with his mother growing up in Uganda and father in Kenya.\n\nThen came 1972.\n\nUnder Idi Amin’s rule, 80,000 South Asians were ordered to leave Uganda within 90 days. Mr Mehta’s mother, then a young woman, witnessed the brutality firsthand.\n\n“His soldiers came to my mum’s house, put a gun to her head, and demanded money and jewellery,” Mr Mehta recounts. “They made it clear the family had only weeks before they were thrown out.”\n\nLike 27,200 others, Mr Mehta’s mother and grandparents fled to the United Kingdom, leaving behind everything they had built.\n\nBut starting all over in the UK was far from easy. The 1970s and 80s were rife with racism, and integrating into British society was a challenge.\n\n“For anyone from an ethnic minority, life was tough,” Mr Mehta said. “Many people feared immigration would disrupt the UK, but my mother always felt deep gratitude that Britain gave them a home.”\n\nDetermined to rebuild, she secured a place in a nursing school near Newcastle and later worked for the National Health Service for 40 years, mostly in the same hospital.\n\nLike many Indian families at the time, the Mehtas lived together in one house with 15 relatives. Mr Mehta, his parents and his brother shared a bedroom until they could afford to move to Harrow.\n\nLife as a British-Indian child was complex. Football matches at Wembley Stadium could be terrifying, as he and his family were often the only ethnic minorities in the crowd. His father would warn them to be careful – one wrong word could lead to trouble.\n\nYet, the expectation at home was clear: Success.\n\n“Growing up, the dinner table conversations were always about becoming a doctor, lawyer, accountant – never about civil service, let alone diplomacy,” he says. “We thought it was a career for the white majority, not for immigrants like us.”\n\nMr Mehta pursued a degree and master’s in chemistry at University College London and had a PhD lined up. But an advertisement caught his eye – a teaching job in Japan.\n\n“I wasn’t sure I wanted to spend my life in a lab coat,” he admitted.\n\nHis time in Japan changed everything. Teaching in a rural town, he found himself acting as a de facto ambassador for British culture. His passion for international relations grew, as did his realisation that diplomacy could be a path for him.\n\nEncouraged by a friend, he looked into the Foreign Office.\n\n“I had no idea what it was,” he said with a laugh. “But the more I read, the more excited I became.”\n\nIn 2002, Mr Mehta passed the exams and joined the British Foreign Service.\n\nThe Foreign Office was intimidating.\n\n“I felt like a fish out of water,” he said. “The grand buildings, the formal language, the way people dressed – I didn’t see anyone who looked like me in senior roles.”\n\nDesperate to fit in, he used his first pay cheque to buy a pinstripe suit and a long umbrella, mimicking the stereotypical British diplomat.\n\nBut his perspective changed in Iraq, his first posting. There, he realised that his diverse background was a strength, not a weakness.\n\n“Some of the hang-ups were my own,” he said. “There were times when some seniors didn’t accept me in the way that I would have liked, but I definitely felt that I was self-censoring. I didn’t express my true views, didn’t challenge, because I almost wanted to hide in the corner. It took a long time to lift that cloak, and to have the confidence to express my views.”\n\nOver the next 22 years, Mr Mehta climbed the ranks, serving in Uganda, Malaysia and South Korea. In Uganda, he took his mother and grandmother back to their ancestral village for the first time in 30 years – a deeply emotional journey.\n\n“Every time I met President (Yoweri) Museveni, he would say, ‘You’re really Ugandan’. And I’d say, ‘I’m British’.”\n\nIn July 2024, Mr Mehta was appointed the British High Commissioner to Singapore, becoming the first non-white to assume the post.\n\n“It’s the best job I’ve ever had,” he said.\n\nSingapore is a natural fit for Mr Mehta. The UK and Singapore now have a Strategic Partnership, a Digital Economy Agreement, and a Green Economy Framework, with bilateral trade worth £22 billion.\n\n“This year, we celebrate 60 years of UK-Singapore relations. We were the first to recognise Singapore’s independence, and now we’re building a modern partnership for the future,” he said.\n\nBeyond work, Mr Mehta, who lives here with his Australian wife and two children, immerses himself in Singapore’s culture and history, engaging with the Indian, Chinese and Malay communities, exploring heritage sites, and indulging in local cuisine.\n\nHe has also brought his Gujarati roots to his official residence. Eden Hall is now a vegetarian-only space.\n\n“It’s part of my upbringing, but it’s also about sustainability,” he explains. “We’re trying to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\n“I’m immensely proud of being a British High Commissioner, but your heritage is important. I will always feel deeply passionate about the connection between the UK and India and between the UK and Singapore through the Indian community.”\n\nMr Mehta is also a die-hard Liverpool fan, watching matches regardless of time zones. Cricket, too, remains a passion.\n\nHe is proud of how far Britain has come in diversity and inclusion.\n\n“We have one of the most diverse parliaments in the world,” he said. “Rishi Sunak was prime minister, David Lammy as foreign secretary, and so many ethnic minorities in leadership – it’s proof that if you’re talented, you can rise to the top.”\n\nEven in business, some of Britain’s wealthiest and most successful individuals are from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\n“The UK isn’t free from challenges in integrating communities, but I’m proud of the journey we’ve taken on race,” said Mr Mehta.\n\nWith his brother and parents after he was awarded the Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2014 for his contribution to British foreign policy and diversity.\n\nPhoto: Nikesh Mehta\n\n“I’m immensely proud of being a British High Commissioner, but your heritage is important.

If his Indian passport surrender request is accepted, he may become an illegal alien in the UK, as he would no longer hold any valid nationality.\n\nMr Modi responded by dismissing reports of pending legal cases against him, calling them “media fiction” and accusing news outlets of spreading “fake news”.\n\nHe insisted that he had never been formally charged in any court and that his only achievement was creating the IPL, which has since become a multi-billion-dollar global cricket league.\n\nMr Modi’s case has highlighted India’s growing concern over tax evasion and offshore citizenship schemes, reported te Economic Times.\n\nVanuatu has become a preferred destination for wealthy Indians and NRIs, with its quick and low-cost naturalisation process offering tax benefits and financial secrecy.

He claimed he vomited, passed out on a lounge chair, and woke up to find Ms Konanki missing. Security cameras recorded him returning to his hotel room at 8.55am.\n\nDespite his inconsistent statements, Mr Ribe is not considered a suspect and is cooperating with investigators, according to Dominican National Police spokesman Diego Pesqueira.\n\nHowever, Ms Konanki’s family believes she may have been kidnapped, questioning why her body has not washed ashore if she drowned, reported India Today.\n\nHer clothes were found on a portable beach chair near the water, but her phone and wallet remained with her friends, which her father, Mr Subbarayudu Konanki, said was unusual behaviour.\n\nAuthorities have deployed drones, helicopters, boats and scuba divers to search the coastline. The Dominican Civil Defence, National Police and Navy, alongside US federal agencies including the FBI, DEA and Homeland Security Investigations, are involved in the efforts.\n\nDominican officials say they suspect drowning, but Ms Konanki’s father has requested an expanded investigation.\n\n“If she was in the water, she should have washed up by now. If she’s not in the ocean, where is she?” said family friend Ramprakash Krishnamanaidu.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh community has expressed deep concern, with students calling for answers. “No one expects their loved one to go on vacation and not return,” said student Halley Katz.\n\nAs the search continued on Wednesday, authorities were reviewing surveillance footage from nearby resorts and interrogating multiple witnesses, hoping to solve the mystery of Ms Konanki’s disappearance.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/422ef2879293d36e8a8f8fef1243d222df49f7aeba0b364d518c78fca7e9a165?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

But what led to such a massive financial setback?\n\nA key factor behind the industry-wide losses was the failure of major star-studded films. Even projects featuring Suriya, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth failed to draw audiences as expected.\n\nSuriya’s much-hyped Kanguva, made on a Rs350 crore budget, was projected to gross Rs1,000 crore, but managed only Rs106 crore.\n\nSimilarly, Shankar’s Indian 2, with a Rs250 crore budget, earned just Rs150 crore, and Rajinikanth’s Vettaiyan underperformed, leaving producers and distributors reeling.\n\nProducer and distributor G. Dhananjeyan explained: “Big-budget films like Indian 2, Kanguva and Vettaiyan failed, while only The Greatest of All Time (GOAT) starring Vijay was a box office success.”\n\nIn contrast to 2023, which saw multiple hits like Jailer, Leo, Ponniyin Selvan 2, Varisu, and Thunivu, 2024 had only 18 successful films, resulting in a dismal seven per cent success rate, with 150 films failing to even recover marketing costs.\n\nWhile Tamil cinema traditionally sees a mix of big-budget and smaller successful films, even low and mid-budget movies struggled in 2024. Trade analyst Ramesh Bala noted: “Every year, around 30-40 films succeed, but 2024 saw a failure of both big and small films. Weak scripts, poor execution and changing audience expectations led to rejections.”\n\nHowever, a few small and medium-budget films like Garudan, Lubber Pandhu, DeMonte Colony 2 and Vaazhai did well, proving that strong storytelling remains key to box office success.\n\nThe Tamil audience has become more discerning, favouring quality scripts and performances over star power and lavish productions.\n\nThis trend was evident in early 2025, when Shankar’s Game Changer (Tamil version) earned just Rs10 crore, while two smaller Tamil films – Madha Gaj Raja and Kudumbasthan – became major hits, grossing over Rs70 crore and Rs10 crore, respectively.\n\nDespite the setbacks of 2024, Kollywood remains optimistic about a stronger 2025. Upcoming films like Ajith Kumar’s Vidaamuyarchi, Rajinikanth’s Coolie, Kamal Haasan’s Thug Life and Suriya’s Retro are expected to revive the industry.\n\nDhananjeyan remains hopeful, saying: “Last year was challenging, but we anticipate a bigger success ratio in 2025 with stronger films.”\n\nWhether Kollywood can bounce back remains to be seen, but the focus on content-driven storytelling may be the key to reversing its fortunes.\n\n“Every year, around 30-40 films succeed, but 2024 saw a failure of both big and small films.

His ultimate goal is to eventually run his tattoo and hair salon full time.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nAnusha Selvamani\n\nMr Jathishweran Naidu straddles two vastly different worlds.\n\nBy day, he works in the compliance department of an insurance company. By night, he runs his own business as a tattoo artist.\n\n“I aspired to become a lawyer but working as a paralegal made me realise that something was missing,” said the 30-year-old graduate in business and psychology from the Singapore University of Social Sciences. “I have always had an artistic side and loved art since young.”\n\nTen years ago, when Mr Jathishweran wanted to get a tattoo, he sketched a Hindu mythological character called Yali and gave it to his tattoo artist.\n\n“When my artist Bing from Skingraphix saw my sketch, he was shocked and asked me to consider becoming a tattoo artist,” he said.\n\nEventually Mr Jathishweran decided to apprentice under Bing, even though his parents were unhappy with his decision.\n\n“There is a stereotype in our society that if you have a tattoo or if you are a tattoo artist you are affiliated with the wrong things. I wanted to break this thinking and prove that tattoos are just an art form,” said Mr Jathishweran.\n\nHe began by drawing tattoos for his close friends and family members.\n\n“When I first started I bought all the tools and converted my room into a mini tattoo studio. There were times when I had no space to sleep in my room,” he recalled. “I remember my first tattoo experience when a family member asked me to tattoo his zodiac sign. I was so nervous.”\n\nHis confidence grew and he decided to start a tattoo business.\n\nFive years ago, he found a location at the void deck of Block 249 Jurong East and named it 101.Ink. But paying a hefty sum of money on monthly rentals did not make sense if he were to run his tattoo business only in the evenings, after his day job.\n\n“I decided to combine two businesses into the same space. At the front is a hair salon and at the back is my cosy tattoo studio,” said Mr Jathishweran.\n\nHis hair salon has four employees and the front space can accommodate up to two customers at the same time. “I decided to manage both my day job and tattoo artistry simultaneously rather than abandoning one of them. It is a double life for me,” he said.\n\nAfter his day job in Changi, Mr Jathishweran drives to his tattoo studio at the other end of the island to attend to his clients on an appointment basis.\n\nThere are times when he has tattoo appointments well into the night, beyond the hair salon operating hours. He sees about 20 clients a month.\n\nMr Jathishweran practices the Indian style of tattooing.\n\n“The tattoo industry is always evolving and I keep up with the trends via social media. In the old days, people practiced the artwork on poultry meat and animal skin. But now we have dummy hands and technology has vastly improved,” he said.\n\n“At the end of the day, I am just following what makes me happy. I never see tattoos as work.”\n\nHe hopes to eventually run his tattoo and hair salon business full time.\n\nSupporting him throughout his journey is his wife L. Umamageyswari, 31, who works in the healthcare industry.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/eded370a04816421ffe519b342ab0e7c84fce6cfc34e71c37974e23ae1bf3923?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Jathishweran never saw tattoos as work.

Now, he claims to have transformed personally and artistically, determined to reclaim his place in the industry, reported Observer World.\n\nSingh, born Hridesh Singh, rose to fame 15 years ago with his bold lyrics and infectious beats, becoming a household name. His music dominated parties and weddings, reshaping India’s hip-hop scene.\n\nHowever, at the peak of his success, he disappeared from the public eye. Behind the scenes, fame had led him down a dark path.\n\nStruggling with drug and alcohol addiction, Singh suffered a breakdown during a 2017 concert, forcing him to step away. He now claims to have been clean for seven years, except for the occasional beer, reported the BBC.\n\nAs he returns, Singh reflects on his past with honesty, admitting: “Drugs destroyed me completely.” He acknowledges the toll his lifestyle took on his mental health and relationships, earning respect for his candidness.\n\nHis comeback, however, arrives at a time when India’s hip-hop scene has evolved, with new artistes shaping the genre in fresh directions. Singh insists his music has also matured, moving away from themes of drugs and partying toward deeper storytelling.\n\nDespite his efforts, some fans feel his new work lacks the edge that once defined him. Music journalist Bhanuj Kappal suggests his style may feel outdated in today’s music landscape, though Honey remains undeterred: “A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that,” he admits, embracing the criticism with optimism.\n\nHowever, controversy is never far from Singh. A week ago, he released his latest track Maniac from the album Glory. The upbeat song blends urban slang, and is trending high on the music charts, but it did not go down well with Patna-born actress Neetu Chandra, who filed a public interest litigation in the Patna High Court complaining against alleged vulgarity.\n\nShe cited concerns over the song’s “overt sexualisation”  and treating women as mere objects, reported Republic World. Neetu further alleged that the song uses “Bhojpuri language to normalise vulgarity” and throws “women’s empowerment out of the window”.\n\nUndeterred by the issue, Singh now presents himself as a “God-fearing man” who believes in positive energies and fate. His redefined identity is reflected in his music, as he attempts to rewrite his legacy.\n\nDetermined to prove he’s not just a relic of the past, Singh confidently declares: “I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven.”\n\nAs he embarks on this new chapter, audiences remain divided – some sceptical, others willing to give him another chance.\n\nIndian rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.\n\nPhoto: @YoYoHoneySingh/ Instagram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/df9b0cdd2db1d4430bb3a557e43f1c2a3e567565fab0f4698d9bc5579d9ec220?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh."}]}

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/community/opinion/olympics-one-upmanship", "site_title": "The Olympics of one-upmanship", "publish_date": null, "content": "Community\n\nThe Olympics of one-upmanship\n\nUPDATED\n\nMar 13, 2025, 5:34 PM\n\nDaisy Irani\n\nRecently when I attend dinners and events, I notice that the parry and thrust of “one-upmanship” has increased to colossal proportions.\n\nSingapore may not have four seasons, but it has one constant climate: competitive humidity.\n\nFrom the moment we show up in Singapore, we switch into upgrade mode, which is a good thing except when it is done to provide a good gloat over everyone else in our ambit.\n\nIt’s an art form, a lifestyle and, at times, a full-contact sport.\n\nWhatever you do, there’s always someone who has done it better, gone one step further. Not acceptable!!\n\nIn a country as small as Singapore, where everyone’s successes are visible, the pressure to keep up has never been higher.\n\nI, my husband, my children have to be smarter, richer, wiser, better wed, better employed, better connected, better endowed, all with better zen than everyone else or we face relegation like a non-performing football team.\n\nBetter Zen? Yep. Even the singular art of bringing one down to earth – meditation – is charged with competition.\n\nOnce upon a time, inviting people home for dinner used to be a simple, fun-filled “have some laughs” activity. Now, in some social circles, it’s all about out-cooking your friends.\n\nIf you are a simple chicken curry or thair sadam hostess, forget about it. Now, every dinner gathering is an unofficial Masterchef episode.\n\nThe conversation goes something like this... Puja: “I always make my butter chicken from scratch”.  Reema: “Oh, I use a secret family recipe from my grandmother in Punjab. The spices were hand-ground by monks in the Himalayas.” Kavita: “ I use intermolecular gastronomy. My biryani is infused with saffron air.”\n\nAnd then someone serves a Japanese style, sous vide, sake-infused matcha – smoked Wagyu steak!\n\nMy solution: To outwit the competition, I host a potluck, so everyone brings their own dish, and, in a twist of genius, I make them compete against each other! Heng Ah!\n\nSo, while our potluck is on (with the Noritake dishes because the Sentosa crowd can’t eat in less) the men are standing near the bar quarrelling about who owns the best single malt collection, until the subject turns to wealth accumulation. This separates the men from the boys.\n\nAmrish: “I bought on the dip, doubled my investment!” Bhoumick: “Oh I saw the dip coming long before you. Bought super low, sold super high, tripled my investments!” Kumar: “Stock market? Hah! I don’t even look at the stock market. My money works for me whilst I meditate! Adani has asked me for my secret. Not sharing.”\n\nSo, as I’m collecting the wine for the ladies, I wonder, does anyone here actually lose money ? Except my husband who makes a habit of it. Or maybe it’s just the French Bordeaux that the ladies insist on drinking that is sinking the family fortunes.\n\nOh, and while they are sipping their vino, they are at their observant best. A complete inventory of who is wearing what is established followed by whispered allegations of which of the night’s Chanel bags, Hermes scarfs and Jimmy Choo shoes are rip offs or second hand.\n\nThe conversation inevitably moves to their children. Puja: “My grandson is in a gifted class.” Reema: “Oh, my granddaughter is in Mensa.” Ranjani: “My toddler has my genes... he’s coding Python.” Suchitra: “My newborn just got an internship at Google!”\n\nThis I realise is the “Keeping Up with the Kiasus” effect. Kiasu one-upmanship has always existed, but Singapore’s prosperity has taken it to new heights.\n\nSingapore is small, which means everything is in plain sight - your neighbour’s new car, your colleague’s condo upgrade, your friend’s child winning yet another academic award. And, because success is so visible, it’s impossible to escape the silent competition to prove we’re thriving too.\n\nBut the ultimate battle ground of FB, Insta and TikTok have turned life into a performance. Everything must be carefully curated – holiday photos, food choices, even gym workouts.\n\nIf it’s not on social media it didn’t really happen!\n\nOne-upmanship can be fun, but it also creates unnecessary pressure. It turns life into a constant competition where satisfaction is always out of reach.\n\nIf you really want to win this game, stop competing. Live without the need to prove anything. And, if that’s too hard, at least pretend you don’t care. Meditate!\n\nOh no, even meditation has been turned competitive by the ultimate spiritual fiends.\n\nMeditation is supposed to be about self-awareness and inner peace. Hmmm, I’m not sure about that.\n\nSomeone at brunch casually mentions: “I’ve been meditating every morning. It’s really helped with my stress.” But, before they can take another sip of latte from their $3,000 coffee machine, someone jumps in.\n\nAditya: “Oh, I do 45 minutes of deep breathing at 3am.” Vanasri: “I did a ten day Vippassana course. No talking at all.” Satya: “Honestly, I no longer need food. I survive on prana alone!”\n\nWelcome to the mindfulness Olympics – where even detaching from worldly success has to be done better than everyone else!\n\nIn a world obsessed with showing off, being genuinely content with what you have is the greatest power move. Try it.\n\nMimi: “I just bought the new limited edition Rolex.” You: “Oh, nice. I don’t wear a watch anymore. I just go with the flow of time!”\n\nGame. Set. Match.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e929c30505b06c8df3593655e3acda7f8d540a3eed73f7d0edaa04686b8e54ce?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Varun initially pursued a career in architecture, earning a Bachelor’s degree from the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai and working as a freelance architect.\n\nWhile he designed buildings by day, his passion for cricket never faded. Originally a wicketkeeper-batsman, he took a bold leap at the age of 25, quitting his job to pursue cricket full-time.\n\nVarun joined CromBest Cricket Club as a seam-bowling all-rounder, but a knee injury forced him to change his game. Instead of giving up, he reinvented himself as a mystery spinner, a decision that would shape his future.\n\nHis breakthrough came during the 2017-18 season, when he claimed 31 wickets in seven games for Jubilee Cricket Club in a one-day tournament. He continued to fine-tune his bowling, developing a wide range of variations that baffled batsmen.\n\nHis performances in Tamil Nadu’s domestic circuit, especially in the 2018 Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), put him on the radar of Indian Premier League (IPL) scouts.\n\nPlaying a crucial role in Madurai’s title-winning campaign, Varun found himself bowling in the nets for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and soon, he got his first IPL contract.\n\nIn 2019, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) made a massive bid of Rs8.4 crore ($1.3 million) for Varun in the IPL auction. However, injuries and inconsistency limited his appearances.\n\nA career-defining moment arrived in 2020 when KKR acquired him, and he responded with a stellar season, picking up 17 wickets, including a five-wicket haul against Delhi Capitals.\n\nHis unique ability to deceive batsmen earned him a national call-up for India’s tour of Australia, though fitness issues delayed his international debut.\n\nVarun eventually made his T20I debut in July 2021 and, at 33 years old, became the second-oldest player after Farokh Engineer to make his one-day international (ODI) debut for India in February 2025.\n\nHis presence in Tamil Nadu’s domestic cricket and as KKR’s lead spinner in the IPL solidified his reputation as a key player.\n\nHis international career peaked at the recent ICC Champions Trophy, where he played a pivotal role in India’s title victory.\n\nHe emerged as one of the tournament’s most impactful bowlers, finishing as India’s second-highest wicket-taker. In six matches, he claimed nine wickets at an average of just 15.11, including a five-wicket haul.\n\nHis most crucial performance came in the final against New Zealand, where he dismantled the Kiwi batting lineup with two key wickets, helping India clinch their third Champions Trophy title.\n\nIndia had previously won in 2002 (joint winners) and 2013, while finishing runners-up in 2000 and 2017.\n\nVarun’s performances earned him a place in the 12-member “Team of the Tournament”, alongside teammates Shreyas Iyer, K.L. Rahul, Virat Kohli, Mohammed Shami, and Axar Patel as the 12th man, reported India Today.\n\nVarun is at the peak of his career, proving that late bloomers can thrive in cricket as well. With a Champions Trophy title under his belt, he is now looking forward to making a bigger impact in India’s limited-overs setup and continuing his stellar IPL performances.\n\nHis story is one of resilience, reinvention and relentless ambition – a true testament to the idea that it’s never too late to chase your dreams.\n\nDespite initial struggles with injuries and selection setbacks, Varun never gave up. His determination, coupled with his mystery spin, has earned him a place among India’s top spinners.\n\n“Varun did everything that was asked for. He’s got something different about him. And when he gets it right, he knocks people over, and he takes five wickets.”\n\nIndia’s captain Rohit Sharma", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/26a63628ee216799d0320a91119c5dff5e30eb93c67047a972eb5126d6a8b038?w=825", "alt_text": "Varun Chakravarthy bowling in the Champions Trophy match against New Zealand at the Dubai International Stadium on March."}]}

He immediately informed his friend and trip organiser, Mr Haresh Aswani, that he would have to forgo the getaway.\n\nMr Aswani, 63, the chief executive of Tolaram Group, quickly scrapped the three-day itinerary and replaced it with a temple tour, offering Mr Haridas a meaningful reason to join – to mourn his mother’s passing in the quiet of Bali’s sacred Hindu temples.\n\nHaving spent his childhood in Indonesia, Mr Aswani could traverse the island like the back of his hand. The other six friends embraced the revised plan immediately, realising that some time away from the hullabaloo of city life would be beneficial for all of them. Mr Aswani set one condition for the trip that everyone had to abide by – to convene for dinner every night, dressed in semi-formal at the very least. To him, these dinners were crucial in checking in on how everyone was feeling. All agreed, and so began the three-day trip to Bali.\n\nTheir temple tour started with Uluwatu, followed by Tanah Lot, and concluded with the most significant stop, Tirta Empul. Hinduism is widely practised in Bali, with the island being home to a population of over four million people and over 20,000 Hindu temples. While Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim nation, 87% of Balinese people identify as Hindu, making them the third-largest religious group in Indonesia after Islam and Christianity.\n\nOne of Bali’s busiest and most revered water temples, Tirta Empul holds deep significance for the island’s Hindu community. It was founded in 926 AD and has been actively used for worship and purification rituals ever since. Its name loosely translates to “water gushing from the Earth” in Balinese, earning its reputation as a holy spring. The temple’s pool is adorned with fourteen fountains, each believed to possess unique spiritual properties – ranging from health to love to prosperity. Devotees cleanse themselves in the pool, moving from one fountain to the next. The men joined a long line of worshippers, awaiting their turn.\n\nMr Haridas said: “When I finally submerged myself and let the water splash all over me, all the noise disappeared. I could feel my mother’s presence, it was transcendental.” Mr Aswani nodded in agreement, remarking that a silence fell over the group after the ritual. Unfortunately, he could not participate in the water ritual due to a foot injury but was an observer as his friends went through the process. “I noticed everyone became quiet, processing their emotions. In one way or another, we were all grappling with some form of hardship and needed this experience,” he reflected.\n\nWhen they gathered for the final dinner of the trip, emotions ran high.\n\n“We gave each other the space to express how deeply moved we were by the experience. In fact, from day one, everyone allowed each other the freedom to be themselves, whether that meant being quiet or talking about their feelings. It was surprising, considering we didn’t know each other well at all,” Mr Haridas said.\n\n“There was a magical synergy, like we had known each other for decades. A true brotherhood was born,” he added. “We were all essentially strangers before this trip. We have never even spent time together, let alone travelled together,” Mr Aswani, the only common link in the group, said.\n\nMr Haridas acknowledged that tension is often expected on trips with strangers, especially with people of their age group. “But there was nothing of the sort – status and ranks didn’t matter,” he said. With their bond strengthened through shared spirituality and mutual respect, the eight friends have remained in close contact since their trip to Bali in January. Mr Manoj Chaman Lal, 54, said the group is already planning their next trip, set for July, with Thailand and Italy on the shortlist.\n\nAs Mr Aswani put it: “It’s not just about the destination, it’s about the memories we create together, the conversations we have and most importantly, the laughs we share through it.”\n\n(Back row from left) Sonny Aswani, Haresh Aswani, Manoj Chaman Lal; (Front row from left) Mujeeb Rahmaan, Deepak Nanwani, Haridas Ramasamy, Elango Subramaniam, Ven Sreenivasan.\n\nPHOTO: HARESH ASWANI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a04d5338478e1766e257b38ef493342b4b8a830a13510952e1703787d56c9794?w=825", "alt_text": "A group of Singaporeans taking a holy dip in Tirta Empul, a temple in Indonesia."}]}

Don’t worry! Our weekly picks have you covered for the perfect unwind.\n\nDabba Cartel\n\nDabba Cartel is a Hindi-language web series that follows a group of women who run a small dabba (lunch-box) business with a narcotic twist. Their plans to establish a clandestine drug empire are hindered as they encounter both law enforcement and internal conflicts, all unfolding against the backdrop of metropolitan Mumbai.\n\nThe show features a pan-Indian ensemble cast, with renowned Hindi film actress Shabana Azmi portraying the cartel’s steely matriarch. She is joined by Jyotika, Shalini Pandey and Nimisha Sajayan – prominent actresses from the Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam film industries – alongside Anjali Anand, a well-known name in Hindi television.\n\nDrug-related crime dramas have consistently proven to be a hit on Netflix and Dabba Cartel is no exception. Released on Feb 28, it entered Netflix’s weekly global top 10 for non-English shows, with over 10 million hours viewed.\n\nThank You For Leaving\n\nRithvik Singh is an up-and-coming award-winning Indian poet with over half a million followers on Instagram (@wordsofrithvik). His latest book Thank You For Leaving is a collection of poems and short reflections catering to those who feel everything too deeply.\n\nPublished on Feb 14 by Ebury Press, the book is currently the bestseller in the Poetry category on Amazon India. Releasing the book on Valentine’s Day is ironic, given that its contents delve into the musings of a broken heart. In the preface, Rithvik likens the book to an ocean of emotions, one that will make you cry. The title currently has a 4.6 out of 5 rating on Amazon, with some readers praising how deeply it resonates with them.\n\nRun It Up\n\nKerala-born rapper Hanumankind dropped his latest track Run It Up on March 6, and it is buzzing across social media. In collaboration with producer Kalmi, the song blends Kerala’s traditional chenda drums with modern hip-hop production, merging his unapologetically Indian identity with global hip-hop appeal.\n\nThe highly anticipated music video, released a day later, amplifies its energy with imagery from Indian martial arts and rituals. The track is a personal manifesto, celebrating Hanumankind’s journey from Kerala to Houston and back to India. He redefines what it means to be a rapper from India, using his heritage as a foundation for universally relatable art.\n\nThe phrase “run it up,” which refers to making money, achieving success or building momentum, perfectly aligns with Hanumankind’s trajectory, building on the massive success of his breakout hit Big Dawgs, which came out last year and boasts over 392 million streams on Spotify.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fe106efe70c9c8506acded4279dd2c25ee4b116173b8311af001cd2bc66ff25b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nStudents from Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering gained valuable insights into India’s rapidly expanding space industry during an interaction with senior executives from IN-SPACe and private Indian space firms on Feb 28.\n\nThe Indian delegation, in Singapore to participate in the Global Space Technology Convention and Exhibition (GSTCE) at Marina Bay Sands, discussed a wide range of topics, including space policy, industry regulations, job opportunities and challenges in international collaboration.\n\nIN-SPACe, or the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre, is an autonomous agency under India’s Department of Space. It plays a crucial role in boosting private-sector participation in India’s space economy by supporting Non-Government Entities in the development of launch vehicles, satellites and space-based services.\n\nThe session at NTU featured presentations by IN-SPACe, GalaxEye and Skyserve, followed by a question and answer session where students actively engaged with the space industry leaders.\n\nThe event, which took place at NTU’s Satellite Research Centre (SaRC) and Conference Hall, was initiated by NTU’s Senior Lecturer Felix Lena Stephanie, deputy programme director of the MSc Project Management Programme, and received support from the High Commission of India.\n\n“The presentations were very comprehensive, covering not just technical aspects but also business models and unique opportunities in India’s space sector,” said Ms Stephanie.\n\nThe session, which attracted 45 students despite it being recess week, generated significant enthusiasm, with the young space enthusiasts expressing keen interest in potential careers in India’s space industry.\n\n“A Chinese student even asked if he could find work in India,” Ms Stephanie noted, emphasising the broad appeal of India’s advancements in space.\n\nFor the Indian students at NTU, the event was an eye-opener. “Many didn’t even know about the career opportunities available for them in India’s space sector,” she added.\n\nThis engagement follows an earlier educational tour to Bengaluru and Mysuru in January this year, when 19 NTU students and two faculty members – including Ms Stephanie – visited major institutes like the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), private space technology firms and SMEs to explore India’s growing space ecosystem.\n\n“It was a very insightful trip, allowing students to familiarise themselves with India’s space capabilities,” she said.\n\nThe ongoing exchanges between NTU and India’s space industry signal the possibility of deeper academic collaborations, including potential final-year project partnerships with Indian space firms. “This is not a one-off event. We are carefully thinking about how to sustain this engagement,” Ms Stephanie said.\n\nIN-SPACe representatives echoed this sentiment, expressing optimism about future academic and industrial partnerships between India and Singapore.\n\nIndia’s space programme, developed over six decades, is known for its application-driven approach that brings space-based services to everyday users.\n\nAt GSTCE 2024, the Indian delegation showcased the country’s growing private space industry.\n\nThe India Space Pavilion featured six Indian companies – Suhora, Ananth Technologies, GalaxEye, Skyserve, Hical Technologies and Manastu Space.\n\n“It was a great opportunity to network, and Indian firms look forward to exciting collaborations with global entities, including those from Singapore,” said Mr Partha Pratim, assistant director, Promotion Directorate at IN-SPACe.\n\nThe presentations were very comprehensive, covering not just technical aspects but also business models and unique opportunities in India’s space sector.\n\nNTU’s Senior Lecturer Felix Lena Stephanie", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e0ff0c3119a18d9b0542399f223917cbbd1bf7c4ac207a2b094a3ea854e4ff06?w=825", "alt_text": "NTU students and Indian space experts after their interaction on Feb 28."}]}

It is streaming on Netflix.\n\nTwo-time Oscar winner Guneet said in an Instagram post that celebrating independent cinema at the 97th Academy Awards is a testament to the idea that dreams do come true.\n\n“We attended the event with our short film Anuja, but this is just the beginning. As long as we continue to dream and create, we will return again soon,” she wrote.\n\nThe short film is produced in collaboration with the Salaam Baalak Trust, a non-profit founded by filmmaker Mira Nair’s family to support street and working children, Shine Global and Krushan Naik Films.\n\n“Anuja is a 22-minute love letter to girls who refuse to be defined by their circumstances, and it aligns perfectly with the vision and mission of the Salaam Baalak Trust, where our young lead, Sajda Pathan, resides,” Guneet said.\n\nShe also thanked the film’s cast and crew, including fellow executive producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas and producer Mindy Kaling, in her post.\n\n“Every effort made by our incredible team – Sajda Pathan, Ananya Shanbhag, Adam Graves, Suchitra Mattai, Mindy Kaling, Priyanka Chopra, Bela Bajaria, Monika Shergill and the entire Anuja family – has been worthwhile,” said Guneet. “I joined this project not only to support the filmmakers but also to amplify the resilience and voices of children. Skills, strength, and spirit – the girls have it all.\n\n“All hail independent cinema! Independent storytellers hold the truth, and we must continue to champion them. I am deeply grateful to the Academy for bringing Anuja to a global stage. As Producer Samantha Quan said: “To all the dreamers and young filmmakers – tell the stories that move you.

The deep chocolate brown hue exuded sophistication, seamlessly blending Indian heritage with modern fashion trends. She accessorised the look with uncut polki earrings and matching trench coat buttons, all from Manish Malhotra High Jewellery.\n\n“We attended the event with our short film Anuja, but this is just the beginning.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe historical narratives about Tamil Nadu are a beautiful blend of literature, politics and cultural life, which are integral to understanding its identity. But often overlooked by most writers is a description of the land, who the people were and how they lived.\n\nNoted Indian journalist Nirmala Lakshman’s new book The Tamils, A Portrait of a Community, takes a chronological approach to the antiquity of the Tamil culture. But it does not focus on the wars and conquests. It takes points from new excavations and her own research to portray a community who have preserved a distinct cultural heritage while evolving across time and geographies.\n\n“As you know, there is a lot that is lost in myth and legend,” Ms Nirmala, who is the publisher and chairperson of The Hindu Group of Publications, told tabla! “It is difficult to verify all the details down the ages. The early communities may not have even spoken Tamil. So, I took a realistic time frame to do my research – from 4,000 years before Christ right up to the present.\n\n“This book is about ordinary people and their sentiments. It looks at how Tamil culture has endured even as it has evolved and mutated over centuries.”\n\nA people of immense resilience, intellect and creativity, the 90 million Tamils continue to leave an indelible mark on the world. Their origins are from today’s Tamil Nadu, which largely corresponds to ancient Tamilakam and is bound by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, with tracts of dry red earth, green paddy fields and pebbled riverbeds in between.\n\nThe Tamils, A Portrait of a Community, traces the remarkable journey of the people of this land, highlighting the influential role of dynasties like the Pallavas, Pandyas, Cholas and Cheras and the thriving Jain community of that time.\n\nIt also examines the evolution and spread of Tamil culture through the centuries, the coming of the British,  the freedom struggle and the Non-Brahmin movement, before describing the distinctive attributes of the Tamils in the modern era, especially the changes that are taking place in the 21st century.\n\n“To do this book which covers different ages, I knew I didn’t have a historian’s depth of knowledge to pick and choose subjects,” said Ms Nirmala, who was previously the joint editor of The Hindu newspaper. “So, after consultation with my publisher David Davidar, I did what a  journalist does best  – provide a flowing narrative. The Tamil communities are vast and enriching. So I went with verifiable details of the antiquity of the Tamil culture, and bring it up to the present day.”\n\nIncluding the Covid years, it took Ms Nirmala about four and a half years to produce the book.\n\n“Initially, when David broached the subject, I realised I knew very little about the Tamils, though I’m of Tamil origin,” said Ms Nirmala. “A retired colleague, who has a passion for ancient Tamil history, introduced me to a host of Tamil epigraphists and historians. So I started by actually meeting them and doing site visits. Alongside, I did a lot of reading.”\n\nTo the ordinary reader, the book is appealing, because it’s not very academic. But one drawback is that it doesn’t look at the Tamil diaspora, especially how the Tamils, who number about 400,000 now, arrived in Singapore.\n\nTamils mostly live in South India, but can be found in almost all countries – especially in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n“This is a very big miss in the book,” admitted Ms Nirmala. “I’m hoping I will have the opportunity to write about the overseas Tamils, because I think they have contributed greatly to their own societies.\n\n“Tamils in Singapore have done a lot for Singapore society. They have served all aspects. It’s  also interesting that they have retained some aspects of Tamil culture, and adapted themselves to the local environment.\n\n“The diaspora aspect deserves a whole book on its own.”\n\nThe Tamils: A Portrait of a Community.\n\nPhotos: @nirmalalakshman/ Instagram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/02993aadf56f5726d7935cb7db517eedd759e522c4197a69c26aab95506d0161?w=825", "alt_text": "Nirmala Lakshman."}]}

The workers were building a highway near Mana village, in Chamoli, near the northern border with China.\n\nTwo avalanches hit the camp within five minutes, hurtling eight containers and a shed down the mountain on Friday.\n\nDespite the force of the blow, the containers retained enough oxygen to keep the workers alive for nearly 60 hours in below-freezing temperatures before they were saved on Sunday.\n\n“The metal shelters saved most of them,” a senior rescue official told The Times of India. “They had just enough oxygen to hold on until we got them out.”\n\nIt took roughly 250 army and border police personnel, stationed nearby, to dig the workers out of the snow.\n\nThe army used a drone-based detection system and a rescue dog to assist in its search operations.\n\nPhotos from the scene show rescue teams using ice picks, shovels and a digger to uncover the trapped men.\n\nOthers show them carrying stretchers through a blizzard.\n\nMany of the rescued workers are receiving treatment at hospitals in the state’s Joshimath town and Rishikesh city.\n\nMr Satyaprakash Yadav, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh who was among those rescued, said the “avalanche hit our container like a landslide”, according to a video released by the army.\n\n“The container I was in broke apart when the snow hit, and it ended up near a river,” he said.\n\n“We managed to get out on our own and reached a nearby army guest house, where we stayed overnight,” he added.\n\nMr Rajnish Kumar, a worker from Uttarkhand’s Pithoragarh town, said most of them were sleeping when the avalanche struck.\n\n“When the snow hit the container, it sank about 60 metres down the mountain. The Army arrived quickly and rescued us,” he said.\n\nHis colleague Vipan Kumar thought “this was the end” when he found himself unable to move as he struggled for air under the thick layer of snow.\n\n“I heard a loud roar, like thunder… before I could react, everything went dark,” he told the Times of India.\n\nAvalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season.\n\nMana lies at an altitude of more than 3,200 metres. The minimum temperature in the area was down to -12 deg C last weekend.\n\nMr Dhan Singh Bisht said his son and nephew were alive only because of the prompt action by the relief teams.\n\n“I am grateful to them,” he said.\n\nAmong the dead was Mr Anil Kumar, a 23-year-old who joined the construction team as a chef in October.\n\nHe had been due to return home on March 1, after postponing the trip on Feb 22.\n\n“We video called him on February 27 and he complained about the weather,” his father Ishwari Prasad told The Indian Express.\n\nThat was a day before the avalanche. Initially, the family was told Mr Kumar was alive in hospital. In reality, he was dead and had been mixed up with someone else.\n\n“He was supposed to be home,” his father said. “If only he had come.”\n\n“The avalanche hit our container like a landslide. The container I was in broke apart when the snow hit, and it ended up near a river.

She also appeared in the Tamil film Wagah (2016) opposite Vikram Prabhu and in the Kannada comedy Pataki (2017), where she portrays a journalist.\n\nThe case has taken a political turn due to her connection to DGP Rao, who heads the Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation.\n\nThe senior police officer re-married after his first wife died. His second wife has two daughters from her first marriage, of whom Ranya is one.\n\nThe officer has distanced himself from the case, stating that he was unaware of Ranya’s activities and learnt about her arrest through the media.\n\n“She got married four months ago and hasn’t visited us since,” he told the Times of India. “We are unaware of her or her husband’s business dealings.\n\n“This has come as a huge shock and disappointment. The law will take its course.”\n\nMeanwhile, investigators are looking into possible police links that may have helped Ranya bypass security and are working to determine whether she was acting alone or as part of a larger smuggling network.\n\n“She got married four months ago and hasn’t visited us since.

It is likely to be auctioned soon.\n\nDushyant and his wife Abhirami, partners in Easan Productions, borrowed the money to produce a film named Jegajala Killadi starring Vishnu Vishal and Nivetha Pethuraj.

The Hyderabad cybercrime police are currently investigating.\n\n• Game Changer, featuring Ram Charan, was illegally broadcast on an Andhra Pradesh cable network. Authorities swiftly acted, arresting those responsible and seizing the broadcasting equipment.\n\n• Ajayante Randam Moshanam, a Malayalam film starring Tovino Thomas, was leaked online, prompting the director to file a police report in Kerala.\n\n• Other recent victims of piracy include Dragon, Laila, Brahma Anandam, and Thandel, all of which were leaked within days of release.\n\nPiracy has plagued the Indian film industry for decades. In Tamil Nadu, the government invoked the Goondas Act in 2006 to curb the issue, leading to temporary crackdowns on DVD parlours selling pirated films.\n\nHowever, enforcement challenges have allowed illegal activities to persist. Cities like Chennai, Madurai, and Puducherry remain hotspots for pirated DVDs and online leaks.\n\nOther southern states, including Kerala and Karnataka, have also struggled with piracy. According to Mr H.D. Gangaraju, former president of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, nearly 80 per cent of Kannada producers face financial difficulties due to piracy.\n\nExperts warn that piracy continues to drain the entertainment industry’s revenue, despite various measures taken over the years.\n\nMr Mukul Shrivastava, partner at EY Forensic and Integrity Services, said that anti-piracy measures remain “insufficient and fragmented,” urging stronger industry collaboration and government intervention.\n\nMr Rohit Jain, chairman of the Digital Entertainment Committee at the Internet and Mobile Association of India, emphasised that India’s digital entertainment sector – expected to reach Rs 1.46 billion by 2026 – is at risk if piracy is not curbed.\n\n“It is imperative for all stakeholders – government bodies, industry players and consumers – to unite in combating this issue,” he said.\n\nSouth Indian filmmakers are stepping up legal actions against piracy, deploying advanced technology like digital watermarking and encryption to track illegal distribution. However, experts stress that law enforcement must do more to tackle organised piracy networks.\n\nWith the film industry contributing significantly to India’s economy, stakeholders are calling for stricter regulations, stronger enforcement and collective action to safeguard the future of Indian cinema.\n\nAllu Arjun’s Pushpa: The Rule was leaked online a few days after the movie was released in theatres.\n\nPhoto: Instagram", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/80587878b24847a638783e8190a56ff2ff6b1bf195aefd4f7ab184ff5ccd3be0?w=825", "alt_text": "Allu Arjun’s Pushpa: The Rule was leaked online a few days after the movie was released in theatres."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA thrilling cricket showdown awaits as India and New Zealand gear up to play in the Champions Trophy 2025 final on Sunday in Dubai.\n\nThis marks the first time in 25 years that the two teams will meet in a white-ball ICC tournament final, with their last encounter dating back to the 2000 ICC Knockout Trophy, where New Zealand defeated India by four wickets to claim their maiden ICC title.\n\nBoth teams have taken contrasting paths to the final. India, led by Rohit Sharma, secured their place with a hard-fought four-wicket win over Australia in the semi-final, maintaining an undefeated streak in the tournament.\n\nNew Zealand overpowered South Africa in the second semi-final in Lahore, showcasing their adaptability and hunger for a world title. The Black Caps, who lost to India in the group stage, will now have a chance to avenge that defeat and lift their first white-ball ICC trophy since 2000.\n\nIndia comes into the final as the tournament’s most complete team, boasting a deep batting lineup and a well-rounded bowling attack. Their dominance on Dubai’s dry pitches has been evident, particularly with their spin-heavy approach.\n\nKuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Varun Chakravarthy have all played crucial roles, suffocating opposition batting lineups with their precision and variation.\n\nIn their group-stage win over New Zealand, Chakravarthy was the outstanding performer, taking five wickets and exposing the Kiwis’ struggles against quality spin. With Shreyas Iyer scoring 79 runs, India managed to defend a total of 249 with ease, bowling out New Zealand for 205.\n\nBatting remains India’s biggest strength, with Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill and Iyer anchoring the top order. The presence of power-hitters like Hardik Pandya and Patel adds depth to their middle order, allowing for aggressive finishes in crucial moments.\n\nGiven their dominance on slow pitches, India will likely stick to their spin-heavy strategy, which has proven effective throughout the tournament.\n\nDespite their group-stage loss to India, New Zealand has gained momentum heading into the final, especially after their commanding semi-final win over South Africa.\n\nRachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson starred with centuries, while the bowlers, led by captain Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips, ensured a comfortable victory.\n\nNew Zealand’s biggest advantage in the final will be their familiarity with Dubai’s conditions, having played there in the group-stage match.\n\nThe pitch, where India recently beat Pakistan, is expected to assist spinners, which could give both teams an equal chance to capitalise on the conditions.\n\nThe Kiwis’ batting line-up has shown resilience, with Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell and Phillips providing stability in the middle order. Their ability to handle spin better than most teams could prove decisive against India’s dominant bowling attack.\n\nMoreover, their tall pace attack, capable of extracting bounce and movement, remains a key factor.\n\nIndia’s top order has struggled against high-quality swing and seam bowling in recent ICC tournaments, which gives New Zealand an opportunity to exploit early vulnerabilities. In the group-stage match, the Kiwi pacers troubled the Indian openers with lateral movement, something they will look to replicate in the final.\n\nOne area where New Zealand consistently outshines most teams is fielding. Their ability to cut off singles, save boundaries, and convert half-chances into wickets could prove crucial in a tight contest.\n\nNew Zealand’s batters have struggled against spin, particularly in the group-stage match against India, where Chakravarthy wreaked havoc. If India’s spinners can apply similar pressure, New Zealand will need a solid plan to counter their threat.\n\nIndia enters the final as the favourites, given their dominant form, balanced squad and past success over New Zealand in this tournament.\n\nHowever, New Zealand is a team that thrives under pressure, as seen in past ICC tournaments. With their well-rounded attack, strong fielding and adaptability, they will fancy their chances of an upset.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/659de111fe1118f6cdce7557a286405d9d3e8be535f89df857bf3ab56218baba?w=825", "alt_text": "Varun Chakravarthy celebrates after his five-wicket haul against New Zealand on March 2 in Dubai."}]}

I stopped by a streetside eating place in the Tollygunge area of the city’s south. The stall is run by Gourhori and Taposhi Das, a couple whose ancestral home lies in the Midnapore area of West Bengal.\n\nFor Rs65, a single Singapore dollar, I got to eat the Bengali rice-and-lentils preparation called khichuri, aloo bhaja (chopped potatoes fried to crispy perfection) and rui fish curry. The point was not the price (which was affordable, to say the least) nor even the food (which was delicious). The point was the way in which it was served.\n\nThe khichuri and aloo bhaja arrived on a piece of brown paper designed as talpata (thatch), which was placed on an aluminum tray (along with the fish curry in a stainless-steel bowl). Since I could have eaten out of the tray, why the vicarious need for talpata, I wondered.\n\nThe reason: Aluminum is universal and therefore anonymous. Talpata is local and therefore personal. Culture means preferring the personal over the anonymous. While I take delight in the multitude of cuisines that the world offers, Bengali food is the preferred diet of my soul.\n\nAnd the soul takes delight in the presence of the inherited and the familiar. Talpata provides visual reassurance of the continuity of Bengali culture. The finest porcelain plates, even if they are embossed with official or corporate insignia, do not match up to the raw joy of sitting on the ground, in the home of forefathers and foremothers, and eating from whatever the plate might be made of.\n\nTalpata is a metaphor of the ecological plenitude of Indian and Bangladeshi civilisations, the leaf signifying nature’s capacity to fulfil the needs of those born and those yet to be born.\n\nTo a child, food is nothing if it is not served by her grandmother, mother, aunt or elder sister. Men know how to eat: Women know how to feed.\n\nTaposhi, the garrulous matriarch of the establishment, made certain of that distinction. Everyone who ate at the establishment was personal to her. A young woman who arrived was asked: “Ma, what would you like today?” Ma (mother) is the procreative womanhood that parents confer on daughters, those mothers-to-be. (Taposhi and Gourhari have two loving sons but miss the daughter they never had.) The girl-as-customer therefore became a part of Taposhi’s vicariously extended biological family, and was treated likewise.\n\nShe responded with a beaming smile, calling the matriarch Mashi (aunt). A young man was asked indulgently: “Do you want some more mixed-vegetable tarkari? (At the same price). I was not even asked. Gourhari simply added more mixed tarkari to my emptying talpata.\n\nIn front of my astonished eyes, unaccustomed to witnessing Indian civilisation change from year to year – I have been away for four decades now – I saw a Bengali culture that had been transformed from a natural talpata to a paper one. But what had not been transformed was the maternal provenance of Bengal.\n\nIt existed in the interstices of the relationship between the past and the present. It flourished in a makeshift stall next to an avenue on which plied hundreds of buses and cars, who knows where they came from and where they were headed. All of them belonged to passing chance: The stall was a sanctuary of destiny.\n\nI asked Taposhi what sustained her delight in being a part of the life of others. She said: “It is very easy to lose respect. It is very difficult to gain respect. Every time a customer returns to my stall, she – like that girl eating there who just called me Mashi– returns to the sound of my words and the shape of my smile. That is why my customers respect me. I shall not lose their respect by forgetting how to keep making them my own.”\n\nI know that these words sound forced and perhaps even corny in translation, but in Bengali, Taposhi’s reply possesses the natural energy and eager flow of a river that travels through the land of the unknown, contouring the lives and thoughts of humans but without asking for anything in return. What can a human give a river?\n\nBengal is a mother, or she is nothing.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/155f85bc463c0a47ddabe34bbfa910762c84885cc735ab543b493b9be3ddbf15?w=825", "alt_text": "Gourhari and Taposhi Das."}]}

On the school front, he said the dropout rate can be further reduced.\n\n“We can do better because one in five is still too much, but it isn’t four in 10,” Mr Shanmugam said.\n\nIn his speech, Sinda chief executive Anbarasu Rajendran said the organisation helped nearly 31,500 individuals in 2024 through a wide range of programmes.\n\nHe said this was possible with the support of 578 partners, including corporates, and more than 400 volunteers.\n\nMr Anbarasu added that Sinda received $1.7 million in donations in 2024.\n\nThe achievements of the Indian community were highlighted by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during a dialogue with Indian youth on April 13.\n\nHe noted that Indians in Singapore have made outsized contributions to the country in many areas, including in business, industry and the Government.\n\n“You may be a small community but, certainly, your contributions to Singapore and the impact that you have on Singapore are not small at all,” said PM Wong.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2d147383b3bb0b8e809b3f1cd2e877f331a538e6e25654c3fd966fbd9db5e4ad?w=825", "alt_text": "A dance performance at the Sinda appreciation ceremony on April 19, 2025."}]}

Setting the adaptation within the frame of a present-day writer during the isolating period of the pandemic allowed us to draw parallels between past and present – between physical confinement and emotional introspection. It was less about updating Tagore and more about holding a mirror up to our own time,” Ms Gauri said.\n\nRehearsals for the play spanned over three months, allowing the actors to not only understand their characters deeply but also to navigate the subtle transitions between the period setting and the contemporary frame.\n\nIn Singapore, a multilingual society, plays like Charulata is a boon for diaspora audiences.\n\nAt the heart of this production is a quiet insistence that there is space – urgent, necessary space – for South Asian narratives told in the languages of their origins.\n\n“There’s a deep, often underserved audience for stories like these,” said Ms Gauri, whose vision guided the adaptation.\n\n“Productions like Charulata remind us of the power of hearing stories in the languages they were originally conceived in.”\n\nSet across two timelines – colonial Bengal and a contemporary Singaporean metropolis – the play drew poignant parallels between the two. Both women grappled with a hunger for connection, creative expression and the need to be truly seen in a world that constantly diminishes them.\n\nWhat truly elevated the production was its use of music. Carefully curated strains of Rabindra Sangeet – Tagore’s signature compositions – floated through the performance, sometimes in haunting instrumental form, other times translated delicately into Hindi.\n\nThese musical interludes served as both bridge and balm, linking eras and emotions.\n\nOf course, adapting Tagore is no small feat. “His prose is layered and poetic,” the director said.\n\n“The biggest challenge was honouring the original while making it accessible and meaningful to a contemporary audience.”\n\nAs the final notes of Rabindra Sangeet faded into silence and the lights dimmed on Charulata’s world, the audience broke into roaring applause.\n\nAs Ms Gauri reflected on the reception to the play, she said” “One audience member shared that they saw their own mother in Charulata while another said the modern-day writer’s arc reflected their personal experience during lockdown. These responses affirmed that the play was not just watched, but truly felt.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3f1d9246fc7d7c004d965fe62eac780f4f2a5066afc205a976a31407af6d0727?w=825", "alt_text": "A scene from the play Charulata."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn an extraordinary celebration of talent, resilience and inclusion, children with disabilities from India and Singapore performed together for the first time at Empowering with Love – a heartwarming cultural showcase on April 19 at the Quantum Arena, One World International School, Punggol.\n\nOrganised by the Different Art Centre (DAC) in Thiruvananthapuram and the Singapore Malayalee Association (SMA), the three-hour spectacle featured breathtaking performances in magic, music, dance and visual arts.\n\nThe event drew emotional applause from the audience, as children from the two nations bridged cultural boundaries through the universal language of art.\n\nHelmed by celebrated magician and disability rights advocate Gopinath Muthukad, the show embodied DAC’s mission: transforming the lives of differently-abled children through the arts. “Our goal is to spread this model worldwide,” Mr Muthukad said. “What began in Kerala can inspire change everywhere.”\n\nAmong the 30 performers were 15 children from DAC and several Singapore-based children, including Samuel Lee, who showcased his dance and magic skills.\n\nFor many, this was their first time on stage. Their weeks of training culminated in a spirited display that touched hearts and earned standing ovations.\n\nMr Vincent Lee, the father of Samuel who has Down Syndrome, said. “It was magical. It’s the first time Samuel did magic on stage. We felt like one family – no race, no language barrier, just love.”\n\nThe show’s emotional core resonated with parents like Mr Rajesh Rajendran, whose 16-year-old daughter Malavika has autism. “She often says she has no friends. This platform gave her confidence and connection. It was priceless,” he said.\n\nDAC has long championed this approach. Today, the centre provides therapy, vocational training and international performance opportunities to over 150 children.\n\nHis dream: to build the International Institute for People with Disabilities in Kasaragod by 2029, which he envisions as the largest and most inclusive centre of its kind globally.\n\nThe Singapore showcase also featured a rare cross-cultural exchange. “These children are not just performing; they are learning about timing, coordination, and self-expression,” said special needs educator Joyce Ho. “In six weeks, we saw incredible transformation.”\n\nPlans are already afoot to replicate the DAC model in Singapore, a move SMA and Mr Muthukad say will revolutionise special needs education here. “It’s not just the children who grow – it’s society. We need to evolve to embrace every ability,” said Mr Mohan Kumar, DAC’s global ambassador.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2697ba0a58a2603fbfb34c1cc358427dc4d2aa36032b351444ebf9e6278d1c71?w=825", "alt_text": "Differently-abled children from Singapore who took part in the event."}]}

There were also about 300 local transport providers.\n\nEyewitnesses say the attackers appeared to deliberately target Hindu men, asking victims to recite Islamic verses before executing them point-blank.\n\nAmong the dead: a newlywed Indian naval officer on honeymoon, a pony ride operator trying to defend tourists, and families celebrating vacations that turned into nightmares.\n\nThe attack was claimed by a shadowy outfit called Kashmir Resistance, widely believed to be a front for Pakistan-based groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba – though Islamabad has denied any link, reported the BBC.\n\nThe massacre began in broad daylight, with militants fanning out across three locations in Baisaran, firing over 60 rounds.\n\nSurvivors say the attackers spared women and children, instead demanding men identify themselves and recite Islamic verses.\n\nOne woman, Ms Himanshi, watched her husband – naval officer Vinay Narwal – gunned down after he admitted he was not Muslim. The couple had married just days earlier.\n\n“He was the best man,” she wept, as she bid farewell to his tricolour-draped coffin, reported NDTV.\n\nAnother victim, businessman Santosh Jagdale, was executed alongside his brother-in-law after failing to recite religious scripture. “They shot my father in the head, behind the ear, and in the back,” said his daughter Asavari, who hid in a tent.\n\nTeacher Debasish Bhattacharyya only survived by repeating Islamic verses he had learnt growing up in a Muslim neighbourhood. “It was probably the only way to survive,” he said.\n\nKashmir ground to a halt on Wednesday as grief turned to fury. Shops and schools closed, while slogans like “Tourists are our lives” echoed through protest marches.\n\nJammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited families of victims, confirming that one local, pony operator Adil Shah, had died while trying to stop the attackers. “He displayed immense bravery,” Mr Abdullah said.\n\nIn Pahalgam, once abuzz with tourists, an eerie silence now reigns. Airlines operated emergency flights as shaken visitors fled, reported The Times of India.\n\nThe political fallout has been swift and severe. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short a foreign tour to hold emergency meetings.\n\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh warned: “Those behind this will hear our response – loud and clear.”\n\nIndia has stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan but has downgraded diplomatic ties.\n\nMeasures announced include: Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty – a crucial water-sharing pact; closure of the only open land border crossing; expulsion of Pakistani defence advisers and reduction of embassy staff; cancellation of special visas for Pakistanis, with a 48-hour deadline to leave India.\n\n“India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed or enabled terror,” said Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.\n\nPakistan’s Foreign Ministry expressed concern but denied involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a high-level national security meeting in response, reported Reuters.\n\nThe attack, which left 17 others injured and killed one Nepali citizen, is being described as the deadliest assault on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\nIts symbolism is potent – targeting civilians in one of Kashmir’s most popular tourist hubs, and shattering the Modi government’s narrative of restored peace since revoking the region’s special status in 2019.\n\nIndia now faces tough choices. A cross-border strike, as seen in past retaliations, could escalate tensions between two nuclear-armed nations.\n\nYet public anger and political pressure are surging.\n\nFamilies are reeling. Ms Priyadarshini, whose husband Prashant Satpathy was shot in front of their nine-year-old son, described the moment of horror: “He had just finished a zipline ride. A bullet hit him in the head. He collapsed before my eyes.”\n\nMr J.S. Chandramouli, a retired banker, was found dead hours later, separated from his family. Ms Pallavi, whose husband was also killed, said the attacker told her, “Go tell Modi,” after sparing her life.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the deaths of three cousins – Atul Mone, Sanjay Lele and Hemant Joshi – have left a family shattered.\n\nMr Hawa Singh Narwal, grandfather of slain naval officer Vinay, said: “I am full of rage and grief. If this doesn’t stop, tomorrow someone else will lose their child.”\n\nSecurity forces have launched a massive manhunt. Sketches of three suspects have been released, and forested areas near Pahalgam are being combed.\n\nBut for the people of Kashmir – especially those whose livelihoods depend on tourism – the fear is palpable.\n\n“This is an attack on all of us,” said protester Imran Khan in Srinagar. “Tourists are our hope, our lifeline.”\n\nNewlywed Lieutenant Vinay Narwal, 26, from Karnal, Haryana, was on his honeymoon with his wife, Himanshi Narwal, when he was killed in the militant attack.\n\n“I am full of rage and grief.

Santosh Kumar\n\nKarun Nair sent out this plea on social media in December 2022, his career seemingly slipping through the cracks: “Dear cricket, give me one more chance.”\n\nOnce celebrated for his historic Test triple-century – only the second by an Indian – Karun had by then faded into obscurity. Dropped by Karnataka and overlooked for selection, he found himself cast adrift at just 31.\n\nFast forward to April 13, 2025: Karun, donning Delhi Capitals colours, walked out as an Impact Player against Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nChasing 206, he smashed a breathtaking 89 off 40 balls – his first IPL half-century in seven years, and a resounding reply to anyone who thought his story was over.\n\nThat innings was more than just runs. It was a statement. It was redemption. It was the reward for nearly three years of relentless domestic dominance – over 3,000 runs, 12 centuries across formats, a Vijay Hazare Trophy final, a Ranji Trophy win with Vidarbha, and outstanding stints with Northamptonshire in English county cricket.\n\nFor those unaware of his journey post-India exit, Karun had become a domestic colossus.\n\nHe moved from Karnataka to Vidarbha for better opportunities and exploded with form – 863 runs in the Ranji Trophy, including four centuries, and a jaw-dropping Vijay Hazare campaign where he amassed 779 runs at an average of 389.50. He also dazzled in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and continued scoring in England.\n\nDespite this, Karun was left out of India’s Champions Trophy squad earlier this year. That stung.\n\nAccording to Vidarbha head coach Usman Ghani, the snub left him “a bit upset” – until a calming chat with cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar refocused his mind.\n\n“He regrouped and performed again. You could see the hunger in his eyes,” Ghani recalled.\n\nKarun’s IPL 2025 return couldn’t have been more cinematic. Facing Jasprit Bumrah – arguably the best white-ball bowler in the world – he unleashed a fearless assault.\n\nHe smashed two boundaries off Bumrah’s first over, then took him for 18 runs with audacious sixes and crisp timing. Tempers flared between the two after a mid-pitch collision, but the tension was later defused with a sportsmanlike hug, captured in a viral video.\n\nThough Delhi Capitals fell short by 12 runs, Karun’s effort was the highlight of the match. Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali hailed his strokeplay, saying, “No one – not Kohli, not Rohit, not Buttler – has played Bumrah like that in the last five years. Karun Nair is a very big player.”\n\nYet, Karun is not one to rest on one good knock. Speaking after his return, he said the key was belief: “I trusted my instincts more than ever. It was about going out, playing each ball, and expressing myself freely.”\n\nDespite a duck in the following game, the IPL spotlight is firmly back on him. And so is national attention.\n\nWith a five-Test India tour of England coming up – and Karun armed with two county stints and blistering domestic form – the timing seems perfect for a recall.\n\n“He fits all formats. His preparation is meticulous. His fitness, game awareness and mental toughness are at an all-time high,” Ghani asserted.\n\nVidarbha captain Akshay Wadkar echoed this, calling Karun “an intelligent player who adapts to every situation”.\n\nNow 33, Karun knows that opportunities at the international level may be scarce. But his resurgence is proof that talent, when backed by grit and consistency, cannot be ignored forever.\n\nFor a man once discarded despite a 303 not out, this IPL season might just be the beginning of Karun’s second coming — and maybe, just maybe, that one more chance from cricket has arrived.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a7e584c67f6873574d9279688ba1ec80938c14a96d0b3a856de8f5f3af7ec222?w=825", "alt_text": "Karun Nair."}]}

I will marry him and start my life anew.”\n\nHer words sent shockwaves through her family, who say they want nothing more to do with her.\n\nMs Shivani and Mr Rahul’s wedding was set for April 16, reported India Today. Preparations were in full swing when Mr Rahul, under the pretext of going shopping for his wedding clothes, walked out of his house and never came back. Around the same time, Ms Sapna also went missing from her home.\n\nThe disappearance initially left families confused. It wasn’t until Ms Shivani’s father, Mr Jitendra Kumar, pieced together Ms Sapna’s frequent phone conversations with Mr Rahul – allegedly lasting up to 20 hours a day – that suspicion turned to reality.\n\nA missing persons report was filed, and soon, the village was buzzing with disbelief: the mother had run away with her daughter’s fiance.\n\n“I live in Bengaluru for work and had returned home recently. I started noticing their closeness, but I never imagined this,” Mr Jitendra told police.\n\nAccording to Mr Rahul’s statement to police, Ms Sapna emotionally blackmailed him into eloping.\n\n“She told me that if I didn’t meet her at the Aligarh bus stop, she’d end her life,” he claimed.\n\nThe couple first travelled to Kasganj, then Bareilly, followed by Muzaffarpur in Bihar. Realising their story had gone viral and the police were on their trail, they fled toward the Nepal border but ultimately returned.\n\n“We got scared. When we saw that the police were everywhere, we decided to come back,” Mr Rahul said. He claimed Ms Sapna had been mistreated at home, both by her husband and in-laws.\n\nStill, when asked if he planned to marry the older woman, Mr Rahul hesitated. “There’s nothing like that,” he said at first. After a pause, he added, “Will do.”\n\nMs Shivani has been left humiliated and heartbroken by the developments, noted the Times of India.\n\nThe man she was preparing to marry vanished with her mother. To make matters worse, she accused Ms Sapna of stealing Rs3.5 lakh ($5,375) in cash and jewellery worth over Rs5 lakh from the family home before fleeing.\n\nMs Sapna denied the accusation. “I had only Rs200 and a mobile phone with me,” she claimed. Her in-laws are not buying it.\n\n“She’s dead to us,” said Mr Dinesh Kumar, Ms Sapna’s brother-in-law. “She betrayed not just her daughter but the entire family. We want the money and jewellery back – she shouldn’t be allowed to walk away from this.”\n\nMr Dinesh also dismissed Ms Sapna’s allegations of abuse by her husband. “I’ve stayed at their house for months.

It proposes sweeping changes to the management of religious land in India, particularly Waqf properties traditionally used by the Muslim community.\n\nCritics say the law undermines Muslim institutions, while the BJP defends it as a “pro-Muslim reform.”\n\nProtesters, angered over what they claim is discriminatory legislation, clashed with police, vandalised property, torched shops and attacked homes.\n\nInternet services were suspended in affected areas, and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs deployed nine companies (about 900 personnel) of the Border Security Force (BSF) to help restore order. Over 150 individuals have been arrested.\n\nThe National Commission for Women (NCW) announced the formation of an inquiry committee to investigate reports of women being assaulted during the violence.\n\nChairperson Vijaya Rahatkar is expected to visit the region, particularly Mandirpara in Dhulian, where disturbing reports of molestation and mass displacement have emerged.\n\n“The violence has led to the exodus of hundreds of women who had to cross the Bhagirathi River for safety,” said the NCW in a statement. “These women are now refugees in their own state, facing trauma and loss.”\n\nChief Minister Mamata Banerjee has fiercely criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party, BSF and central government agencies, accusing them of facilitating the violence to polarise communities before the upcoming elections.\n\nMs Banerjee labelled the unrest “pre-planned,” blaming cross-border infiltration allegedly abetted by BSF personnel.\n\n“Guarding the border is the job of the Centre. The BSF is under the Ministry of Home Affairs. They can’t evade responsibility,” she said.\n\nThe BJP, in turn, accused the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of appeasing minority voters, further fuelling the political divide.\n\nOn the ground, the human toll is becoming more visible with each passing day.\n\nA woman who lost both her husband and son during the violence recounted the horror: “They pelted stones, broke down our doors, and attacked us. My family is gone.” The assailants reportedly wore masks.\n\nSenior police officials say the situation in Murshidabad is now under control.\n\nSaid Additional Director-General of Police (South Bengal) Supratim Sarkar: “We have opened a 24-hour control room.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMore than 1,000 Singaporean food lovers and guests got a taste of India’s eastern heritage at the vibrant Odisha Food Festival from April 10 to 12 at the One World International School in Punggol.\n\nSpearheaded by two expert chefs – Sambit Suman from the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar, and Bijay Pradhan from the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation’s Nimantran Restaurant in Bhubaneswar – the festival featured an exquisite array of Odia delicacies.\n\nFrom humble, nutritious vegetarian stews to richly spiced seafood and meat dishes, the culinary experience showcased the diversity and depth of Odisha’s cuisine. The event was hosted by the High Commission of India in Singapore, in collaboration with Odisha Tourism, the Odia Society Singapore and Global Schools Foundation.\n\nThe main highlight was a grand luncheon on April 12, where representatives from the Singapore government, media, academia and business and cultural sectors enjoyed an authentic Odia spread.\n\nThe dishes included classics like Chunka Dahi Pakhala (fermented rice with curd), vegetable Besara in mustard paste, Chingudi Jholo (prawn curry), Kukuda Mansa Kasa (slow-cooked chicken in Oriya spices) and the signature dessert Khiri, a fragrant rice pudding with cashews and raisins.\n\nA cooking workshop on April 10 offered participants a hands-on experience with traditional recipes, led by the visiting chefs, and provided insights into the simplicity and nutritional values of Odia cooking.\n\nOdia food’s signature lies in its light use of oil and spices so as not to subdue the natural flavours.\n\nAs celebrity chef Sarab Kapoor noted: “Every bite felt like soul food – subtle, flavourful and deeply comforting.”\n\nDishes like Santula (vegetable stew) and Dalma (a wholesome lentil and veggie preparation) proved popular among health-conscious Singaporeans.\n\nThe festival also aimed to enhance cultural ties, following a series of high-level visits between Odisha and Singapore, including President Tharman Shanmugaratnam’s visit to Odisha in January and Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi’s trip to Singapore in late 2024.\n\nProjects like the World Skills Centre in Bhubaneswar, developed with support from Singapore’s Institute of Technical Education, further highlight the growing collaboration.\n\nDespite the popularity of Indian cuisine in Singapore, Odia food remains relatively underrepresented.\n\nThe festival sparked conversations around future avenues to bring more of Odisha’s culinary treasures to Singapore, with Odia Society Singapore president Subrat Nayak suggesting temple kitchens, like the International Sri Krishna Mandir in Geylang which already serves odia food, and pop-ups, as starting points.\n\nAs Chairman of the Indian Heritage Centre, R.

Kavi\n\nயோகிதா அன்புச்செழியன்\n\nWhen Tamil and Malayalam writer Kamaladevi Aravindan was inducted into the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame this year, it marked a major milestone in her decades-long literary journey.\n\nBut behind this public honour lies a quiet, unconventional creative partnership, one that turns the typical mother-daughter dynamic on its head.\n\nA prolific bilingual writer, the 75-year-old Mrs Kamaladevi is best known for her novels, short stories and children’s literature. She is also an accomplished playwright and screenwriter. Yet, she’s quick to credit much of her success to someone else – her daughter.\n\n“My literary success is my daughter,” said Mrs Kamaladevi. “She’s my harshest critic and my greatest pride.”\n\nHer daughter, Dr Anitha Devi Pillai, is an applied linguist and teacher educator at the National Institute of Education. But in Mrs Kamaladevi’s creative world, she is also an editor, translator and an unwavering supporter.\n\nTheir most significant collaboration is titled Sembawang – Mrs Kamaladevi’s first attempt at historical fiction – which Dr Anitha translated into English. The novel, which tells the story of a migrant woman’s life in Sembawang over five decades from the 1960s, was shortlisted for the Singapore History Prize.\n\nSet against key historical events like the Pulau Senang prison uprising in 1963 and a rape case at a maternal and child health clinic in 1968, the novel offers a vivid portrayal of life in a rapidly changing Singapore.\n\nMrs Kamaladevi, who moved from Malaysia to Singapore in the 1970s after marriage, said she wanted to capture the beauty and character of the place she called home. She began writing the novel in 2015, conducting interviews with former residents – some she knew, others she found through word-of-mouth.\n\nIt was this sense of nostalgia that prompted Dr Anitha to step in and offer to translate the work into English.\n\n“My mother has been writing stories for as long as I can remember,” said Dr Anitha. “But this one was different. It was about a place my parents often spoke about. I wanted others to also understand the deep sense of kinship that exists in Sembawang.”\n\nBut the process was far from simple. Rather than translating line by line, Dr Anitha spent months reading and researching to understand the historical and emotional weight behind her mother’s words.\n\n“I didn’t treat it as a direct translation. I wanted to convey the spirit of the story,” she said. Over two years, she verified historical details and even sourced for old photos from former residents to visualise scenes more accurately.\n\nThe book was published in both Tamil and English in 2020.\n\n“If it became a document worth preserving,” said Mrs Kamaladevi, “it’s because my daughter made it one.”\n\nBut Dr Anitha insists the credit goes to her mother. She attributes her love for languages, storytelling, and education to growing up surrounded by her mother’s literary world.\n\nRaised in a multilingual household – Malayalam at home, English in school and Tamil in the community – she often accompanied her mother to Tamil literary events.\n\n“I’d be this small child stuck on a chair, legs not reaching the floor, listening to poetry and speeches I didn’t fully understand. But those moments shaped me,” she said with a laugh.\n\nFor the family, Mrs Kamaladevi’s induction into the Hall of Fame was deeply moving. “I cried when I found out,” said Dr Anitha. “It’s one of the highest honours a writer can receive in Singapore.”\n\nWhat made it even more meaningful was the recognition of writers, particularly Tamil writers, who often work quietly, away from the spotlight.\n\n“Writers create in silence and are read in solitude,” said Dr Anitha. “To see someone like my mother honoured in this way is not just about her – it’s a win for all women who work behind the scenes, who tell stories and preserve culture.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/00a7980e072bcab9eb9f1aa749f1067649ad4bb7f77c3857c97334b57357aa4f?w=825", "alt_text": "Tamil and Malayalam writer Kamaladevi Aravindan and her daughter Anitha Devi Pillai."}]}

Both are accused of defrauding PNB by fraudulently obtaining Letters of Understanding (LoUs) from bank officials since 2011.\n\nThese LoUs, issued without proper collateral, enabled them to secure overseas loans that were allegedly used to pay off earlier debts rather than import pearls and diamonds as claimed – resulting in a cascading financial scam.\n\nChoksi’s arrest in Belgium came after Indian authorities issued multiple non-bailable warrants. He had been living in Antigua and Barbuda since 2018, where he secured citizenship just before the scam came to light.\n\nIn 2021, Choksi was briefly detained in Dominica under murky circumstances but was allowed to return to Antigua for medical treatment after a court ruling.\n\nAccording to sources, Choksi had quietly travelled to Belgium in 2023 for cancer treatment and had been living there since.\n\nHis lawyer Vijay Aggarwal confirmed the arrest and stated that Choksi would oppose the extradition request on humanitarian and political grounds, citing serious health issues and concerns over the fairness of a trial in India.\n\nDespite the arrest being seen as a diplomatic win for India, the path to extraditing Choksi is fraught with challenges.\n\nWhile India and Belgium share a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) and an extradition agreement that dates back to 1901 (later amended), the actual legal process could take months or even years due to European legal standards and human rights considerations.\n\nOne of the biggest legal obstacles is the “dual-criminality” clause, which requires that the offence Choksi is charged with in India must also be considered a crime under Belgian law.\n\nIndian authorities will need to demonstrate that Choksi’s alleged financial crimes meet this criterion.\n\nMoreover, Belgium, like most European nations, is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights. Choksi’s legal team is expected to argue that his human rights would be at risk if extradited, particularly due to his poor health and the allegedly politicised nature of his prosecution in India.\n\nThe PNB scam rocked India’s financial and political landscape in 2018, leading to a wave of investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\n\nChoksi, then owner of the high-profile Gitanjali Gems – with over 4,000 outlets and brands like Nakshatra and Gili – allegedly owes over Rs6,000 crore to 34 Indian banks.\n\nThe ED has so far seized assets worth over Rs2,500 crore belonging to Choksi and his firms, including real estate, jewellery and luxury vehicles.\n\nIn February 2021, an additional Rs14.45 crore worth of assets were attached, but efforts to liquidate these assets and repay affected banks have moved slowly.\n\nChoksi’s arrest is the latest in a string of attempts by India to bring back economic offenders who have fled abroad, including Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi – both currently fighting extradition from the UK.\n\n“This is a political case. He is not a flight risk. Extraditing him would severely compromise his human rights.”\n\nMehul Choksi’s  lawyer Vijay Aggarwal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/676d7addba1e4336959b2c1a9fc53a46519816bb72e55143073c3b328f9e9399?w=825", "alt_text": "Mehul Choksi in his Mumbai office before he fled India."}]}

It’s a story of triumph and disaster, tinged with comedy.”\n\nAmong the tales expected is the infamous story of Gower’s Tiger Moth flyover during a Test match – a prank that cemented his reputation as both golden boy and maverick.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowdrey brings his self-deprecating charm to the stage, joking that his England captaincy was likely the result of “nepotism,” referencing his father, Colin Cowdrey,  who played 114 Test matches for England from 1954 to 1975.\n\nBeyond the laughs, the duo is also committed to giving back.\n\nDuring their Singapore visit, they’ll engage with the Ministry of Education’s physical education teachers, delivering sessions on leadership and communication drawn from their experience captaining England.\n\n“We believe sport teaches invaluable lessons,” said Cowdrey. “Whether it’s teamwork or resilience, those skills go far beyond the boundary.”\n\nThe duo will also attend a charity dinner at the Singapore Cricket Club on May 16, raising funds for Samaritans of Singapore.\n\n“We’ve always been involved in charity,” Gower said, noting his presidency of the Lord’s Taverners, a UK-based charity for disadvantaged youth.\n\nCowdrey was also a former president, who swore by the slogan “giving young people, particularly those with special needs, a sporting chance”.\n\nTheir Singapore stopover also marks a return to familiar grounds – the pair last played in the city in 1978 as part of the Derrick Robins XI tour, fondly remembering games on the Padang and warm hospitality from the local cricketing community.\n\nThe Holy Bail is a rare chance to see two cricketing greats swap stories not in commentary boxes or press conferences, but live on stage.\n\n“Entertainment is what we promise,” said Gower, “and that’s what we’ll deliver.”\n\n“We believe sport teaches invaluable lessons. Whether it’s teamwork or resilience, those skills go far beyond the boundary.”\n\nFormer England captain Chris Cowdrey", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/70f60b140071e1d4720cc9609e6b1674d5517969e01fefba99eb87b7b178aa16?w=825", "alt_text": "Chris Cowdrey (left) and David Gower."}]}

They act like a sonic massage for the mind, gently kneading away tension and worry.”\n\nWhile classical compositions and gentle instrumentals are well-known for their calming effects, don’t underestimate the power of nature sounds. The gentle patter of rain, the rhythmic ebb and flow of ocean waves or the soft rustling of leaves can transport us to a tranquil state of mind.\n\nInterestingly, these natural soundscapes can be particularly effective when combined with soft background music.\n\nThis combination creates a rich, immersive experience that can help mask distracting noises and create a peaceful environment conducive to relaxation and focus.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8737454e0b07355f8867e7b4a0d02bb7bb6ab45f867f87909d36e06ad9a2f12e?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

There are so many languages, cultures, instruments – it’s impossible to do it all. But we try.”\n\nWith their second full-length album out in early 2025 and a world tour dubbed Return of the Singh taking them across Japan, the UK and Europe, Bloodywood is poised for another breakthrough.\n\nThey’ve topped Spotify’s global metal playlists and gained endorsements from icons across the genre, while building bridges between East and West through music.\n\nUltimately, what makes Bloodywood stand out isn’t just the pounding beats or cultural fusion – it’s their unshakable optimism and belief in music as a tool for empathy and empowerment.\n\n“What’s more metal than standing up for the people you love?” asks Katiyar.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/62f66e2a6c07b7b21e8d07d0dc153e841d4ac7b31b195e8d9772ba0dac45acc4?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Kavi\n\nReema Dudekula\n\nSingapore’s Indian community is a tapestry woven from diverse threads, and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong believes it is imperative to continue leveraging this diversity to strengthen its presence in Singapore.\n\nHe said the community has evolved into a “rich and distinctive Singaporean Indian culture,” praising it for punching above its weight. In spite of being a minority in Singapore, PM Wong acknowledged the Indian community’s outsized contributions in areas from business to government.\n\nThe Indian community in Singapore is not monolithic – it encompasses a multitude of ethnic groups, each with its own customs and practices. To continue elevating the group’s role, PM Wong said the community must foster a culture that harmonises with the broader national identity.\n\nIn his opening address at a dialogue organised by Tamil Murasu last Sunday called Vaanga Ippo Pesalaam (Come Let’s Chat, in Tamil), PM Wong reflected on the evolving identity of Singaporean Indians, highlighting how it stands apart from the identity of Indians in India.\n\n“For the Singaporean Indian, your values, your norms, your way of thinking are different from Indians in India. And it is something precious we have created here. It is a Singaporean attitude, mindset, way of life,” said PM Wong.\n\n“You can be proud of your ethnic roots and at the same time proud to be a Singaporean, that is what we mean by being a Singaporean,” he said, adding that being a Singaporean is never a matter of “subtraction but always a matter of addition”.\n\nPM Wong urged participants to continue building a distinct Singaporean Indian identity – one that honours cultural roots while also embracing engagement with fellow Singaporeans across communities to “enlarge the common space we share”.\n\nUltimately, the Singaporean Indian identity is not a static one. It is dynamic, fluid and shaped by both tradition and the lived experiences of growing up in one of the most diverse societies in the world.\n\nThe dialogue included Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Dr Janil Puthucheary and 130 youths across four universities and 13 community organisations.\n\nWith the General Election around the corner, there has been more discussion about PAP fielding new Indian candidates, which it did not do in the 2020 election.\n\nPM Wong said there will be new candidates from the PAP for the upcoming election, adding that outside of politics, Indians are also “excelling in the private sector, in business and so many different professions,” which is testament to how the community is thriving.\n\nThe young leaders present at the dialogue were between the ages of 18 and 35. The questions they asked PM Wong and Dr Janil concerned housing and employment issues, living costs and the pressure to get married and settle down. PM Wong in response assured the attendees that the government is paying attention to the issues raised by the youth.\n\nPM Wong has also been connecting with the youth of the country to get a better understanding of their thoughts during uncertain times for the global economy.\n\n“I want to make life in Singapore one where everyone can be their best selves… Singapore should be a place where our dreams can be worked on, a place where we can find belonging, even though the world is starting to look uncertain,” he said.\n\nDr Janil: Small size can be an advantage\n\nDr Janil Puthucheary spoke about the small size of the Singaporean Indian community – an aspect he believes to be a unique strength.\n\n“We could either lament it, or like Singapore, we can turn our size into an advantage,” he said, highlighting that the community’s compact size enables members to stay closely connected.\n\nOne such advantage, Dr Janil explained, is the community’s ability to build and maintain trust through long-standing bonds with familiar faces over time. “We can remain in close contact with everybody, leverage the connections, the networks, the friendships, the trust we have,” he said.\n\nDr Janil also acknowledged the concerns facing Indian youth in Singapore, including issues related to employment, education, mental health, and the evolving landscape of social media.\n\n“There are a few things that, as an Indian community, we have different views about and some of that is informed by our history, our heritage, our community… (that) is very diverse,” Dr Janil said.\n\nHe encouraged the community to see this diversity as a strength, before addressing these concerns in the Q&A session that followed.\n\nIn his opening remarks, PM Wong praised Dr Janil as a shining example of Singaporean Indian excellence. “It is very difficult to come from the private sector into the government to do policy work,” he said. “(He) is a very capable person and a key player of our team.”\n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong flanked by Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary and Tamil Murasu News Editor Irshath Mohamed.\n\nPhoto: T Kavi\n\n“For the Singaporean Indian, your values, your norms, your way of thinking are different from Indians in India.

As she navigates this revelation, she inherits not just her father’s exceptional deductive skills, but also his unrelenting pursuit of truth and justice.\n\nThe film will explore her emotional evolution as she uncovers dark secrets, tackles a dangerous case, and ultimately, redefines what it means to carry the Holmes legacy.\n\nDeepa, known for her Oscar-nominated film Water and the Elements Trilogy (Fire, Earth, and Water), expressed excitement about the project, describing it as a “radical reinvention” that blends mystery, identity, and legacy.\n\n“We’ve seen countless reboots of Sherlock Holmes, but never through the eyes of a daughter, especially one rooted in an Indian heritage. This is about inheritance – emotional and intellectual – and carving one’s own place in the world,” Deepa said.\n\nThe screenplay has been written by newcomer Shrabani Deodhar, and sources say the story draws inspiration from both Arthur Conan Doyle’s universe and themes of diaspora, feminism and cultural duality.\n\nCasting is currently underway, with production expected to begin in late 2025.\n\nProducer Nisha noted that the film will challenge conventional portrayals of Holmes and detective fiction as a whole.\n\n“The Daughter is about reclaiming space in a genre that has long been dominated by male, Eurocentric narratives. This film will introduce a heroine who is fiercely independent, whip-smart, and entirely relatable to a modern global audience,” said Nisha.\n\nThe movie will be shot primarily in London, with potential segments in India to flesh out the protagonist’s cultural roots.\n\nWhile the character of Holmes will appear in some capacity – potentially through flashbacks or as a symbolic presence – the narrative will firmly focus on his daughter’s journey, struggles, and triumphs.\n\nThis marks Deepa Mehta’s return to narrative features after recent forays into television and documentary work. Her most recent project, Funny Boy, was praised for its sensitive portrayal of identity and self-discovery – themes that will likely resonate again in The Daughter.\n\nThe announcement has already generated buzz among fans of detective fiction and those eager for fresh, inclusive stories.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d050d52f6e36abe72deecd935551eb7c85e736ddf7d761c5e4daec24dbd0a502?w=825", "alt_text": "Deepa Mehta"}]}

Yet, a book’s utility is often limited by the number of people who read it.\n\nSadly, after buying and reading books, many people leave them on their shelves to collect dust, effectively ending their useful lifespan.\n\nShalibeth Tiffany, 17, decided to tackle this challenge by creating innovative community book-sharing platforms for schools and the wider community across Singapore.\n\nShe launched a trio of websites – middletonreads.com, schoolreads.com and sgreads.com – in January this year. Through these platforms, students and the general public can give away their books while requesting books that they would like to get their hands on.\n\nShe is officially launching the initiative in her school, Middleton International School, for over 400 secondary school students during its book week in April themed “Sustainability in Literature”.\n\nShalibeth owes the idea to her upbringing. Since the age of two, she has been surrounded by books thanks to the bookshelf that her parents Suresh and Viji set up for her.\n\nThat seeded her love for books so much so that at the ages of six and 10, she even wrote and published two children’s books of a series named Shalibeth Stories.\n\nHer father Suresh Devadoss, 45, said: “She would spend most of her time reading books. Because of that, at one point, I was even planning to shift our home next to a library.”\n\nYet, that passion also resulted in disappointment when she could not get her hand on popular series like Percy Jackson and Thea Stilton despite her frequent trips to community libraries. “I would be lucky if even one of the books in those series were on the shelf,” she said.\n\nAs she grew older, she moved on from children’s fiction to political history and economics books, the experience of which unearthed one more pain point – the fines.\n\nShalibeth recalls: “Those thick books laden with jargon would take me time to read and often I would not be able to finish them within the borrowing period and had to pay fines.”\n\nThat sparked the idea for Middleton Reads. “What if I create a system where students can get books that they so badly want to read, from their fellow students? And what if it was done on a giveaway basis without a loan period attached?” These were the questions on Shalibeth’s mind.\n\nShe also realised that many of her own books were also collecting dust on the shelf. She will never forget the sheer joy on her classmate’s face when she lent her a book that the latter had been searching for long. “At that moment, I knew that this idea could benefit so many people and that I had to get started on it.”\n\nShalibeth planned the layouts of each website. While web programming was an entirely different ball game, her dad’s friend who works in the IT sector, gave expert guidance in converting Shalibeth’s idea from paper to web. Her dad also took great interest in refining the idea and the end product.\n\nWith the first version of the website in hand, Shalibeth approached her teachers in Middleton International.\n\nMs Susan Sawarkar, Head of Secondary Pastoral Care at Middleton, said: “The sustainability aspect of the idea drew us. We did previously have book donation drives but Shalibeth’s idea makes book-sharing more accessible rather than stopping as a one-time event.”\n\nThe idea is sustainable in multiple ways.

That was overwhelming,” recalled Madam Rabiah, a mother of three.\n\n“But I kept thinking of Sita and her two young children. That gave me the strength to push through.”\n\n“She was in a very bad state. Very weak and fragile. My sister even broke down seeing her like that.”\n\nMadam Rabiah embarked on an intense fitness and diet regimen with the help of her son Mohd Anis, 29, a freelance personal trainer.\n\nIt included regular exercises such as swimming and walking daily.\n\nShe also followed a strict customised protein diet recommended by her son. It consisted of lean meats like chicken and fish and lots of vegetables.\n\nSaid Mr Anis: “Deciding to donate a kidney was a major step for my mother. We both understood that she had a journey ahead. She needed to lose weight and improve her overall health, especially after leading a sedentary lifestyle for so long.\n\n“Adapting to the training, even the basics, was tough for her at first. But she stayed committed and gradually, the lifestyle changes began to pay off.\n\n“It wasn’t always easy – staying disciplined with meals and ensuring proper nutrition was a challenge. But I’m grateful I could support her through it, and even more grateful that the kidney recipient is now safe and well.”\n\nMadam Rabiah’s determination eventually paid off and she lost 13kg in just three months, dropping to 79kg and meeting the medical requirements for surgery.\n\nAnother reason Madam Rabiah wanted to help Ms Sita was because of her late elder brother who was killed in a motorcycle accident 24 years ago. It left an emptiness in her.\n\nWhen she heard of Ms Sita’s plight, she decided to honour her brother’s memory by giving someone the gift of life.\n\n“I wanted closure for my brother’s death. If someone had helped my brother maybe he would have been alive now. So I wanted to help someone.”\n\nOn Dec 17 last year, Madam Rabiah successfully donated her kidney.\n\nThough she faced post-surgical challenges, she managed to recover within two weeks and gradually returned to her daily routine.\n\nThe senior administration and operations executive with the Asian Women’s Welfare Association returned to work on March 4 after two and a half months.\n\n“I am so grateful for my colleagues as they were very understanding. They agreed to manage the workload while I was on hospitalisation leave.”\n\n“I always make sure that I check on Sita. She’s on the road to recovery and I am so glad there weren’t any complications.\n\n“This wasn’t just about me getting healthier. It was about giving someone another chance to live.”\n\nSince the surgery, Madam Rabiah has taken to social media to share her journey, hoping to inspire others to consider organ donation.\n\nShe is maintaining her weight at 79kg and has been consistently following the diet plan.\n\nShe has slowed down on her workout regime as her doctor told her not to strain herself. She walks daily and hopes to resume swimming soon.\n\n“I want people to know that sometimes, the biggest motivator for change is helping someone else,” she said. “Whether it’s losing weight or donating an organ, we are capable of more than we think.”\n\nMdm Rabiah Hussain working out.\n\nPhoto: Rabiah Hussain\n\n“I want people to know that sometimes, the biggest motivator for change is helping someone else.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Katong Community Centre came alive with colour, culture and celebration on April 5 as the Mountbatten CC Indian Activity Executive Committee (IAEC) hosted Sangamam — a vibrant Indian New Year festival that brought together more than 400 people from across Singapore’s diverse communities.\n\nSangamam, meaning “confluence,” symbolised the spirit of the event – a coming together of cultures, traditions and people in harmony.\n\nThe celebration showcased the rich diversity of Indian New Year traditions, while paying homage to the historical contributions of Indian communities in Singapore.\n\n“Sangamam was more than just a festive celebration. It was a heartfelt tribute to our shared heritage,” said Ms Aarti Naidu, chairperson of Mountbatten CC IAEC. “We wanted residents to understand the journey of the Indian community here, and how every culture adds a unique thread to Singapore’s social fabric.”\n\nThe three-hour programme transported the audience on a thematic journey – beginning with the first Indian footprints in Singapore and evolving into a cultural showcase of New Year traditions from across Indian states.\n\nA striking display of old photographs of Indian migrants in Singapore created a nostalgic backdrop, honouring the past while celebrating the present.\n\nFourteen Indian associations participated in the celebration, each presenting a unique cultural segment representing their state’s New Year (celebrated from March 30 to April 14 across different states) customs – from Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, Vishu in Kerala, Baisakhi in Punjab to Puthandu in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDance performances lit up the stage, with traditional folk acts like Bihu from Assam, Malhari from Maharashtra, Kuthu Pattu from Tamil Nadu, Mohiniyattam from Kerala and vibrant folk numbers from Gujarat and West bengal captivating the crowd.\n\nInterwoven into these performances were stories of the first Indian immigrants who arrived from Bhojpur under British colonial rule in the late 19th century — reinforcing the deep-rooted historical ties between India and Singapore.\n\nMr T.J. Selvam, organising chair of the event, remarked: “It was truly a memorable experience. From the traditional music to the incredible energy of the performers, every act was thoughtfully curated. It was heartwarming to see people from different backgrounds join in the celebration with such joy and unity.”\n\nThe event also focused on building community connections. Interactive games, ice-breakers and a tantalising food spread featuring 15 dishes from different Indian states gave residents a chance to connect with their neighbours over shared experiences.\n\nMountbatten MP and Guest-of-Honour Lim Biow Chuan applauded the event’s inclusive spirit. “In India, the New Year often marks the start of harvest. While we don’t have farms here in Singapore, we celebrate the start of something new – together. What I see here is the very essence of Singapore: mutual respect, curiosity about each other’s traditions, and a strong sense of community.”\n\nThe event received enthusiastic praise from attendees.\n\nMadam Tang, a 70-year-old resident, said: “The performances were so vibrant and informative. It was wonderful to learn about the different traditions.”\n\nParticipant Sindhu Krishna from the Singapore Malayalee Association, said: “What a fantastic event – it struck the perfect balance between being educational and entertaining. Huge kudos to the volunteers for their warm hospitality and attention to detail.”\n\nChairperson of Bihar Jharkhand Association Singapore Shiwan Khirwali  added: “The diversity of India was beautifully showcased and everyone enjoyed the experience.”\n\nThe event successfully captured the spirit of India’s New Year festivals while aligning with Singapore’s ethos of inclusivity.\n\n“This is just the beginning,” said Ms Aarti. “Sangamam has shown us the power of celebrating together. We hope to continue creating more such platforms for cultural exchange and unity.”\n\n“Sangamam was more than just a festive celebration. It was a heartfelt tribute to our shared heritage.

Tragically, the fire claimed the life of a young girl and left several others hospitalised.\n\nMark has since been moved out of the emergency ward of a Singapore hospital but remains under observation after undergoing a bronchoscopy – a procedure used to examine lung damage, commonly administered in fire-related injuries.\n\nThe news quickly reached Mr Kalyan on April 8 while he was on an official tour in Andhra Pradesh’s Alluri Sitarama Raju district, reported India Today.\n\nHe immediately cancelled his scheduled engagements in Visakhapatnam and flew to Singapore to be with his son.\n\nHe was accompanied by his brother, actor-politician Chiranjeevi and sister-in-law Surekha.\n\nIn a heartfelt statement, Mr Kalyan assured well-wishers that Mark is recovering. He thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu for reaching out personally. “The PM’s call gave me great courage,” he noted.\n\nMr Kalyan also shared the emotional timing of the event – the fire occurred on the birthday of his elder son, Akira Nandan. “It’s a strange coincidence,” he remarked.\n\nMark is the son of Mr Kalyan and his third wife, Russian model and actress Anna Lezhneva.\n\nThe couple met during the filming of Telugu romance-drama Teen Maar in 2011 and tied the knot in 2013.\n\nMs Lezhneva holds a Master of Arts degree from the National University of Singapore and an honours degree in Oriental Studies from the University of St Petersburg.\n\nShe is said to own luxury properties and hotel investments in Singapore and Russia, with an estimated net worth of Rs1,800 crore ($280 million), according to The Economic Times.\n\nDespite past speculation of marital discord – fuelled by her absence at high-profile family events – Ms Lezhneva has recently been a pillar of support.\n\nShe actively participated in Mr Kalyan’s election campaign and victory celebrations last year, laying to rest rumours and reasserting her presence within the Konidela clan.\n\nMr Kalyan’s family background adds weight to every event involving him.

I know that I am old but, then, music is older. I cannot be too old for it.\n\nFrom the time I learnt to hear, certain kinds of popular music played on All India Radio inspired unbearable joy in me. I came to understand why only much later. It was because those film songs were based on raagas such as Malkauns, Piloo, Bhupali and Desh.\n\nI had a good voice, but no one put me in a musical school. So, I sang as well as I could, without instruction by a disciplining teacher or accompaniment by a musical instrument. I simply sang as if there was no world without me and I did not exist without music.\n\nAs a Bengali, I identified myself instinctively with the sonorous rhythms and patterns of Rabindra sangeet, songs written by Rabindranath Tagore which often transgress the formal boundaries of raagas; and with Nazrulgeeti, the songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam which are far more raaga-observient but are rooted in the intimate inflections of the Bengali language.\n\nI identified my cultural existence with the songs of those two master-Bengalis.\n\nBoth Rabindra sangeet and Nazrulgeeti drove me on, towards Hindustani and Carnatic classical music. Since I understood Hindi, my ears turned more easily towards Hindustani raaga-based songs.\n\nThen, work and life took me to other places and experiences. The erotic immediacy of the raaga-based songs played on radio receded from me.\n\nTrue, I could now identify the four raagas that I have mentioned, but they became vocal memories of my past, not conversational companions of my present.\n\nHearing myself again\n\nRecently, I came across an advertisement produced by Artium Academy, an Indian online music learning platform that allows people anywhere in the world to learn Hindustani classical music (among many other vocal and instrumental choices). A free trial session followed. It opened my ears to myself again.\n\nI was asked to sing a few lines of any song that I knew. I chose a Tagore song that did not challenge my poor breath control and my inability to rise to a heavenly treble or descend to an everlasting bass.\n\nI sang, and thought that I would be laughed away. Instructor Ravi Mishra, who vetted me, noticed that I had gasped on both ascent and descent. He added, however, that I had remained faithful to sur, or the musical notes of sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni that constitute the foundational architecture of Indian music.\n\nI thought that he was being polite to an old man till Ravi-ji, who does not understand Bengali, took the opening lines of the Tagore song I had sung and sang the music back to me without the words.\n\nHe captured the sur perfectly. I could tell that because I, too, had sung within the ambit of sur. What a surprise to a fallen devotee of music!\n\nA week later, I had my first session with my teacher, Chaitanya Tambe. Speaking from Mandla in Madhya Pradesh to a learner in Telok Blangah in Singapore, Pandit-ji demonstrated the metaphysical materialism of music by telling me how it is rooted in our birth and environment and yet transcends both, one properly-taken breath, one rightly-sung note, one furtive foray into eternity at a time.\n\nI have begun by practising deep breathing and aligning my breath to the depth and reach of my voice, as best as I can.\n\nI am absolutely certain that I shall fail to reach the standards that even three-year-olds master. Their musical wanderings lie a lifetime ahead of them.\n\nMy wandering life lies behind me increasingly. The young have time to reach perfection. Perfection no longer has time for me.\n\nYet, the youngest singer who succeeds and the oldest singer who fails are united by the bonds of sur and raaga.\n\nMusical notes are immune to the passage of time; their imaginative arrangements flourish in the flowering of time.\n\nEither way, though, sur and raaga collaborate to celebrate the presence of humanity in time – humanity that learns to sing back to the universe in which it was created.\n\nPlease wish this old learner well, even when he fails.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/community/opinion/music-life-even-ageing-ears?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

They had prioritised the rescue over their own safety.\n\nIn the 10 minutes before the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) arrived, they saved the lives of 10 children.\n\nMr Subramanian Saranraj, 34, was one of the workers. The sight of children with soot marks on their face, coughing and struggling to breathe while wailing for help is one that he will never forget.\n\nThe lorry driver had just dropped some workers off at Valley Lodge Condominium for renovation work and was driving off. Just when he was about to make a right turn at about 9.40am, he saw the crowd around the burning shophouse.\n\nSaid Mr Saranraj, who hails from Tamil Nadu: “I got off the lorry immediately and through the smoke, saw a male teacher and children looking out of the window, frantically crying out for help. The fumes were getting bigger, and we didn’t have much time.”\n\n“We too have children. Had it been our kids, would we have stood by and done nothing?”\n\nThose words were echoed by his colleague Mr Nagarajan Anbarasan, 37, who was also among the first responders. “When we saw the children in distress, we couldn’t bear it.”\n\nThey decided against running up the stairs to get to the children as the smoke was too thick.\n\nMr Saranraj said: “We didn’t have any protective equipment to guard against the fumes. We were not familiar with the building as well and didn’t know where the stairs were. So we went for the windows.”\n\nMr Saranraj recalled the panic all around. “Some children even wanted to jump down but we reassured them and rescued them one by one.”\n\nThe only fatality was a 10-year-old Australian girl who died in hospital.\n\nOf the 22 casualties, 16 were children aged between six and 10. The other six were adults aged between 23 and 55.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said its Assurance, Care and Engagement (Ace) Group, which safeguards the well-being of migrant workers here, would acknowledge the workers who helped in the fire.\n\nFour workers – Mr Saranraj, Mr Anbarasan, Mr Sivasami Vijayaraj and Mr Inderjit Singh – received the Friends of Ace coins on April 9 from MOM.\n\n“Their quick thinking and bravery made all the difference...

Bringing love back to the big screen.”\n\nThe teaser, which features Fawad serenading co-star Vaani Kapoor against the dreamy backdrop of London, quickly went viral, reported the Times of India.\n\nThe film, directed by Aarti S Bagdi, is described as a “heartwarming tale” with love, laughter, and unexpected turns. The title Abir Gulaal references the Hindu festival of colours, Holi.\n\nThis marks Fawad’s first Bollywood film since 2016, when an unofficial ban on Pakistani talent was imposed by Indian film associations following the Uri terrorist attacks.\n\nSince then, tensions between India and Pakistan led to a complete freeze in creative collaborations.\n\nHowever, in 2023, the Bombay High Court ruled against a petition calling for a permanent ban, calling it “a retrograde step in promoting cultural harmony.”\n\nThe legal shift has opened doors, and Fawad’s return feels symbolic of renewed cross-border dialogue.\n\n“Art has no borders,” Bollywood veteran Sushmita Sen said at a recent event. “Creativity is born from freedom, and I wish that for everyone.”\n\nDespite the buzz, not everyone is pleased. Right-wing political groups, including the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), have opposed the film’s release, citing national interest, reported India Today.\n\n“We will not let the film release in India, and that’s final,” declared the MNS cinema wing president. Neither Fawad nor the film’s producers have publicly addressed the threats.\n\nStill, optimism is running high. Actor Ridhi Dogra, who stars in the film, said: “The film’s tagline is ‘Bringing love back’. We hope to focus on love and the beautiful things in the world, because there’s already too much hatred.”\n\nShe added that the film has received “a lot more love than hate” since its teaser launched.\n\nPakistani fans, however, may not get to see the film in local cinemas, as Pakistan has continued its ban on Indian films, reported CNN.\n\n“As a fan of both Pakistani dramas and Hindi cinema, I’ll be disappointed to miss out on this creative collaboration,” said Lahore-based journalist Abbas Hussain.\n\nIndustry insiders say Fawad’s return also signals a shift in Bollywood. “His comeback reminds us what art can truly achieve — collapsing national boundaries, bringing people closer, and giving fans a reason to smile,” said Indian film critic Tanul Thakur.\n\nThe stakes are high for Abir Gulaal.

But my introduction to it wasn’t easy.\n\nBak chor mee? No way! That was my first reaction to a Singaporean colleague’s question way back in November 2006.\n\nIt was my first month in Singapore and I was still getting used to Singlish.\n\nBack in Mumbai, the cultural and vibrant melting pot of India, Bak is slang for get lost or scoot. Chor means thief.\n\nDespite my misgivings, I still went along with my colleague Ian Lee to the Tai Hwa Pork Noodle stall at Crawford Lane.\n\nThere was an unending queue and while we waited our turn, I asked Ian why this place was so popular.\n\nHis reply was simple: “This one shiok lah, brudder.”\n\nMy anglicised Indian side began to process this as a shock to the digestive system but being the adventurous type when food is involved, I was game.\n\nFifteen minutes later, I was staring at a senior gentleman with spectacles who bluntly asked me: “You pork ah?”\n\nI’m large-sized, and have been called many names, but never “Porky”.\n\nUpset, I said: “No pork.”\n\nHe followed with: “You halal ah?”\n\nThat’s when Ian stepped in and said: “He’s asking if you can eat pork.”\n\nWhat a relief. “Tell him I can eat everything.”\n\nThe stall owner still wasn’t done with his questionnaire and he had one more: “Mee kia? Mee pok?”\n\nThis was easy now. I had a handle on the lingo and was prepared to level up with the man.\n\n“Me Indian but eat pork,” I replied.\n\nPointing to the noodles, which were bunched separately, he asked me again, “Which mee you?”\n\nI wasn’t familiar with Chinese noodles but I knew a few Japanese ones.\n\nThe closest that bore a resemblance to me would be udon so that’s what I replied.\n\nA quick conversation between Ian and the stall owner followed, and I didn’t need to know Mandarin or Hokkien to figure that my friend would be handling the order.\n\nFor the next few minutes I silently watched with admiration as the man with the chopsticks\nproceeded to use a bowl like an artist would his canvas.\n\nHe started by tossing the noodles in oil and vinegar before adding toppings of minced pork, sliced pork, meatballs, pork liver, wanton (Chinese dumplings) and fried salted fish.\n\nThis was dry bak chor mee accompanied by a small serving of soup. While I was still admiring the chef’s craft, his next statement brought me back to my newbie confused state: “Taugay?”\n\nOnce again Ian stepped in to inform me that taugay are mung bean sprouts and if I would like a helping on the side.\n\nI sheepishly accepted them on a small plate and off we went to a table which Ian had reserved with his office pass.\n\nThe Tai Hwa bak chor mee comes in three portions – small, medium and large. I opted for the medium-sized bowl as the small one does not come with wantons (dumplings) which I love to bits.\n\nOur choice of noodles was mee kia (normal egg noodles). Customers can also opt for mee pok (flat egg noodles) or kway teow (white rice noodles).\n\nI had a little bit of chilli and a generous dose of vinegar added to my bowl.\n\nMy first forkful and I was amazed at the layered flavours dancing on my tongue.\n\nThe whole mix was fragrant and savoury with a bite from the chilli, a sour yet satisfying kick from the vinegar and an overall umami (the fifth taste) experience.\n\nThe perfect springiness of the noodles just added to the delightful culinary experience for me, making it one of the best noodle bowls I had ever eaten.\n\nAs an Indian, I was concerned about the minced meat being raw but it was extremely fresh.\n\nAnd once the dish was fully prepared, it was cooked perfectly with all the condiments and sauce absorbed.\n\nI wasn’t a fan of pork liver but the manner in which the vinegar and chilli turned it into a delicious addition was addictive. Not one of the ingredients in the bowl overpowered the other, only complementing each other.\n\nI have since been to most bak chor mee stalls around Singapore, some which add sole fish as an ingredient too. But I always go back to the first stall that introduced me to this comfort food.\n\nThere is something about the Tai Hwa bak chor mee that ticks all the boxes for me, and I’m forever grateful to its owner Tang Chay Seng for his recipe and contribution to the Singaporean cuisine landscape.\n\nI could have gone into much detail about the dish and its ingredients but I’d rather that you discover it for yourself.\n\nOriginally located at Hill Street and later Marina Square, the stall is now at Crawford Lane since it’s relocation in 2004.\n\nSo if you haven’t tried bak chor mee as yet, don’t wait.\n\nTake the plunge and get drowned in a whirlpool of flavours, like I did.\n\nMy only advice is, if you are new to Singapore, let your local pal or colleague do the ordering. You’ll thank me later.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/77d0cbbe152daba8dc51a06166b964981ac9fb8dca9c339ee68fd64ad94a31cf?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Tang Chay Seng has been running Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle stall in Crawford Lane since 2004."}]}

The retort was not received well by the public, specifically male audiences.\n\nRecalling the controversial moment, she said: “The guy standing there made an extremely inappropriate comment about my vagina in front of a live audience. Usually, you’d expect that kind of remark on social media. But to hear it in public was shocking.”\n\nShe explained that her response wasn’t meant to be “funny” or “savage”, but came from a place of anger and retaliation.\n\n“I never intended to hurt anyone – except maybe that man’s ego,” she admitted, before acknowledging that her words may have unintentionally offended others. “I’ve learnt my lesson, and I promise to be better going forward.”\n\nShe also issued a public apology: “I just hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I’m sincerely sorry if I’ve hurt your sentiments.”\n\nBeyond the controversy, the 23-year-old opened up about her harrowing personal struggles, reported The Mint.\n\nIn a raw and emotional segment, she spoke about being slut-shamed by relatives, facing domestic abuse, and battling mental health issues including self-harm.\n\n“I have cried a lot of sleepless nights in a house that never felt like home for 17 years… I’ve been hit by someone who promised to protect me,” she revealed. “I thought it was over so many times… but it isn’t.”\n\nApoorva also highlighted the intensity of online hate, sharing screenshots of acid attack and rape threats she received after the incident.\n\n“And that’s not even one per cent,” she wrote on Instagram in a recent post. Despite the toxic backlash and losing brand deals and personal relationships, she expressed gratitude to those who supported her privately.\n\nShe concluded the video by reflecting on the unexpected downfall she faced. “It was my worst nightmare to become irrelevant.”\n\nApoorva’s video has since received an outpouring of support from fans and fellow creators, with many commending her for her courage, honesty, and vulnerability.\n\nOn the legal front, the India’s Got Latent episode led to widespread criticism, multiple police reports, and questioning of several influencers, including Apoorva, Samay Raina, Ranveer Allahbadia, Ashish Chanchlani and others.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c284cae3403f80182eac2cd10143c2c8253a7b9a911e618286e04fd1f389c2f4?w=825", "alt_text": "Influencer Apoorva Mukhija in the YouTube video."}]}

Every politician must master the media of their time and now it’s TikTok and IG,” he said.\n\nRishi responded that he himself used to be politically apathetic, which is why he created the podcast series to get more people engaged in political conversations.\n\nIn addition to interviews, the podcasts feature game segments where Rishi and his guests try to craft punchlines from partially redacted headlines.\n\nAnother segment involves flashing photos of politicians and prompting guests to say the first word that comes to mind.\n\n“It is not incredibly hard and there is no right or wrong. It’s just about being funny,” Rishi said.\n\nA politics-comedy podcast is a passion project Rishi had long hoped to pursue but lacked the time and resources to bring to life until now.\n\n“It’s us trying out something that I have always wanted to do but maybe didn’t have the time, the bandwidth or the budget in the past, and now I have an opportunity and things are coming together,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about the saturation of political podcasts in the runup to the elections, Rishi said that he has no expectations and no worries about losing money or his audience because he never started the project with that in mind.\n\n“It is purely a creative experiment that is self-motivated and self-funded through the multiple Punjabi weddings I have done over the years,” Rishi quipped.\n\nThe podcast is helmed by a team that includes Dora Goh, 34 – Rishi’s manager and the show’s producer – alongside an editing crew that handles the graphics, post-production and social media outreach.\n\nMost of the interview questions are fielded by Rishi, who also does the research on the guests.\n\n“It’s a lot of back end work, so I have got a very hardworking team managing that. I focus more on directly reaching out to the guests, connecting with them and inviting them to be on the podcast,” Rishi said.\n\nHe hopes the show offers politicians and other guests a chance to show a more personable side while keeping viewers informed in an engaging and entertaining way.\n\nAll episodes of the first season will be rolled out in the lead-up to polling day.\n\nA post-election round-up episode may follow and there could be a second season later in the year.\n\nRishi’s interest in politics began in 2011 while sourcing material for his stand-up comedy shows.\n\n“Singapore politics became relevant to me when I started creating jokes about it because that’s what the audience were enjoying and were laughing at,” Rishi said.\n\nThat same year marked Singapore’s 11th General Election – a watershed moment in the country’s political history. For the first time, the ruling PAP lost a Group Representation Constituency to the opposition.\n\n“It all became talking points, joking points and I always feel that humour is a great way to digest it, peel off the layers and get people interested in the maybe not so exciting subject matter of politics,” Rishi said.\n\nA graduate from Nanyang Technological University’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Rishi also hopes to become a better journalist and a better interviewer through The Rishi Report.\n\n“Maybe it’s partially selfish but I’m hoping to become a better conversationalist and be more informed about everything that is going on in Singapore right now,” he said.\n\nWhile entertaining guests at a Punjabi wedding and interviewing a political officeholder may seem worlds apart, Rishi notes that, at their core, both are essentially two human beings communicating with each other.\n\nThis is evident throughout the first episode of the podcast series where Rishi addresses Mr Ong as “bro” and “sir” interchangeably.\n\n“It’s not meant as a term of disrespect and we often have the misconception that we need to revere our leaders and treat them like elders but if we treat them like a fellow human being and humanise them, I think they appreciate that,” Rishi said.\n\n“It is purely a creative experiment that is self-motivated and self-funded through the multiple Punjabi weddings I have done over the years.”\n\nRishi Budhrani", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b8b68ab505325be210ec97454ceaba4beba3cbed38ca4ce99fd99c0216b1aecf?w=825", "alt_text": "Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung on The Rishi Report podcast with host Rishi Budhrani."}]}

Kavi\n\nயோகிதா அன்புச்செழியன்\n\nAs Singapore advances as a smart nation, the annual Tamil Language Festival (TLF) is keeping pace by harnessing technology and innovation to connect with the next generation.\n\n“Young people today are quick, visual and digital. You can’t speak at length to them and expect engagement,” said Mr Naseer Ghani, chairman of the Tamil Language Council (TLC), which has been organising the festival since 2007.\n\nTLF 2025, which runs from April 5 to May 4, has returned with a renewed emphasis on engaging younger audiences. Of the 46 programmes lined up this year, 74 per cent are youth-centric, a rise from last year’s 65 per cent.\n\nMr Ghani told tabla! on the sidelines of the TLF 2025 launch ceremony at The Theatre at Mediacorp on April 6 that the team had carefully considered what resonates with today’s youth – concise, impactful messaging and content infused with technology – and shaped the festival’s programming accordingly.\n\nMinister of State for Law and Transport Murali Pillai, who was the guest of honour, said: “The future of the Tamil language lies in the hands of the younger generation.”\n\nThis year’s festival carries the theme “Ilamai”, meaning youth in Tamil – but its focus goes beyond just young people. “This isn’t just a festival for youth. Ilamai also symbolises freshness, relevance and continuity which are values that appeal across generations,” said Mr Ghani.\n\nProgrammes this year range from app development competitions and creative coding using Tamil script to youth-led poetry slams, modern literature discussions and sessions on developing translation skills.\n\nParticipants will also explore traditional art forms through fresh interpretations, combining culture with contemporary expression.\n\nTo encourage new ideas, TLC opened public calls for programme proposals, resulting in collaborations with four new partner organisations. In total, 47 groups are presenting programmes this year.\n\nMr Ghani said TLC is actively exploring how Tamil can ride the digital wave. “We are thinking about how artificial intelligence, social media and content platforms can be used not just to preserve Tamil, but to make it attractive and accessible.”\n\nThe festival’s opening also paid homage to Tamil’s evolution in Singapore’s multicultural landscape.\n\nThe emcees also noted the role of Tamil media in the growth and preservation of the Tamil language in Singapore.\n\nMarking its 90th anniversary this year, Tamil Murasu was recognised for its significant contributions as Singapore’s only daily Tamil newspaper.\n\nThe evening also featured performances that symbolised how age-old wisdom can inspire new artistic expressions.\n\n“Let us all come together to speak Tamil, celebrate Tamil and love Tamil. This festival is our shared stage to keep the language vibrant and alive,” said Mr Ghani.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fb75b3b1cabf979790b859b03c2bcdd424ee2def568e4d7822886180aa57ae7b?w=825", "alt_text": "To commemorate the theme “youth”, young performers from various groups held up a placard to kickstart the Tamil Language Festival."}]}

Rajamouli’s upcoming Mahesh Babu starrer, SSMB29, which is reportedly budgeted at Rs1,000 crore.\n\nThe announcement came on April 8, coinciding with Arjun’s birthday, and follows the massive success of Pushpa 2, which grossed over US$210 million globally, reported India Today.\n\nThe film promises to be a high-concept, pan-India spectacle with global aspirations and is scheduled to begin production this month.\n\nAccording to reports, Arjun will pocket Rs175 crore for the film, along with a 15 per cent profit share.\n\nAtlee, riding high on the success of Jawan, is being paid Rs100 crore – a testament to his rising clout in Indian cinema.\n\nThe film’s VFX-heavy production will cost an estimated Rs250 crore, with another Rs200 crore allocated for principal production, reported Variety.\n\n“This is the film I have always dreamed of making,” Atlee said in a statement. “To bring it to life with icon star Allu Arjun under the visionary leadership of Kalanithi Maran is a dream come true.

Initially pursuing a career in business after obtaining a degree from the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow and spending four years working in major MNCs, the 38-year-old quickly realised that her true passion was pulling a laugh out of people.\n\nShe took the plunge into Mumbai’s bustling comedy circuit in 2018 when she participated in Amazon Prime’s Comicstaan, the stepping stone to her illustrious career in the stand-up scene.\n\nAs she inches closer to her show in Singapore, Prashasti tells us if gender plays a role in  the traditionally male-dominated stand-up industry, about the pressure a comedian feels to reinvent oneself and her plans beyond touring the new show.\n\nDivine Feminine, she says, is an amalgamation of musings over the past year of her experience as a woman in her late 30s who has achieved great professional success but wonders if the sacrifices were worthwhile.\n\nShe questions all her life choices and meticulously assigns blame to the women and men who shaped her into who she is today.\n\nFemale rage against the patriarchy is a common topic that most female comedians explore in their material as it is, after all, a unifying experience.\n\n“I remember experiencing a mental block when I was told that my anger is very female, my stories are very female, that every other female comedian was saying the same thing – so in my second special, Man of the House, I purposely strayed away from that. I put a filter on me and assessed my jokes based on whether a man would make the same jokes. It felt so contrived. In Divine Feminine I allowed myself to fully express myself,” she said.\n\nPrashasti, whose liberal parents allowed her to be herself, found it fair to assume that she would be more shielded from the realities of societal impositions.\n\nHowever, to her dismay, that was not the case. “I am still treated like a sidekick or a supporting actor. So that fuelled my anger and I stopped trying to go away from this emotion and gave in instead.\n\n“The great thing about comedy is that five people can use the same topic and, while their take on it might be similar, the voice is not,” Prashasti said, adding that if men can keep doing that, women should be allowed to as well.\n\nThrough her years of experience, she realised that pandering only resulted in her pigeonholing herself.\n\n“My biggest strength is when I express myself honestly. I do not want to think about what it is becoming, I want to focus on what it is.”\n\nThis then sparked the conversation about how safe it really is for a comedian to express themselves authentically in India, where it has been repeatedly proven unsafe to do so.\n\nShe acknowledged that it is disheartening to watch comedians be vilified in the public eye for their jokes, which is exacerbated by the fact that there are so many other issues that deserve equal if not more attention.\n\nThis is with regard to the comments Ranveer Allahabadia (BeerBiceps) made on a YouTube comedy show recently that elicited a storm of complaints.\n\n“I make jokes on romance and dating, so I figured I’ll be safe from such judgement. But over the years I have learnt that you cannot grow as an artist if you are not free to think and express,” she said, adding that the consequence of doing so in India is often disproportionate to the action.\n\nShe then drew comparisons in creative freedom between stand-comedy and Bollywood, where the formulaic plots have overtaken creative exploration for the sake of box office numbers. “If it works, it works, artistes don’t know how to be creative anymore,” she said.\n\nCoincidentally however, Prashasti said that her plans in the future do include making a foray into Bollywood as a screenwriter.\n\nShe has flirted with the idea a few times but has yet to make the jump. “It is still very recent, the writing ecosystem is starting to realise that even comedians can add value,” she said.\n\n“My biggest strength is when I express myself honestly. I do not want to think about what it is becoming, I want to focus on what it is.”\n\nPrashasti Singh", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/a9f2f18e2ac2803f6cbe575011831e470d62dfcf2dd8d1a012376205470ed60d?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe yellow stands of Chepauk still roar when M.S. Dhoni walks out to bat. The chants of “Thala” still echo long after the match ends. But this season, something feels different. The roars are tinged with worry.\n\nThe chants, though loud, carry questions. And most painfully for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) fans, their icon – MS Dhoni – is no longer the answer to their problems. He might just be one of them.\n\nIn the 2025 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), CSK, once the epitome of consistency, calm and championship pedigree, are floundering.\n\nFour losses in five matches. A top order in disarray. A bowling attack missing bite. A team that once thrived on clarity and experience now seems confused and lethargic.\n\nAnd at the centre of this unravelling is Dhoni – not as a saviour, but increasingly, as a symbol of CSK’s struggle to let go of the past.\n\nOn April 5, the crowd at Chepauk, like always, waited for Dhoni to walk out. They got their wish – Dhoni walked in early, with CSK five down and needing 112 off 56 balls.\n\nA few years ago, that would have been the perfect Dhoni scenario. But this wasn’t vintage Dhoni. This was the Dhoni of 2025 – hesitant, physically limited, batting 19 balls for a lone six when the match had already slipped away.\n\nEven former India star and commentator Ravi Shastri, never one to undersell drama, called the six with a disinterested tone, summing up the disconnect.\n\nA few days later, against Punjab Kings, Dhoni seemed back to his old self – three sixes, a charged-up 27 – but it came too late.\n\nWith 28 needed off the final over, he fell on the first ball, unable to produce another fairytale finish. CSK lost again.\n\nThe fortress of Chepauk, once feared by all, has been breached multiple times this season.\n\nHead coach Stephen Fleming admitted that Dhoni “is not in shape to bat for 10 overs”. After knee surgery and now at 43, he’s trained for short bursts.\n\nThe plan was clear – Dhoni as a late-order finisher, not the lynchpin of a chase. But CSK’s misfiring top order has thrown this plan into disarray.\n\nThey have experimented heavily – 17 players in five matches – unsettling the team’s rhythm.\n\nRachin Ravindra, Devon Conway and Rahul Tripathi have failed to click. Ruturaj Gaikwad, promoted to captaincy, has shown flashes of form but lacks Dhoni’s aura and strategic acumen.\n\nThe result? CSK find themselves playing catch-up every game. Dhoni’s late cameos, once thrilling, now feel like afterthoughts – entertaining, yes, but inconsequential.\n\nCSK’s reliance on Dhoni’s presence – for brand, for fan engagement, for leadership – is both their strength and Achilles’ heel.\n\nCommentator Sanjay Manjrekar put it bluntly: “Dhoni’s presence in the team is more for brand value than actual cricketing value.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment echoed by many. Former Mumbai batsman Wasim Jaffer questioned whether Dhoni should even be in the XI if he’s not captaining.\n\nFormer cricketer Manoj Tiwari suggested that Dhoni should have retired after CSK’s 2023 title win. Even Australia great Matthew Hayden has remarked that “Dhoni has lost the cricket; it’s over for him.”\n\nBut this isn’t just about Dhoni. It’s about a franchise that built itself around a philosophy – loyalty, experience, composure – and now finds itself trapped by it. CSK’s famed stability has turned into stagnation.\n\nTo be fair, Dhoni never asked to be the team’s saviour this year. He was retained as a specialist lower-order batter and wicketkeeper.\n\nHis glovework remains elite. He continues to marshal the field and guide Gaikwad from behind the stumps. But the myth of Dhoni – the finisher, the tactician, the miracle worker – continues to overshadow the man.\n\nIn a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Dhoni addressed retirement rumours, saying: “I take it one year at a time. My body will decide.”\n\nBut the murmurs are growing louder. Even Dhoni’s most loyal fans, heartbroken by the team’s decline, are beginning to acknowledge the inevitable.\n\nThe harsh truth is that CSK are stuck. Gaikwad, though promising, isn’t ready to lead a turnaround. Dhoni, while still valuable, cannot carry the team any more.\n\nThe auction strategy backfired. The team lacks firepower, intent, and direction.\n\nIf CSK are to rebuild, it has to begin now – with or without Dhoni. They need to back youth, rethink their playing XI, and perhaps most importantly, detach from nostalgia.\n\nThat includes making tough calls about batting positions, combinations, and legacy players.\n\nAs one fan on X aptly put it: “Dhoni didn’t fail us.

It marked the first and only time he performed as Hero Singh on home soil, though he has since portrayed the character many times in Malaysia.\n\nThis will happen again in Kuala Lumpur in May, with the show re-titled Laugh Die You: Hero Singh – Guilty As Charged.\n\nA snippet of the opening act recently posted on Instagram reveals Hero Singh making a grand entrance, descending from the ceiling on a platform amid fireworks and dancers grooving to Bollywood hits.\n\nGurmit based the character on his late father, Chainchal Singh, who worked as a bank security guard by day and as an overnight jaga or watchman by night.\n\nJaga – Malay for guard – is associated with Singapore’s Sikh community, many of whom took on security roles in the 1960s due to their reliability and strong and imposing presence.\n\nThe fake chest hair plays on the stereotype of hairy Indian men, the twirled moustache adds a false sense of authority and the protruding belly is a tribute to Gurmit’s father.\n\n“When Hero says things like ‘Bastard you!’ it’s what my father would say when he was drunk. And there’s no fear when you hear that. It’s just a throwaway, more of a greeting,” Gurmit explained.\n\nThe distinction between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation lies in intent. Gurmit’s intention is not just to make people laugh but also to honour the generations of men who came before him through good-natured parody rather than mockery.\n\n“My grandpa was a watchman, my father was a watchman. I thought I was going to become a watchman too,” Gurmit said.\n\nAnd for a while, he did. With his father juggling two security jobs, family time was scarce. So as a teenager, Gurmit spent weekends filling in for his father as an overnight watchman at Bank Negara Indonesia on Malacca Street, near Raffles Place.\n\nOn Saturdays, after his extra-curricular activities at school, he would arrive in the afternoon and take over his father’s post when the bank was about to close. “My dad would pass me the whole bunch of keys and go home,” Gurmit recalled.\n\nWith only a few employees from the computer department still around, they would find a young Gurmit sitting on the hammock-style bed – standard for jagas who stayed overnight at their posts – explaining that his father had gone for a tea break.\n\nOnce the bank emptied out, his job was to lock up and head upstairs to shut off the main generator for the building’s air conditioning.\n\n“It was on the fourth floor and that floor scared me because it was just an alleyway, dark with a dingy light. I didn’t know this at first but the building would contract in the cold and start expanding once the aircon was off. Then you would hear crackling sounds and the hair on my arms would stand.”\n\nAfter that terrifying ordeal, the teenager would spend the rest of the day watching television in the lobby until around 7pm, when his family – father, mother and two younger sisters – would join him at the bank for dinner before settling in for the night.\n\n“My mum and dad would sleep on the bed, while my sisters and I had three thin mattresses or blankets. We could sleep anywhere, so we’d sleep on the carpeted area in the admin office,” Gurmit recalled.\n\n“Once, I even slept in the computer room because one of the computer guys had a tape player in his drawer, so I could listen to a tape before falling asleep. There was a time the three of us slept right in front of the vault, in front of this giant steel door. Once in a while, I’d pray for it to open – just open, please.”\n\nThe next morning, the family would have breakfast before leaving, while Gurmit remained behind. He would spend the day watching television until lunchtime, then head out to buy nasi lemak, vadai or murukku before quickly returning. By 7pm on Sunday, his father would return to resume his post.\n\n“That was my childhood. Growing up, the weekends in my teenage years were spent in the bank.”\n\nHis childhood experiences instilled in him a deep desire to provide a comfortable life for his family. And he did, but he mistakenly believed that earning a high salary and financially supporting his family was the same as being present for them.\n\nGurmit eventually found himself disconnected from his family due to his busy schedule and realised he was repeating the same cycle his father had done with him.\n\nHe then decided to leave his full-time role at Mediacorp in 2014 to focus on his family – his wife Melissa Wong, a polytechnic lecturer, and their son and two daughters.\n\nHe still performs live comedy and makes occasional appearances in entertainment projects.\n\nThrough Hero Singh, Gurmit pays homage to his father and the countless Sikh men who took on the demanding yet understated role of jaga.\n\nBy embodying the character with warmth, humour and a touch of absurdity, he transforms a once-familiar figure into an entertaining, nostalgic and relatable persona for audiences.\n\nHe is the watchman who became Singapore’s beloved funnyman. In doing so, Gurmit has successfully broken the generational cycle while honouring the men who came before him.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nParents’ love story\n\nOf Chinese and Japanese descent, Gurmit’s mother was adopted and raised by a Sikh couple who named her Dip Kaur.\n\nShe spoke fluent Punjabi and practiced Sikhism.\n\n“The moment my father saw her walk through the temple door, he was in love,” Gurmit said. Too shy to express it, Chainchal Singh wrote poems in Punjabi, passing them to Dip through a mutual friend.\n\nThe romantic Chainchal went to a photo studio to have Dip’s face superimposed onto his photo because she would always be in his heart. Unlike today, it was costly to edit photos but it showed the depth of his affection for her. The lovebirds married, and the rest is history.\n\nGurmit was raised in a fully Indian household. “I knew I looked different. I challenged my mother growing up and asked why we did not look like the other Punjabis at the temple,” he said.\n\nHe even asked to see her birth certificate, which stated she was Indian and Punjabi. “I knew deep down something was off, but mum never told us. It was only after she passed away that my dad told me the story.”\n\nHis mother would concoct simple dishes, like rice and potatoes with black sauce, as the family could not afford much else.\n\nHowever, on special occasions like Deepavali, when the family could afford to spend a little more, she would cook up a storm.\n\n“We would sit on the floor as the table was not big enough. Her signature dishes included sambal sotong, curry chicken, and a fried egg omelette like those in nasi lemak. She also made golden coins – crispy, deep-fried potatoes – along with chapati, biryani rice, lamb and dhal makhani!”\n\n“Every other dhal is dull compared to her dhal,” Gurmit quipped.\n\nHis mother died in 2001 at 58, followed two years later by his father at 70.\n\nBoth succumbed to cancer.\n\nGurmit with his parents and sisters.\n\nPhoto: Gurmit Singh\n\nChainchal Singh with Dip Kaur placed over his heart.\n\nPhoto: Gurmit Singh\n\nSingaporean’s beloved funnyman Gurmit Singh\n\nPhoto: Berita Harian\n\n“My grandpa was a watchman, my father was a watchman.

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingapore’s theatre aficionados are in for a rare cultural treat, as legendary Indian poet and lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi’s life story unfolds on stage in the much-acclaimed play Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon.\n\nThe evocative production, directed and performed by acclaimed actor and storyteller Danish Husain, will be staged at the Victoria Theatre on April 11 at 7pm.\n\nBrought to Singapore by Limelight Arts, Action Replay – Events & Entertainment and Vmall Entertainment, the play has already captivated audiences in Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad.\n\nIt continues to receive critical acclaim for its rich storytelling, soulful music and nuanced portrayal of Sahir – a poet whose verses remain etched in the collective memory of generations.\n\nSahir, who died in 1980, is known for his hauntingly beautiful lyrics in Bollywood films such as Pyaasa, Kabhi Kabhie and Phir Subah Hogi. His poetic voice championed the oppressed and challenged societal injustices, touching on themes like Partition, poverty, love and secularism.\n\nThrough Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon, audiences are invited not just to witness Sahir’s life, but to experience his ideals, contradictions and unwavering commitment to truth.\n\n“His relevance has not diminished – in fact, it’s more important now than ever to rediscover him,” says Husain, who plays Sahir in the production.\n\nThe play originated during the 11th anniversary celebrations of Husain’s theatre company, Hoshruba Repertory, at Mumbai’s iconic Prithvi Theatre. Creative producer Amita Talwar approached Husain with a script on Sahir’s life by United States-based writer Mir Ali Husain.\n\n“It was beautiful, but written as a monologue,” Husain recalls. To deepen the narrative, he combined it with elements from Dastan-e-Sahir, a theatrical storytelling piece by noted dastango Himanshu Bajpai.\n\nThe result is a multi-layered experience: one part of the stage shows Sahir in his study, giving a reflective interview, while the other half recreates a 1970s recording studio where musicians gossip, reminisce and perform Sahir’s iconic songs.\n\nThis dual narrative captures both the public legacy and the private vulnerabilities of the poet.\n\nThe play interweaves Sahir’s story with renditions of his most beloved songs, including “Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon” and “Ye Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaye Toh Kya Hai”.\n\nLive music by artistes like Shantanu Herlekar (music director and disciple of Shubha Mudgal), vocalist Srijonee Bhattacharya and percussionist Siddharth Padiyar elevates the performance into an immersive experience.\n\n“The audience doesn’t just watch,” says Husain. “They sing along, weep, and laugh – they become part of Sahir’s world.”\n\nWhile many remember Sahir as a romantic lyricist courted by cinema’s most influential women, this play looks deeper – at the man shaped by a troubled childhood, an indomitable mother and a fierce sense of justice.\n\nJoining Husain on stage are a talented ensemble of musicians and actors, including Vrinda Vaid Hayat, Siddharth Padiyar and Donald Krist.\n\nAt its heart, Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon is more than a biographical play – it is a tribute to poetry, resistance, and the power of staying true to one’s voice.\n\n“We don’t deify or condemn Sahir,” says Husain. “We present him as he was – layered, flawed, principled and deeply human.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e0135be6c88d790bf3d73348f86b9594798ed5636bb416bffaf0a8286e7b79b8?w=825", "alt_text": "Actor Danish Husain plays legendary Indian poet and lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi in the play Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon."}]}

I speak from experience.\n\nI was the driver 25 years ago when I first came to Singapore and, when my nephew Krishnan recently visited us on his first holiday outside Indian, I was the observer.\n\nAs I drove him from Changi airport, he gushed about the size and smoothness of the road, and the quality (high) and quantity (low) of cars on it.\n\nI smiled and said: “My father used to say, with remarkable authority for a man who had never set foot outside India, ‘If you can drive in India, you can drive anywhere in the world’.”\n\n“I have brought my driving licence with me,” said Krishnan immediately.\n\nI can take a hint as well as the next man. “Do you want to drive?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded vigorously and unbuckled his seat belt. I asked him to buckle up again and explained that we could not change places in the middle of the ECP.\n\nHe gave me a look in which disappointment and disapproval were so neatly conveyed that I could read his thoughts: If you didn’t want me to drive your car, why did you ask the question?\n\nI understood his scepticism because things are more flexible in India.\n\nForty years ago, in the Ambassador’s single sofa-like front seat, I remember us effecting such changes without even stopping the car.\n\nPassenger clambers over driver; driver releases foot from accelerator; driver quickly slides into the passenger seat; and Bob’s your uncle. I assured him he’d get to sit at the wheel.\n\nAs he did that later in the day, a beatific smile adorned Krishnan’s face. Then he frowned.\n\n“So many lines – so confusing!” he said. “These yellow ones on the side – some single, some double, some going straight, some going zigzag down the road, like my friend Subbu after three drinks.”\n\nI said: “I too was initially confused by the yellow fellows. Let me explain: A single yellow line signals it’s the edge of the road..”\n\nKrishnan butted in: “But I can see it’s the edge of the road: the footpath starts there.”\n\nHe was right of course. But in Singapore we like things spelt out super-clearly. That may look like the edge of the road but a yellow line “double confirms” it.\n\nI continued: “A double yellow line means you can drop someone off but cannot park; a zigzag line means you cannot even drop someone; a double zigzag…”\n\n“Let me guess,” he said. “You cannot even contemplate the idea of thinking about perhaps stopping.”\n\nWith his curiosity about the yellow lines sated, he asked about the white ones in the middle of the road – why so many and of such variety: dashed, continuous, single, double, and his confusion deepening, half-dashed, half-continuous.\n\nI explained the concept of driving within lanes unless overtaking.\n\nHis face took on the look of a forward deprived of the football by a vigilant defender with the goal only 20 metres away. I could empathise.\n\nIn India we drive on whichever part of the road we fancy, or more accurately, where there’s space, and if an opportunity for overtaking presents itself (as it sometimes does between 1am and 5am), doing it in any direction – right, left, up or down.\n\nWhen I told him that on a lane bordered by a continuous white line, he may not change lanes under any circumstances, he asked: “What if I suddenly see a pothole in front of me?” His triumphant tone suggested he had just bowled a vicious delivery to knock off all three of my stumps.\n\nInstead, I hit the ball for a six. “There are no potholes on Singapore roads.”\n\nThe man was aghast and, for a few minutes, speechless.\n\nWe were moving slowly as Krishnan absorbed all this education. But at this point we came behind a car going even slower. He immediately sounded the horn a few times.\n\n“What are you doing?” I screamed.\n\n“Sounding the horn,” he explained, and honked a few more times for good measure.\n\nI caught his hand and told him that you don’t honk to tell someone you’re behind them, that they use their side mirror to deduce this on their own. Once again, he looked shocked; both man and horn became silent.\n\nLater, when I asked him how he’d enjoyed driving in Singapore, he responded enthusiastically.\n\nBut travelling with him had made me reminiscence nostalgically about driving in India, where you compete aggressively for space with pedestrians, cycles, scooters, auto-rickshaws, cars, buses and jumbo trailer trucks on madly busy roads; buy a snack or a novel from a vendor at an intersection; eat and read afore-mentioned snack and book at the next intersection; skirt potholes; miss skirting potholes and experience a theme-park-like exhilaration; and of course, honk.\n\nAt signals, the car at the front of the line is sometimes slow on the uptake. In Singapore those behind wait, impatient but silent.\n\nIn India, the definition of a split second is the time between the signal turning green and the first horn blasting. That front car is galvanised into motion.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/38b8b4ceac4ba3bc5520cbc6f5d7e5438946c7f37bda92942296970bb15cabf0?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nTwo recent plays by Singaporean theatre companies addressed the Partition of India and Pakistan. One of them, Train to Pakistan, was attended by Pakistan High Commissioner to Singapore Rabia Shafiq.\n\nReflecting on it, she said the play was “nicely made” and offered audiences a powerful portrayal of history. “Many people in Singapore aren’t familiar with the Partition, so such stories help them understand what really happened and the human stories behind it,” she said.\n\nHowever, Madam Rabia emphasised that, while conflicts like Gaza and Ukraine differ politically from the Partition, there are broader lessons to learn.\n\n“The key takeaway is that once the turmoil settles, the focus must be on development and improving lives,” she said, drawing a parallel to Singapore’s own history and growth after separation from Malaysia.\n\nHighlighting Pakistan’s journey since its independence over 75 years ago, Madam Rabia noted the nation’s roots in agriculture, with major development in infrastructure, including dams and electricity generation.\n\nShe said efforts are ongoing to develop the manufacturing and services sectors, and with more than 60 per cent of Pakistan’s 240 million population under 30, human capital is a key focus. “Equipping youth for the economy and improving health and education are central goals,” she said.\n\nWhile referring to negative perceptions of Pakistan, Madam Rabia admitted to economic and security challenges, partly due to the country’s geographic location.\n\n“But many countries face challenges,” she said, pointing out Pakistan’s functioning democracy, independent judiciary, vibrant media and resilient people. “Despite inflation or difficulties, Pakistanis remain passionate about life, from cricket to food. That resilience is our strength.”\n\nAddressing concerns about travel to Pakistan, Madam Rabia encouraged Singaporeans to speak to those who have visited.\n\n“Pakistan offers diverse terrain, from the northern mountains to ancient civilisations like Gandhara and Mehrgarh,” she said.\n\nReligious and adventure tourism are growing, with visitors from Europe and Japan frequently visiting Buddhist and Sikh sites. “Security systems are in place, and like in any country, basic precautions ensure a good trip,” she added.\n\nHer personal favourite is Gilgit-Baltistan. “I was awestruck – it’s magical. Photos don’t do it justice,” she said. The High Commissioner also recommended major cities like Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, each offering unique cultural and culinary experiences.\n\nMadam Rabia grew up in Islamabad, completing her schooling, college and university there. She joined the Foreign Service in 2001, after earning degrees in business and public administration.\n\nAfter a brief internship in banking, she realised it wasn’t for her. “I come from a family of doctors, lawyers and engineers. No one in my family was in government, so becoming a diplomat wasn’t planned. Life led me there.”\n\nShe finds her diplomatic work rewarding, despite the challenges of being away from family. “It gives you a sense of purpose – you represent your country and strive to bring benefits back.”\n\nAbout 30 per cent of Pakistan’s foreign service officers are women, with about a dozen serving as ambassadors globally. “That’s a strong presence and a positive sign.”\n\nMadam Rabia arrived in Singapore in June 2024, marking her first ambassadorial posting. With Pakistan and Singapore completing 60 years of diplomatic ties in 2026, she sees great potential to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\n“One priority is leadership level political engagement,” she said, noting a lack of high-level visits between the two countries in recent years. “I’m working to revive that.”\n\nEconomically, she’s focused on increasing food and halal meat exports, expanding agricultural trade, and positioning Pakistan as an outsourcing destination in IT, finance and accounting. “Singapore needs skilled professionals, and Pakistan has the talent.”\n\nMadam Rabia also sees opportunities for collaboration in climate change adaptation, where Singapore’s expertise in waste management and sustainability could benefit Pakistan, a country highly vulnerable to climate-related disasters.\n\nHuman capital development is another area where she believes Pakistan can learn from Singapore’s efficiency and innovation.\n\nOn life in Singapore, she said: “It’s an easy place to be. You don’t feel like an outsider. The diversity and safety are very appealing.”\n\nShe enjoys walking, badminton, and is currently learning to swim. She also appreciates the variety of food and products available. Her favourite local dish? “Singaporean noodles!”\n\nWhen asked what she’d like to take back to Pakistan, she highlighted Singapore’s greenery – even in urban architecture – and digital services. “The SingPass app is impressive. It simplifies government services. I’d love to see something like that in Pakistan.”\n\nThe Pakistani community in Singapore is about 5,000 strong. “They’re very active, and I attend their events whenever possible,” she said, adding that the Singapore Pakistan Association is a valuable bridge between cultures.\n\n“Singapore is an easy place to be.

The original name was seen as a direct reference to Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi, who was convicted in connection with the 2002 Gujarat riots.\n\nAdditionally, the display card marking the film’s timeline as “2002-India” has been revised to the more vague “A few years ago”.\n\nScenes depicting graphic violence against women, visuals of bodies and a board showing “NIA” on a vehicle were also removed.\n\nOther deleted elements include conversations between characters Zayed Masood and his father, and a “thanks” credit to Union Minister of State and actor Suresh Gopi.\n\nOne of the more contentious characters, Zayed Masood – played by Prithviraj himself – was criticised for his resemblance to terrorist Masood Azhar, the founder of the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nThe right-wing publication Organiser accused the film of justifying terrorism as a response to communal violence, calling the narrative “dangerous” and “divisive”.\n\nThe film’s producers maintain that the decision to make cuts was voluntary. “We did not do this under any pressure,” said producer Antony Perumbavoor on Tuesday. “If anyone feels offended, it is our responsibility to make corrections. We are not here to hurt sentiments.”\n\nHe also denied reports of internal disagreement among the filmmakers and defended Mohanlal’s involvement, stating that the actor was fully aware of the film’s script and content.\n\nThis was in response to claims by actor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Major Ravi, who alleged that Mohanlal had not reviewed the film thoroughly before its release.\n\nDespite the cuts, Empuraan continues to perform strongly at the box office, setting records for a Malayalam-language film both in India and overseas. Its success comes despite mixed critical reviews.\n\nThe Hindustan Times described it as a film “grappling with an identity crisis,” while The Indian Express praised Mohanlal’s performance but criticised the film for lacking the emotional depth of its predecessor.\n\nThe political backlash, primarily from BJP and right-wing groups, led to a wider debate about freedom of artistic expression. While some BJP leaders insisted that no official campaign was mounted against the film, the sharp reactions on social media and in media outlets like Organiser indicate widespread disapproval in certain circles.\n\nNonetheless, political leaders from Kerala, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Opposition Leader V.D. Satheesan, voiced their support for the film and condemned the attacks against it.\n\nWith the updated version now in theatres, the filmmakers are looking ahead to the third and final installment of the Lucifer trilogy. “We will definitely go ahead with the next film,” confirmed Perumbavoor.\n\n“We did not do \nthis (make \nthe cuts) under any pressure.

It also hosts a PhD programme in energy and sustainability. The curriculum mirrors IIT Delhi’s standards, focusing on industry collaboration and global trends.\n\nCurrently located in Khalifa City B, IITD-AD’s transit campus includes cutting-edge academic, research and residential facilities. The first batch includes 53 undergraduate, 17 postgraduate and seven PhD students.\n\n“Singaporeans and Indian expatriates in Singapore are encouraged to consider IITD-AD for its multicultural setting, global partnerships and proximity,” said Prof Abhyankar. “IITD-AD integrates Indian academic excellence with international exposure.”\n\nAdmissions to undergraduate programmes are via two routes: the JEE Advanced, open to all nationalities, and CAET 2025, an exclusive entrance exam for IITD-AD.\n\nSingapore is one of the international centres for CAET.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThree women from India – Madhuri Sahasrabudhe, Avanti Dixit and Urmila Joshi – arrived in Singapore last month on a mission that spans continents and cultures.\n\nTheir goal? To study the evolving role of motherhood in families across the globe through a project titled Mothers on Wheels Out to Heal the World.\n\nTheir journey, which began on March 4 in Bhutan, will cover 10 countries. The Singapore leg follows a re-route – they had initially planned to drive through Bangladesh and Myanmar but changed course due to political instability in both countries.\n\nInstead, they flew into Singapore from Chennai on March 19. Their vehicle, a Tata Harrier SUV, is set to arrive by ship today. Once it docks, they’ll continue their expedition overland through South-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThis is their second transnational journey. The first was in 2018, a road trip from Delhi to London across 22 countries. That journey saw them meet over 300 mothers and sparked deep insights into global parenting cultures.\n\nThe Mothers on Wheels initiative is spearheaded by the Foundation for Holistic Development, a non-profit headquartered in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. It has operations in 18 Indian states and works with volunteers rather than formal members, with a core mission of strengthening “Matha Shakti” – the power of motherhood.\n\nAccording to Madam Madhuri, the foundation’s genesis was in her experiences in the Kashmir Valley. In 2016, she observed how few boys were attending school and began personally visiting villages to motivate students.\n\nWith the help of government scholarship schemes and sustained engagement with students and their families, her work helped over 3,000 young people pursue higher education outside Kashmir.\n\n“What I learnt was the impact of a motherly approach,” she said. “When spoken to with affection, children truly listen.”\n\nHer experiences also revealed a deeper concern: The invisibility of mothers in some communities. “In Kashmir, mothers were absent from conversations. They were hidden away. That triggered me,” she said.\n\nAnother pivotal moment was the 2012 Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi. Madam Madhuri was troubled by the public defence mounted by the juvenile perpetrator’s mother. “What values had he grown up with?” she asked. “And what role did the mother play in shaping those values?”\n\nIt was then that the idea of studying motherhood itself – as a social institution – was born.\n\nIn 2018, Madam Madhuri and Madam Urmila, along with Madam Sheetal Deshpande and Madam Madhavi Singh Tomar, embarked on their first road trip: Delhi to London via 22 countries, 47 cities, and over 23,000 kilometres.\n\nTheir findings surprised them.\n\n“Everywhere we went, mothers were taken for granted,” Madam Urmila said. “Governments talk about maternal health and nutrition, but the emotional and value-driven role of a mother is overlooked.”\n\nTheir journey culminated in an international conference back in India, where 32 mothers from eight countries, including Nepal, Germany, Iran and Kazakhstan, visited India to witness the Indian family system up close.\n\n“One German mother cried after watching a 75-year-old man touch the feet of his 92-year-old mother,” Madam Madhuri recalled. “She said she was scared to even speak to her 10-year-old child.”\n\nAfter landing in Singapore on March 19, the group met 70 mothers – 50 of them Singaporean  Indians and the rest Singaporean Malay and Chinese – in two weeks. They also engaged with community organisations such as the Vivekananda Seva Sangh and parents from the Overseas Family School.\n\nWhat they found was a society wrestling with familiar challenges: declining marriage rates, rising numbers of single mothers, and increasing divorce rates.\n\nMothers on Wheels have heard stories from local mothers about parenting in dual-income households, struggles with emotional connection, and concerns about youth growing up in emotionally detached environments.\n\n“Spending quality time and nurturing open communication with children fosters confidence, emotional well-being and strong family bonds,” said Ms Maithilee Kale, a mother who participated in one of the discussions. “In Singapore, many dual-income households rely on day care or domestic help, which may impact children’s formative growth.\n\n“Intentional parenting and presence are essential to support children’s holistic development and prevent low self-esteem stemming from lack of attention.”\n\nSingaporean Chinmayee Bhandari, a working mother of a school-going boy, opened up about the daily struggle of balancing motherhood and work responsibilities.\n\n“It’s difficult to fulfil all the roles of a mother with so many meetings and events scheduled throughout the day. I have to find time during the projects I’m working on,” she said.\n\nMs Chinmayee was deeply moved by the mission of the Mothers on Wheels team. “Meeting them was very inspiring. It’s unbelievable what they are doing. They are exchanging information and studying the changing role of mothers. They are on the road, travelling to different places to understand what needs to be done to keep motherhood strong.”\n\nHowever, the three-member team stressed that these are early insights. A formal study is underway using structured questionnaires. “We’ve created detailed forms that we plan to distribute widely,” said Madam Madhuri. “We aim to collect about 100 responses from Singapore alone before drawing conclusions.”\n\nOnce the entire journey is complete, data from each country will be compiled, analysed and presented in an international conference in India later this year. Mothers from all visited countries will be invited to share their research papers and participate in cross-cultural dialogues.\n\n“Last time, we lacked proper data collection. This time we’re better prepared,” said Madam Avanti. “Our ultimate goal is to create a global platform for mothers to collaborate and share insights.”\n\nBack in India, the team is running a parallel initiative: Matrutva Shakti Ka Tandav. Through this programme, mothers across India learn the true meaning of motherhood and why a mother’s role is so important in a family.\n\nThe idea, says Madam Urmila, is to reconnect mothers with their traditional roles – not to restrict them, but to empower them with identity and value.\n\nModern challenges like children refusing marriage, avoiding parenthood or struggling with relationships are all part of the dialogue.\n\n“Children today don’t understand sharing. They don’t understand relationships,” said Madam Avanti. “That’s because they’re growing up in nuclear families with minimal interaction.”\n\nThe answer, she says, lies in both tradition and dialogue. “We’re not advocating a return to the past. We’re proposing a rethinking of the future – with the mother at the centre.”\n\nMothers on Wheels during their India to UK trip in 2018.\n\nPhoto: Mothers on Wheels\n\n“Everywhere we went, mothers were taken for granted.

Santosh Kumar\n\nThe Singapore Cricket Club (SCC) marked a spectacular celebration of sport and national pride last weekend with its Independence Cup matches at the iconic Padang, featuring high-quality men’s and women’s encounters between Singapore Combined XIs and SCC representative teams.\n\nThe men’s match was held on March 30 and 31, while a Twenty20 match between the women’s teams was played on March 29.\n\n“We came up with the Independence Cup to celebrate Singapore’s 60th birthday and to showcase the best cricketing talent in the country,” said Krishna Natarajan, convener of cricket at SCC. “We chose the Padang because it has deep historical significance – it’s where the first cricket match in Singapore was played 188 years ago. As a club, we’re proud of our heritage as guardians of cricket and this historic ground.”\n\nThe men’s Independence Cup was a rare two-day fixture between SCC XI and Singapore Combined XI (SG XI) – a format not played in Singapore for several years.\n\nSG XI won the toss and batted first but struggled on a slow turf pitch. They were reduced to 22-5 within nine overs due to sharp spells from Harsh Venkataram (4-14) and Riaan Naik (2-29).\n\nA late partnership between Ishaan Sawhney (41 not out) and Kashif Ali (33) lifted them to 115 all out. Akshay Puri also picked up four wickets (4-31).\n\nIn response, SCC XI also faltered, slumping to 50-5, before captain Aritra Dutta (58) led a spirited fightback. Despite his efforts, they fell short, all out for 107, conceding an eight-run first innings lead.\n\nSG XI began their second innings cautiously, ending Day 1 at 31-4.\n\nOn Day 2, contributions from Manpreet Singh (23), Sawhney (22) and Mason Sherry (23) took SG XI to 135, setting SCC a target of 144. SCC left-arm spinner Aslan Jafri took 3-15.\n\nSCC’s chase was led by Aritra (34), Riaan (28), and a match-winning, unbeaten 54 from Aman Desai. SCC reached the target with seven wickets in hand in just 23 overs.\n\nPacer Harsh, 17, who claimed six wickets across both innings, was named man of the match.\n\n“The game see-sawed over two days and was challenging due to the unfamiliar format,” said Dutta. “We held our own against a strong SCA side and this match helped me grow as a national player.”\n\nThe Women’s T20 match saw SG Women’s XI bowled out for 89 in 17.5 overs. SCC Women’s XI chased down the target in 18.5 overs, finishing at 90-7 to seal a tight win.\n\nDiviya G K, former national captain and SCC skipper, was named player of the match.\n\n“It was a close game, but the girls prevailed,” said Diviya. “Our squad is young and needs more exposure. We’re proud to contribute to the growth of women’s cricket in Singapore.”\n\nThe matches featured national players, emerging youth talent, and brought back the longer form of the game – a rare opportunity in Singapore’s predominantly T20 landscape.\n\n“Developing cricket, especially youth and women’s cricket, is a core objective at SCC,” said Riaz Hussein, SCC Captain of Cricket and former national player. “These matches were competitive and played in great spirit.

Trains run on time, food arrives in minutes and even the haze knows when to come and go.\n\nBut, within this well-oiled machine, there exists an equally well-honed art – tai chi.\n\nNo, not the graceful martial art where Boomer uncles do slow-motion moves at the park. This is Singapore-style tai chi – the fine art of deflecting responsibility and pushing the blame onto someone else.\n\nIn the local context, tai chi doesn’t mean balancing your energy – it means balancing your excuses. It’s when someone subtly shifts responsibility onto an unsuspecting victim – like a human game of passing-the-parcel where the prize is the “blame”.\n\nEveryone, from your boss to your husband has mastered it.\n\nIt’s a highly evolved skill which produces tai chi experts of different levels and forms. Some practitioners are subtle, others are grandmasters of deflection. Here are some I know of:\n\nThe ‘I was just following instructions’ type\n\nThis person never takes independent action. No matter what happens, the response is:\n\n“Boss said one.”\n\n“The system is like that.”\n\n“MOH rules, not me.”\n\nYou can never pin the blame on them. They just follow law lah!\n\nThe ‘Let’s form a committee’ master\n\nSome people will never take the blame – they spread it out:\n\n“Let’s discuss this at the next meeting.”\n\n“Let’s get a task force to review it.”\n\n“Let’s wait for further instructions.”\n\nFrom whom? For what? By the time a decision is made, the problem has solved itself – or become someone else’s problem.\n\nThe ‘Blame anything in your sight’ genius\n\nWhen all else fails, he blames external forces:\n\nLate for work? “Rain was too heavy.”\n\nSales are bad? “The economy is like that.”\n\nYour kid is rude? “TikTok’s fault.”\n\nLost money in stocks? “Because of Musk. What to do?”\n\nThese people are untouchable. Nothing is ever their fault.\n\nTai Chi friends: The sneaky deflectors\n\nFriends never openly fight. Instead, they gracefully pass blame like they are in a Bollywood dance sequence.\n\nYou rush to meet your friends for lunch. The restaurant is packed.\n\nMona: “Daisy, it’s full ! You were supposed to make the reservation!”\n\nKavita\n\n:\n\n“Yes, I offered, but then you insisted, so I let you.”\n\nAnu: “You’re becoming very forgetful these days! Now what? I’m famished!”\n\nMe: (On the back foot) Really? Did I?\n\nI beg and implore and get a table. Lunch done. The bill arrives.\n\nAnu: “I thought Rekha was treating us for her birthday?”\n\nRekha: “No, no, birthday was last week, yaar. We said we’d split!”\n\nKavita: “Did we? I thought we’d decided on ‘whoever loses at rummy’ pays!”\n\nAll: “Daisy!”\n\nDaisy: “Wait, I lost? So now I’m paying?” (strained laughter)\n\nYour friends are never wrong. Just grin and bear the blame.\n\nTai chi at home: The domestic dodge\n\nWhen it comes to household chores, tai chi levels reach Olympic standards.\n\nHusband: “Did you pay the utility bill?”\n\nWife: “I thought you were handling that.”\n\nHusband: “You always do it.”\n\nWife: “Ya, but YOU are actually paying for it, no?”\n\nHusband: “So?”\n\nWife: “Are you wearing the pants in this house or am I?”\n\nBoom. The bill is unpaid and the husband is to blame.\n\nKitty party tai chi: The blame game in sarees\n\nEveryone wants to attend the kitty party, but never host it.\n\nRekha: “I thought Mona would do it this time.”\n\nMona: “No, no, Sangeeta said she would.”\n\nSangeeta: “Ya, but only if Preeti couldn’t!”\n\nPreeti: “I assumed our new member, Nisha, would volunteer.”\n\nNisha: “Wait… this is my first party!”\n\nAnd just like that, Nisha is now hosting.\n\nThe ultimate tai chi move: Blame the government\n\nFinally, if all else fails, there is one move that always works. When no one wants to take responsibility, blame the government.\n\nToo many cars on the road? ERP, COE, LTA policy.\n\nHawker food prices rising? Trump’s tariffs.\n\nMRT delayed? Signal fault.\n\nBlaming government is the safest tai chi move globally. No one will argue, and everyone nods in agreement.\n\nWhy do we let tai chi happen?\n\nThe problem is we don’t confront tai chi artistes. Why? Because confronting someone is too troublesome.\n\nDo we want to argue? No.\n\nDo we want a long debate? No.\n\nDo we want a drama? Definitely no.\n\nSo, we sigh, shake our heads, and get tai chied!\n\nFinal thought: Can we ever escape tai chi?\n\nProbably not. It’s too deeply embedded in our survival instinct. In our “cover your backside” attitude. Tai chi is in our DNA.\n\nAnyway, next time you see someone masterfully pushing the blame, don’t get mad. Take a moment to appreciate the grace, skill and technique involved.\n\nAnd, if someone tries to pass blame onto you? No worries. Simply smile and tai chi it forward.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6f976a6532503c32befb5157d6946256ce84a40f4b38ddf9a7a641561c1acd5d?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The official trailer, released on Netflix India’s YouTube channel on March 25, has amassed nearly 10 million views.\n\nA conversation between the three leads opens the trailer as Nayanthara’s character recalls how she and her husband – played by Madhavan, who effortlessly embodies the everyman role – first met at one of Arjun’s Test matches, with Siddharth portraying the cricketer.

The train ride also serves as a metaphor for his anxiety, growing pains and shattered expectations from trying to land his first job.\n\nZakir shot to fame in 2012 after winning Comedy Central’s India’s Best Stand Up competition.

By age three, she was training regularly, performing workouts alongside older students, and mastering the fundamentals of taekwondo.\n\nIn August 2024, she received her black belt from the World Taekwondo Headquarters in South Korea, making her eligible to pursue an instructor certification.\n\nFor the Guinness record, she had to demonstrate full knowledge of taekwondo poomsae – a comprehensive syllabus involving blocks, punches, kicks and self-defence – as well as the ability to teach young students.\n\nAfter an extensive review of training and teaching videos, GWR confirmed her title in November 2024.\n\n“I feel proud standing as an instructor before kids of my age,” said Samyuktha. “Sometimes, I even learn from them!”\n\nHer daily routine is as disciplined as any elite athlete, reported the Hindustan Times. She wakes at 5.30am to train, then heads to Mahatma School, where she is a third-grade student. After finishing her homework, she returns to the academy in the evening to teach a batch of 5- to 6-year-olds.\n\nHer commitment to health is equally strict: no junk food or soft drinks. “I prefer home-cooked food and my mother’s snacks,” she said.\n\nSamyuktha’s achievement has turned her into a local celebrity. “After I received my GWR title, I got so many congratulations from friends, teachers and family. My photos were in the papers and on TV. I felt like a star in my city,” she said proudly.\n\nWhile the online community celebrated her with messages like “exceptional” and “truly inspiring,” others expressed concern over her young age.\n\nSome questioned whether such intense training could pose risks, but Samyuktha’s structured routine and parental supervision appear to provide the right balance between discipline and care.\n\nBeyond martial arts, Samyuktha is a bundle of energy. She is also an avid Western dancer, having won awards at various competitions. “My mother is a bharatanatyam dancer too,” she said.\n\nSamyuktha has now set her sights on representing India in international taekwondo championships, with dreams of winning an Olympic medal. She’s also preparing for another potential Guinness World Record in the fitness category.\n\nHer advice to other young children: “Believe in yourself and your dreams. With discipline, you can achieve anything.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/975cedcaf665b7be0542a24d6bb79370f5fe901369d9f4c4487bf927ea37d720?w=825", "alt_text": "Samyuktha Narayanan taking part in a grading competition in Madurai."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\n36 thosais and more in 68 minutes\n\nOn a humid Friday afternoon, under the warm lights of the iconic MTR restaurant in Little India, Singapore’s most famous food gladiator, Zermatt Neo, did something utterly jaw-dropping.\n\nHe polished off a staggering 36 thosais in 68 minutes, along with an avalanche of other South Indian dishes.\n\nAnd I was there to witness it, surrounded by the clatter of cameras, the gasps of onlookers and the hum of disbelief.\n\nZermatt, the 37-year-old Singaporean competitive eater and social media sensation, is no stranger to viral food challenges. But even by his sky-high standards, this was something special.\n\nWearing his trademark quiet focus and a hungry grin, Zermatt attacked the feast with surgical precision:\n\n• 10 podi masala thosais\n\n• 10 masala thosais\n\n• 5 set thosais\n\n• 1 godhi thosai\n\n• 2 plates of podi idli\n\n• 3 plates of chilli bhaji\n\n• 2 bowls of bisibele bath\n\n• 1 curd rice\n\nAnd a selection of chutneys, sagoos, raitas, lassis and lemonades.\n\nThat’s more than 7kg of food, drenched in 1.6kg of ghee, consumed in just over an hour.\n\n“I chose MTR because so many of my Indian followers kept recommending it,” Zermatt told me post-feast, still glowing – not from sweat, but what can only be described as thosai bliss. “They said this was the place to try real South Indian food. I went for it on my own free will, and they were right.”\n\nIndeed, MTR, which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary globally and 12th in Singapore, is no average restaurant. Known for its no-shortcut approach – no preservatives, no chemicals just good-old freshly ground masalas and batters – it draws loyalists from across cultures.\n\n“About 30 per cent of our podi thosais are eaten by Chinese customers,” said MTR manager Srinivasa Satish Rao. “But this is the first time I’ve seen anyone eat 36 thosais in one go. Zermatt was smiling throughout. Incredible.”\n\nIt wasn’t just thosais. Zermatt had never tried some of these varieties before. “I’ve had thosai before,” he said, “but not like this. The spices, the ghee, the textures – buttery, crispy, hot. It’s an experience. You can tell there’s love in every fold of the thosai.”\n\nAnd yet, watching him eat was hypnotic. Calm, composed, surgical. I couldn’t help but ask: How does one even do this?\n\nZermatt laughed and told me: “It’s years of training. I started off with a 2kg capacity. I’ve worked up to 9kg now. Before and after each challenge, I fast for 24 hours to reset my body.”\n\nWhat about health?\n\n“I go for full health checks every six months. My biomarkers are top 2 to 5 per cent. My doctor says I’m healthier than 90 per cent of Singaporeans.”\n\nIf it all sounds impossible, you should know this: Zermatt is not your average mukbanger (someone who consumes copious amounts of food on camera). With a ripped physique, a Tesla parked outside, and more than 2.2 million YouTube subscribers and a total of 4.5 million TikTok, Instagram and Facebook followers, he’s a brand.\n\nHe juggles nutrition knowledge, gym routines and travel schedules to pursue what he calls “performative gastronomy”.\n\nAt MTR, the audience of about 15 – including three camera operators, restaurant staff and curious patrons like me, drawn to the spectacle by the manager’s invitation – watched with rapt attention as he gulped down thosai after thosai, mixing technique with pure willpower.\n\nWhat happens when you hit your limit?\n\n“You feel the flavours start to repeat, so I use tricks – mango lassi to cleanse the palate, honey lemon to lighten things. That helps reset the taste buds,” he said.\n\nMTR’s famed masala podi thosai was his favourite. “Perfect balance. The crispy exterior, the fluffy interior, the spicy potatoes – chef’s kiss,” he said.\n\nZermatt’s eating prowess is no fluke. He holds world records for devouring 92 chicken wings in eight minutes, 7kg of beef noodles in 15 minutes and 9.5kg of laksa. His recent stint with butter chicken – 4kg chicken, 3kg rice, 1kg naan – went viral.\n\nIndian food, he says, is the heaviest among cuisines. “The ghee, the spices – it hits different. But it’s also the most delicious.”\n\nSo, is this the most thosais anyone has ever eaten in a single sitting?\n\n“I don’t know,” he said with a chuckle. “But if it is, I’d be happy to break my own record next time.”\n\nSpectator and MTR regular Raj Nainani, who claims to have eaten there daily for years, was in awe: “Zermatt did something extraordinary. I Googled it – I think it is a world record.”\n\nBehind the gluttony lies a mind of discipline. Zermatt adheres to intermittent fasting, stacks his post-challenge meals with fibre and probiotics and works out six times a week, focusing on cardio and compound lifts. “I don’t binge every day. It’s planned. It’s science,” he said.\n\nThere’s also deep respect for culture. “My Indian viewers love when I eat with my hands,” he said. “It makes them feel connected. That connection means everything to me.”\n\nZermatt might be a global Internet phenomenon, but on May 23 at MTR Singapore, he was simply a man who loved eating thosais. The watchers clapped. The chefs peeked from the kitchen, stunned. He stood, wiped his hands, and flashed a grin.\n\n“I’m full,” he said.\n\nFull of food, yes. But also full of joy. And for those of us lucky enough to watch, full of wonder.\n\n“I’ve had thosai before, but not like this. The spices, the ghee, the textures – buttery, crispy, hot. It’s an experience. You can tell there’s love in every fold of the thosai.”\n\nZermatt Neo (left)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/19b27a1d101bf7a2d7fa040f334b3463f6878239023db554a8a7672ce39a0641?w=825", "alt_text": "Competitive eater and social media sensation Zermatt Neo preparing to devour a spread of South Indian delicacies at MTR restaurant."}]}

But we don’t talk about the migrant workers who build them.”\n\nAnother insightful painting is that of a migrant domestic worker who came to Singapore with the hopes of becoming a model.\n\nUpon her request not to paint her entire face, Aryan painted a mask that is partially peeled off, revealing eyes that portray a different version of herself.\n\nHis series of paintings titled Silent Dialogues are a reflection of his own inner journey.\n\n“Being silent is also saying something.

I show that in my art through the different shades within monochrome.”\n\nBorn in Saharanpur, India, Aryan came to Singapore in 2017 to study Fine Arts at Lasalle College of the Arts.

Instead, he was handed a life sentence and ordered to pay a fine of Rs50,000 ($758).\n\nThe parcel, neatly wrapped and marked as containing sweets and gifts, was delivered to Mr Sahu’s home in Patnagarh, a small town in Odisha, and appeared to be from Raipur, some 230 kilometers away.\n\nWhen Mr Sahu tugged on the thread to open it, a deadly blast tore through the kitchen, instantly killing him and fatally injuring his aunt.\n\nMs Reema, then just 22, suffered burns, a punctured eardrum and deep psychological scars.\n\nAt first, investigators were baffled, reported the BBC. The bomb had travelled over 650km by bus, passing through several hands before it reached the unsuspecting family. The case went cold – until an anonymous letter reached the Bolangir police chief in April 2018.\n\nThe cryptic letter claimed the bomb had been sent by “SK Sinha”, not “SK Sharma” as written on the courier receipt. It hinted at betrayal and financial motives, suggesting involvement by multiple people who were now “beyond police reach”.\n\nThis odd detail about the misread name on the receipt caught the attention of police officer Arun Bothra, then head of Odisha’s crime branch. He realised only someone closely involved in the plot could have known about that subtle error.\n\nThe clue turned the investigation inward. Suspicion soon fell on Meher, who had been replaced as principal by Mr Sahu’s mother. While initially dismissed as routine academic rivalry, it now appeared to be the motive behind a meticulously planned murder.\n\nPolice say Meher used the Deepavali festival as cover to hoard firecrackers and extract gunpowder. He built the bomb himself and mailed it under a false identity using a courier that had no CCTV or parcel scanning.\n\nTo build an alibi, he left his mobile phone at home and made sure to mark his attendance at college before slipping away to Raipur by train – without buying a ticket to avoid surveillance.\n\nEven more chilling, Meher had attended both the wedding and funeral of the victims.\n\nIn court, Meher claimed he was coerced into delivering the package. But under mounting evidence – including handwriting matches with the anonymous letter – he was ultimately convicted.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Mr Sahu’s father Rabindra Sahu expressed mixed emotions. “We were hoping for capital punishment, but we respect the court’s verdict and are grateful that justice has been served,” he said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/092602670cd9f7a760d48ec724f729dddaad61cab05846882a1cc755af6546dc?w=825", "alt_text": "Software engineer Soumya Sekhar Sahu, who died in the blast, and his wife Reema, who survived."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nA high-level Indian parliamentary delegation concluded a pivotal leg of its diplomatic outreach in Singapore on Tuesday, calling for united global action against terrorism and making a strong case for India’s measured but resolute response to Pakistan-backed terror attacks.\n\nLed by Janata Dal (United) MP Sanjay Kumar Jha, the multi-party delegation – comprising lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, Trinamool Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Congress and former diplomats – met Singaporean ministers, officials, lawmakers, business leaders, academics and the Indian diaspora during a packed visit.\n\nTheir central message: India will not tolerate terrorism, regardless of its origins or justifications, and seeks global solidarity in confronting this common threat.\n\nThe delegation presented a rare show of bipartisan unity, representing political rivals united in a shared mission. “This is not about party lines. When national security is under threat, India speaks in one voice,” said Mr Jha during a press briefing.\n\nTheir visit followed Operation Sindoor, India’s targeted military response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which left 26 dead, mostly tourists.\n\nIndia holds Pakistan responsible for the attack and launched precision strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 7. More than 100 militants affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly “neutralised”.\n\nThe delegation’s meetings in Singapore included sessions with Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs Sim Ann, Minister for Law Edwin Tong and MPs Vikram Nair and Saktiandi Supaat. They also engaged with the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Institute of South Asian Studies.\n\nMs Ann affirmed Singapore’s unwavering stance against terrorism, according to a High Commission of India press release. She noted in a Facebook post: “The delegation briefed me on the terror attacks in Pahalgam on April 22 and the current tensions between India and Pakistan. I shared with our visitors that Singapore maintains a strong stance against terrorism and condemns the heinous attack in Pahalgam.”\n\nSingaporean interlocutors were briefed on India’s “new normal” in its counter-terrorism policy – marked by precision, restraint and zero tolerance. Mr Jha underlined: “India will respond decisively to any terror attack. We will not tolerate nuclear blackmail. There is no distinction between terrorists and their sponsors.”\n\nIn a candid media interaction, delegation members addressed key questions around India’s motives and strategy. Former ambassador to France and Bahrain Mohan Kumar emphasised that India’s action was not escalatory but a calibrated and proportionate response aimed at dismantling terror infrastructure – not waging war.\n\nHe dismissed concerns about nuclear escalation. “Not for a minute did we think this conflict would go nuclear,” he said, reaffirming India’s long-standing no-first-use nuclear policy.\n\nWhen asked why India refrained from a broader assault, Mr Kumar replied: “We are not a war-mongering state. We acted from a position of strength, not fear. Our goal is security and economic progress – not endless conflict.”\n\nThe delegation urged Singapore and other friendly nations to extend support beyond condemnation – especially at multilateral forums such as the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nThey stressed the importance of disrupting terror financing and called for reform in global financial institutions to curb support to state sponsors of terror.\n\nThey also pushed back against Pakistan’s attempts to internationalise the Kashmir issue. “This is about terrorism, not territory,” former foreign minister Salman Khurshid said. “India’s response is aimed at protecting lives and restoring peace – not pursuing escalation.”\n\nTrinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee posted on X: “Terrorism respects no borders, and the fight against it must unite us all. India stands firm: Those who perpetrate, support or justify terrorism will be held to account.”\n\nDespite the tensions, the delegation said they encountered no investor concerns in any of the countries visited. “Japan, Korea and Singapore – all reassured us they view India as a top investment destination,” said Mr Kumar, adding that “India’s commitment to economic reforms remains firm”.\n\nThe Singapore leg was part of a five-nation tour covering Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, as part of India’s effort to shape global perceptions and rally support after the Pahalgam terror strike.\n\n“This visit is just the beginning,” Mr Jha said. “The world must come together against terrorism – and India will lead by example.”\n\nIn all, seven multi-party delegations from India have been tasked by the government to visit 33 global capitals and emphasise Pakistan’s links to terrorism.\n\n“We are not a war-mongering state. We acted from a position of strength, not fear. Our goal is security and economic progress – not endless conflict.”\n\nIndia’s former ambassador to France and Bahrain Mohan Kumar", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b6c3e433ccf86bdc1e4f077f5728a386a0c3955f629718f2f4d2aeb379ae3a4a?w=825", "alt_text": "The Indian all-party parliamentary delegation calling on Law Minister Edwin Tong (fourth from left)."}]}

Kavi\n\nReema Dudekula\n\nOn a humid May evening at Blu Jaz in Clarke Quay, the room fell into a hush as Pragathi Guruprasad took the stage. The voice was unmistakable – honeyed, precise, expansive – but it was not solely her vocals that elicited the loudest cheers, it was the authorship.\n\nAfter years of contributing vocals to South Indian cinema, Pragathi has begun to carve out a space as a songwriter and producer in her own right. Her latest work, including the single Adada, signals a new chapter in her career.\n\nBorn at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in 1997, the 27-year-old musician traces her artistic lineage to this very island. Her family lived in Bukit Batok for nearly a decade before emigrating to California when she was just two. But even in her absence, the rhythms of Singapore, its blend of tradition and modernity, have still threaded through her artistic identity.\n\nLong before any stage lights or studio booths, her musical journey quietly began when her father, Guruprasad, a software engineer by profession and Carnatic music enthusiast by calling, taught local children in their home – not for profit, but out of devotion.\n\n“That is where it all started actually,” she reflected. “My love for singing was born here.” Young Pragathi would linger in the corner of those informal classes, absorbing the raga structures, rhythmic cycles, and devotional textures that would later form the scaffolding of her craft.\n\nHer formal training would come to include both Carnatic and Hindustani classical music – two disciplines that demand not only vocal agility but unwavering dedication.\n\nThat dual education, rigorous and often ascetic, would prove foundational later on in her career, as it instilled in her a discipline she now considers central to her approach as a songwriter, performer, and producer. “It’s the blueprint,” she said.\n\nAnd yet, like many careers that begin early and in the public eye, her ascent was not entirely intentional.\n\nIn 2011, at just 14, she entered Super Singer Junior, a Tamil television competition, at the urging of her mother, Kanaka. “She wanted to see if other people thought I could sing as well as she thought I could. It (Super Singer) went on to completely change my life,” Pragathi said.\n\nWhat followed was a meteoric rise. Pragathi emerged as a finalist and ultimately the first runner-up, winning not just a title, but the admiration of millions. Almost overnight, she became a fixture in the Tamil playback scene. “It became difficult for me to get out of my house without being swarmed, it was a huge shock for a kid. But my parents kept me grounded.”\n\nHer voice, mature beyond her years, soon found its way into the studio. Among her early recordings, one in particular stands out: Osaka Osaka, composed by Anirudh Ravichander for Vanakkam Chennai. “Anirudh is actually a close friend of my brother’s,” she said, laughing.\n\n“Recording that track didn’t feel like work at all – it felt like a bunch of kids playing around in the studio.” The track’s breezy joy and vocal ease reflect the spontaneity of that experience, and it remains one of her most beloved contributions to South Indian cinema.\n\nOther tracks followed, including the aching Paravai Parandhuchu from Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum, and the haunting lullaby Laali Laali from Theeran Adhigaram Ondru.\n\nStill, while music was always the dream, her path wasn’t singular. In the years following her rise on Super Singer, she enrolled at UCLA to study law, a decision shaped by both pragmatism and her father’s stubbornness. “My dad was really adamant that I have a degree to fall back on,” she said. “He believed in my music, but he also knew how unpredictable the industry could be.” She ultimately completed her undergraduate degree programme but chose not to become a lawyer.\n\nHowever, even as her discography expanded and accolades accumulated, Pragathi found herself approaching a creative precipice. “I was lost,” she admitted. “I wasn’t happy with the work I was doing, and I didn’t know who I was as an artist anymore. I was putting so much pressure on myself. I kept thinking, If I can’t compose like A.R. Rahman, then what’s the point? I had this self-imposed stress.”\n\nIt was during this time that a longtime friend and producer, Shravan Sridhar, intervened. “He basically told me to snap out of it. To stop sitting in my own fog and start creating again,” she recalled. What began as a small collaboration turned into something transformative.\n\nThe result of that renewed clarity was Adada, a single released earlier this year that reimagines the language of love from a female perspective. For the first time, Pragathi wasn’t just performing music – she was writing and owning it.\n\nAnd she isn’t slowing down. In an exclusive update to Tabla!, Pragathi revealed she’s currently working on her debut album, with her next single slated for release in the coming months. As for dream collaborations? One name stands out: Dhibu Ninan Thomas. “He is definitely at the top of my list, one of my favourites.”\n\nFor Pragathi, the story is far from over. In a world that often demands speed and spectacle, Pragathi’s path is a reminder that the most meaningful art still takes time. And perhaps more importantly, that it often begins, quietly, with a child listening to her father sing.\n\n“My mother wanted to see if other people thought I could sing as well as she thought I could, it (Super Singer) went on to completely change my life.”\n\nPragathi Guruprasad", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/52edf91ba921dd60d1a7685fb6cea28a41f69dd329ec6d631c6c8253f7fadf2c?w=825", "alt_text": "Pragathi Guruprasad performing at Blu Jaz."}]}

With his thick moustache and three-day stubble he looked approximately my age. The prospect of a friend next door perked me up. Then he spoke.\n\n“Hello uncle; hello aunty,” he said.  “Hello,” I said coldly and offered him my hand. “I’m Paddy. And you?”\n\nI thought he’d recognise his error and address me by my name.\n\n“I’m Ajit, uncle,” he said. “I just finished my B. Com and am looking for a job.”\n\nPerhaps my hint had been too subtle.\n\n“I just started my first job after college,” I said.  “Just like you,” I added to drive the point home.  “That’s great, uncle,” he said.\n\nOver time, we often met in the corridor, and he never let go of the nephew’s deference for the wise, aged uncle.\n\nA few years later, my wife and I met another young man in another apartment corridor in another city. At six feet five inches, he towered over us and in the dim light looked dangerous.\n\nI remember thinking that if I had met him in a dark, lonely alley, I’d have handed him my wallet and watch without waiting to be asked. As he greeted us, it became obvious that he had met my wife previously.\n\n“Hello Akka (elder sister),” he said, “nice to see you again.” I smiled: the man knew how to impart respect without making the recipient feel aged. He looked pleasant and gentle; I rebuked myself for thinking he looked dangerous.\n\n“And this must be your husband?” the fine fellow continued. “Hello uncle! So nice to meet you at last.”\n\n“Nasty specimen,” I said to my wife when we entered our flat. “Doesn’t he look like a Bollywood villain?” “Of course not!” she said. “He looks sweet and innocent.”\n\nA shiver ran down my spine. Would I leave my wife behind in this process of ageing, collecting “uncles” at every corner while she remained a demure “Akka’”?\n\nAs long as we shared the rewards of seniority equally and laughed together at the foibles of youth, the situation was bearable. But if “Akka” were to find every lout who called me “uncle” endearing and lovable, I’d be left to laugh alone.\n\nIt was a chilling prospect. I don’t laugh well alone.\n\nBut soon she became “aunty’’ again, and equanimity was restored.\n\nWhen we came to Singapore, where deference to elders is a deeply ingrained social norm, we were gratified that Singaporeans mostly use the terms “uncle” and “aunty” when addressing elderly service providers, such as taxi drivers and restaurant staff. We were spared… by the locals.\n\nBut not by a few NRIs still steeped in the uncle and aunty syndrome.\n\nOnce, as we exited the lift at our building, a couple was struggling to enter it with a load of shopping bags. Both were in their late forties, the man was balding, and among the few hairs left on his head, the colour grey dominated. My wife and I helped them carry the bags into the lift.\n\n“Thank you so much,” the man said. “It’s so kind of you, uncle.”\n\n“I have more hair on my head than you,” I wanted to say, but the lift had left.\n\nTwo days after this I was talking to my 26-year-old son in Mumbai.\n\n“You won’t believe this, Appa (dad),” he said. “In the lift today, I met a man in his thirties taking his six-year-old son to school. The boy called me ‘uncle’! I felt very old.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” I told him. “Once you marry, college graduates will also call you ‘uncle’!”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/61689f44a502ae616f1b52670e401f950d3d0b25d83ee5942740a17eb7e3f92b?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

According to Singapore’s National Population Health Survey 2022, one in six residents has experienced mental health issues, while one in three youths reported severe symptoms of anxiety or depression.\n\nDesigned to integrate seamlessly into daily life, the Miracle of Mind app provides a structured seven-minute meditation rooted in yogic science and modern research.\n\nUsers receive personalised insights, progress tracking and motivational prompts. The app has already seen over a million downloads within 15 hours of its global release, quickly ranking among the top wellness apps worldwide.\n\n“This is a beautiful blend of mindfulness and mental clarity,” said CEO of Simitri Group International David C.

No Indian driver had ever stood on the top step of the F2 podium before.\n\nTo do so at the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix, a circuit that tests the mettle of even the best in the world, amplifies the magnitude of the achievement.\n\nBorn on Sept 22, 2000, in Bengaluru, Kush grew up in a family steeped in motorsport. His elder brother, Arjun Maini, is a former Formula 2 driver and a constant source of inspiration.\n\nFrom early karting stints at local circuits to globe-trotting campaigns in junior series, Kush’s journey has been a tale of relentless perseverance.\n\nHe began his international racing career in 2016 in the Italian F4 Championship and went on to compete in the Formula Renault Eurocup, BRDC British Formula 3, and FIA Formula 3. Each step brought with it valuable experience, if not always podiums.\n\nIn 2021, he even dabbled in endurance racing, competing in the FIA World Endurance Championship, a move that further refined his adaptability and racecraft.\n\nBut the real leap came in 2023 when Maini graduated to FIA Formula 2, widely considered the last proving ground before Formula 1.\n\nStarting with Campos Racing, he moved to Invicta Racing where he earned his first podium. Then came the switch to DAMS Lucas Oil, setting the stage for the breakthrough moment in Monaco.\n\nQualifying 10th for the Feature Race meant Maini started on pole for the Sprint Race, thanks to the reverse-grid rule. But Monaco is no charity – it demands perfection.\n\nWith barely any room for error and overtaking next to impossible, the pressure was on from the moment the lights went out.\n\nMaini rose to the occasion. For 30 nerve-racking laps around Monte Carlo’s iconic narrow streets, he delivered a near-flawless performance, fending off pressure from rivals and maintaining control with clinical composure, reported formulaone.com.\n\nThe result? A historic win that had him singing the Indian national anthem on the podium, tears in his eyes and pride in his voice.\n\n“P1 and first Indian to win at Monaco. It’s a great honour and a dream come true, really. We kept believing,” Maini said post-race, crediting his DAMS Lucas Oil team for their unwavering support through the ups and downs.\n\nIndia has produced talented drivers before – Narain Karthikeyan, Karun Chandhok and even Maini’s brother Arjun – but sustained success at the international level has remained elusive.\n\nMaini’s win, especially at Monaco, is not just a feel-good story; it’s a statement of intent. It signals that Indian drivers can not only compete but also win on the biggest stages.\n\nBacking from motorsport stalwarts such as Gautam Singhania’s JK Racing and TVS Racing has played a crucial role in his journey. Singhania was present in Monaco and celebrated alongside Maini in the pit lane, his pride evident.\n\n“This is not just Kush’s win. It’s a win for Indian motorsport. We’ve supported him for years, and this is the moment we’ve all been working towards,” Singhania said.\n\nMaini’s Monaco win has put him firmly in the spotlight and reignited talk of a potential full-time Formula 1 seat in the near future. Currently serving as a reserve driver for the BWT Alpine F1 Team, he now has both the credibility and the momentum to make a serious case.\n\nHis win at Monaco marks his first with DAMS and his second in a Sprint Race format. It moved him up to 13th in the F2 standings, 54 points adrift of current leader Alexander Dunne.\n\nThe focus now shifts to Barcelona next weekend, where Maini will look to convert this momentum into a sustained championship push.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/626b42dc5ef957a495c3b9fa4f34ca8be5f81276bed7ae72a561b913c3f35552?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Kavi\n\nSakti Singaravelu\n\nAmerican pop star Lady Gaga, best known for her breakout hits Just Dance and Bad Romance, is in Singapore to perform four shows to promote her latest studio album, Mayhem.\n\nAnd it was quite the mayhem when tabla! interviewed some of her fans, endearingly called Little Monsters, at the National Stadium on May 19.\n\nThey turned up in droves wearing eye-catching and gender-bending costumes in honour of Mother Monster, who last performed in Singapore in 2012 as part of her Born This Way Ball world tour.\n\n“She taught me how to love myself for who I am, especially during a time when everyone was telling me to change myself,” said Mr Sharan Prasad, 19, a national serviceman.\n\n“She also taught me that I don’t have to change myself to fit in with societal norms or to please people so I love what she stands for.”\n\nWhen asked what his parents thought of Lady Gaga, 39, he replied: “My mum’s quite open. I think my dad’s okay with it.\n\n“I haven’t talked much about Gaga with them but they’re aware that I’m here, but not aware about this though”, he added, as he cheekily pointed to his goth-inspired outfit.\n\nHe wore a head to toe black ensemble look complete with maleficent-inspired devil horns, silver chain with a skeleton pendant, knee-length skirt, a top with feathered wings and six-inch high platform boots – all nods to Lady Gaga’s album Mayhem, which features a more gothic aesthetic.\n\nMr Sharan Prasad in his goth-inspired outfit.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nMr Sharan is attending all four concerts, the last of which is on May 24. The total cost for the tickets and all the different outfits he’s put together for each show amounts to a whopping $3,344.\n\n“I paid for it using my savings from national service and my parents also chipped in,” he said.\n\nAnother fan who came decked up was Ms A Priyadarshini, 24, who recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University. She wore a short, metallic pleated dress, Air Jordan sneakers and brown-tinted shades to imitate the Moon Man trophy Lady Gaga received when she won Video of the Year at MTV’s Video Music Awards (VMAs) in 2010.\n\nHer friend, Ms Belinda Leong, 23, took it up a notch by recreating the iconic “meat dress” Lady Gaga wore to the VMAs that same year. Thankfully, Ms Belinda did not sew together strips of raw beef but instead crocheted her dress out of pink and white yarn.\n\nLittle Monsters: Ms A Priyadarshini & Ms Belinda Leong\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\n“Everything is handmade. Even the shoes I crocheted and based it on how she did it,” Ms Leong said.\n\nThe young fan took one and a half months while working full-time as a Quality Control Technician to crochet her entire concert look, which included a beanie, two bracelets and a tote-style handbag. “I started sewing it the moment we got the tickets in March,” she said.\n\nFans from other countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia flocked to Singapore to catch Lady Gaga in concert as it’s the only Asian country she will be performing in during the Mayhem Ball world tour, which officially kicks off in July.\n\nAccountant Surendraj Manivanan, 32, travelled from Johor Bahru to attend the concert. “Due to the stricter rules in Malaysia, I don’t think she can perform there,” he explained.\n\nHe’s been listening to Lady Gaga’s pop anthems for the past 16 years, starting with Poker Face in 2008. His favourite albums are The Fame Monster (2009) and Born This Way (2011), and he was especially excited to see live performances of his favourite tracks, Judas and Scheiße.\n\nMr Surendraj Manivanan travelled from Johor Bahru to catch Lady Gaga in concert.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nHe wore a more casual yet stylish outfit of black cargo pants, New Balance sneakers and a graphic tee with Lady Gaga’s face printed on it. To complete the look, he wore face makeup that paid tribute to Lady Gaga’s signature winged black eyeliner and bold red lips.\n\nMs Nishalani Raju, 30, a finance associate from Kuala Lumpur, flew in with two of her friends to attend the concert. “I have been following her since I was in high school. I still cannot believe that I’m going to see her live today. It’s a dream come true,” she said.\n\nWhen asked if Lady Gaga has a sizable Indian fan base, she said: “Of course! Back in Malaysia, we have a bunch of fan clubs so she definitely has fans who are Indian.”\n\nFor tabla! readers, Ms Nishalani recommends the dance-pop track, Paparazzi.\n\n“Indian fans will appreciate the song because its lyrics encourage you to be wild and the beat is very similar to the Bollywood songs from the 2010s,” she explained.\n\nThe trio came dressed to the nines with their sequinned tops, layered fringe pants, bejewelled sneakers, studded chokers and customised costume accessories like a metal-brace mouthpiece in reference to Lady Gaga onstage costumes, which include armoured bodysuits, feathered wings and flowing trains.\n\nLittle Monsters: Ms Nishalani Raju & her friends.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nSome 47,000 fans attended the opening show on May 18, and online reviews have praised the pop star’s commanding stage presence, high-energy backup dancers, elaborate sets and powerful live vocals – all proof that a Lady Gaga concert is anything but ordinary.\n\nLike her, Lady Gaga’s fandom is headstrong and unapologetic. Many have followed her since her debut in 2008, yet the community is always open to anyone who’s ever been told they’re “weird” or as Gaga would say, born this way.\n\nMr Sharan Prasad taking a selfie with his friend at National Stadium.\n\nPhoto: T.

In one WhatsApp exchange allegedly recovered by authorities, Jyoti reportedly asked Danish to “get me married in Pakistan,” hinting at emotional entanglement with her handler.\n\nThe police claim she also communicated regularly with another ISI officer, Ali Hasan, and that her chats included coded references to Indian Army movement and other sensitive locations.\n\n“Her romantic overtures may have been sincere, or they may have been tactics of manipulation. But what’s clear is she knew who she was dealing with,” said an intelligence officer involved in the probe, according to NDTV.\n\nOne of the more baffling questions in the case is how Jyoti funded her lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle.\n\nDespite having no known source of income beyond modest influencer revenue, her travels included destinations like China, the UAE, Indonesia, and multiple trips to Pakistan.\n\nPolice are now investigating four bank accounts linked to her, including one that showed suspicious transactions routed from Dubai – well beyond what her online earnings could explain.\n\n“There’s no financial trail that justifies her travel and accommodations,” said SP Sawan. “We suspect covert funding was involved.”\n\nShe reportedly used encrypted platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp and Snapchat to communicate with handlers and often adopted pseudonyms like “Jatt Randhawa” to mask her identity.\n\nShe is also said to have travelled to Bali with Danish, further cementing her closeness with the Pakistani operative.\n\nPolice maintain that, while there is no evidence tying Jyoti to terrorist organisations or plots, she knowingly remained in touch with foreign intelligence agents.\n\n“She may not have had direct access to military intelligence, but even basic logistical details shared at the wrong time can compromise security,” an official said.\n\nThe National Investigation Agency and Intelligence Bureau have questioned her, and digital forensics teams are now combing through her devices and social media history for evidence of covert operations, reported NDTV.\n\nJyoti’s arrest is part of a larger intelligence sweep. At least 12 individuals have been picked up across Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh over the past two weeks for suspected espionage activities.

According to Superintendent of Police Rohit Rajbir Singh, the candidates were equipped with GSM-enabled electronic devices concealed in undergarments, and micro earpieces inserted deep inside their ears – invisible to the naked eye.\n\n“Once the exam began, the candidates would quietly communicate the question paper set code to external handlers,” said SP Singh. “Using brief pauses or coughs as signals, answers were dictated back in real time via the hidden earpieces.”\n\nThis real-time relay system allowed the candidates to cheat undetected – until one alert invigilator at Kingcup Public School noticed suspicious behaviour during the evening lab attendant exam, reported the Press Trust of India.\n\nA student was found fidgeting repeatedly with his clothing and was discovered with a concealed device. Police were called in immediately, and 23 students were apprehended on the spot. Another was caught at Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya.\n\nSubsequent raids on hotels and lodges where the examinees were staying led to the arrest of 29 more suspects, bringing the total to 53.\n\nThe criminal syndicate behind the operation is believed to be based in Jind, Haryana – more than 2,600km from the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. Investigators say this network specialises in helping candidates pass competitive exams in exchange for hefty payments, using high-tech cheating devices.\n\nCandidates were allegedly instructed to select remote exam centres like Itanagar, Dimapur (Nagaland) and Gangtok (Sikkim) to reduce the chances of getting caught. Once admit cards were released, they were given the devices and trained in their use.\n\n“This was no ordinary cheating. It was a professionally coordinated racket,” SP Singh said. “The candidates themselves admitted to being coached on how to use the devices discreetly. The aim was to exploit vulnerabilities in low-surveillance regions.”\n\nPolice seized 29 GSM-enabled devices, micro earpieces, batteries and SIM cards during the crackdown. Several of the arrested individuals have already confessed to their roles in the operation, reported NDTV.\n\nAll 53 suspects have been booked under multiple laws, including the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act and the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024.\n\nFirst information reports have been registered at the Niti Vihar and Chimpu police stations.\n\nOfficials have launched a wider probe into the syndicate’s activities, suspecting links to similar cheating attempts reported in Chandigarh, Shimla, Dehradun and Gangtok.\n\n“The scale of this racket could be national,” said an investigating officer. “This isn’t just about one exam; this is about systematically undermining the integrity of public recruitment.”\n\nThe CBSE and NVS authorities have been formally notified, and special teams have been dispatched to Haryana to identify and arrest the handlers and middlemen.\n\n“This is a serious breach, and it’s shocking that so many were involved,” said an NVS official who wished to remain anonymous. “We will work closely with law enforcement to ensure the culprits behind this network are punished, and safeguards are tightened.”\n\n“This was no ordinary cheating.

Rahman’s Vellai Pookal and the Bollywood hit Tu Jaane Naa.\n\nA standout moment was the band’s unique rendition of Hedwig’s Theme, the iconic Harry Potter tune composed by the legendary John Williams, renowned for some of Hollywood’s most memorable film scores like Jaws (1975) and Jurassic Park (1993).\n\nSet in the Kaapi raga, which induces feelings of pathos and sadness, Hedwig’s Theme was seamlessly intertwined with the devotional song Kurai Ondrum Illai, Alwarpettai Aandava from the 2004 film Vasool Raja MBBS starring Kamal Hasan and A.R. Rahman’s Mazhai Thuli from the 1999 Tamil Nadu State Award-winning film Sangamam.\n\nThe rehearsal showcased the band’s versatility in performing an array of multilingual songs while effortlessly blurring the lines between musical genres.\n\n“We wanted to make it simple for people and let them enjoy ragas through the songs they already know,” Kaushik said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e3131f90d80a500a27e211c27792d6b692d4c85c141bce6490a38097fad67b46?w=825", "alt_text": "The Re-inKarnation band members, collaborators and managers at Tonehouse Studios."}]}

It even outpaces the previous CFO record – US$86 million awarded to Nikola’s CFO Kim Brady in 2020 – by a wide margin.\n\nThe compensation was calculated based on the value of Tesla’s stock at the time of the grant, with Tesla affirming in its filings that the award was designed to reflect “individual performance and retention” in light of the company’s long-term equity strategy.\n\nMr Taneja’s story is one of quiet determination and sharp financial acumen. Born and educated in India, he graduated from Delhi University with a bachelor of commerce degree in 1999.\n\nHe earned his chartered accountant credentials in 2000 from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and later became a certified public accountant in the US in 2006.\n\nHe began his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he spent nearly 17 years in India and the US, eventually rising to senior manager in Assurance.\n\nBut it was his move in 2016 to SolarCity – a solar energy company that was later absorbed by Tesla – that put him on a path to the top of the electric vehicle titan.\n\nAfter Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2017, Mr Taneja joined as assistant corporate controller. His trajectory was steep and fast: corporate controller in 2018, chief accounting officer in 2019, and finally CFO in 2023.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s SEC filings, the lion’s share of the US$139.5 million came in the form of stock awards – part of a larger incentive plan designed to reward executives who help drive Tesla’s market value, profitability and operational efficiency.\n\nThe move is in line with Tesla’s high-stakes compensation philosophy, which famously includes CEO Elon Musk’s own US$56 billion performance-based pay plan (currently under legal scrutiny).\n\nTesla rewards its executives based on aggressive growth metrics, and 2024 was a year when the company made strategic expansions into emerging markets, strengthened its energy storage business and continued innovating in AI and autonomous driving.\n\nMr Taneja’s pay is not just about current performance but also a bet on the future. His compensation plan aligns long-term interests with shareholders and expects him to deliver transformative value across Tesla’s diverse portfolio, which now includes automotive, energy solutions, AI and robotics.\n\nAs CFO, Mr Taneja has been instrumental in navigating Tesla through volatile market conditions, inflationary headwinds and supply chain disruptions – all while ensuring that the company continues to post healthy margins and reinvest into innovation.\n\nUnder his watch, Tesla expanded operations in countries like India and Indonesia, while also announcing plans for next-gen battery production.\n\nHe has played a pivotal role in streamlining Tesla’s balance sheet, ensuring capital efficiency and optimising cash flow – critical tasks as the company faces rising competition from Chinese electric vehicle makers and traditional auto giants going electric.\n\nMr Taneja also oversaw Tesla’s move into more sustainable financial strategies, including a renewed focus on green financing and expanding the company’s carbon credit revenue streams.\n\nHis success has become a source of pride for the Indian diaspora. His appointment as CFO last year was already seen as a significant milestone, but this new achievement – being the world’s top-paid CFO – resonates deeply in a global environment where diversity in executive leadership is still evolving.\n\nHis rise underscores the growing influence of Indian-origin executives in Silicon Valley and beyond. With leaders like Mr Pichai (Google), Mr Nadella (Microsoft) and Mr Arvind Krishna (IBM), Mr Taneja now joins a list of high-impact Indian-American professionals redefining the boundaries of business and innovation.\n\nMr Taneja is known for eschewing the limelight, preferring instead to focus on strategic execution and operational efficiency. Unlike more flamboyant figures in Silicon Valley, he is described as methodical, measured and deeply committed to his role.\n\nColleagues describe him as someone with a rare blend of accounting precision and strategic foresight – a combination Tesla sorely needs amid rising global competition in the electric vehicle market.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b06e9a71df7210777fd4a86c607ec8930c5d01a8933b948a0c232b24aa16ef1a?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2e0f187318dba445e3c3942347185c619e05993a6af2cf6b13334391c6b1fb89?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/12e2bfe84886b8167cf9896f15d9224007e06255a1603ba5aab7943e2ea8ca09?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b06e9a71df7210777fd4a86c607ec8930c5d01a8933b948a0c232b24aa16ef1a?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2e0f187318dba445e3c3942347185c619e05993a6af2cf6b13334391c6b1fb89?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/12e2bfe84886b8167cf9896f15d9224007e06255a1603ba5aab7943e2ea8ca09?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/b06e9a71df7210777fd4a86c607ec8930c5d01a8933b948a0c232b24aa16ef1a?w=825", "alt_text": "Vaibhav Taneja, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai."}]}

In the tapestry of human experience, every thread holds the weight of the whole.”\n\nMs Bhasthi, the first Indian translator to win the prize, said: “I hope this award leads to more translations from Kannada and other South Asian languages. Our stories need to be heard, across borders and cultures.”\n\nThe recognition comes at a time when regional Indian literature is gaining global acclaim. It follows Geetanjali Shree’s Tomb of Sand, which won the International Booker in 2022, translated from Hindi.\n\nMadam Banu’s personal journey mirrors the struggles in her fiction. Raised in a conservative Muslim neighbourhood in Karnataka, she was educated in both Urdu and Kannada – eventually choosing Kannada as her literary voice.\n\nShe married for love at 26 but faced domestic restrictions, including being forced into wearing a burqa and abandoning her writing dreams.\n\nAt one point, overwhelmed by post-partum depression and despair, she nearly set herself on fire. “That moment changed everything,” she later said. “I picked up my pen again, because I had to survive.”\n\nSince then, Madam Banu has published six short story collections, a novel, essays and poetry. Her work has earned major accolades including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award.\n\nBut Heart Lamp – with its focus on lives lived at the margins – has now brought her global recognition.\n\nThe win is being seen as both literary and political.\n\n“In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often reduced to symbols,” said one reviewer. “Mushtaq refuses that. Her women endure – not for headlines, but for dignity.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4c74baa7d2b42f570a1ee8b8d6689aa8c3bd0ea00fd14d38c605b6be7963bc16?w=825", "alt_text": "Madam Banu Mushtaq."}]}

Shanmugam as Coordinating Minister for National Security, as well as Mr Chan as Coordinating Minister for Public Services and Mr Ong as Coordinating Minister for Social Policies, who will boost what PM Wong described as his “core team”, which also includes Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong.\n\nWhile it was widely expected that he would appoint a second deputy prime minister as has been the case for many of the previous terms of government, PM Wong did not do so.\n\nProfessor Terence Ho, an adjunct associate professor in practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said this can be seen as “an innovation to create a broader senior leadership team”.\n\nInstitute of Policy Studies (IPS) Social Lab research fellow Teo Kay Key, describing it as a “break from typical expectations”, said that with policies being more multifaceted now, having coordinating ministers can help to prevent overlaps or contradictions.\n\n“In this sense, they might be more helpful to the overall operation of the Government compared to one more DPM, who would be playing more of a role to assist the PM in determining the overall direction of the country or overarching national policies,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, IPS senior research fellow Gillian Koh said the coordinating minister appointments will help to nurture the younger leaders and provide them the “pressure” to think holistically.\n\nSharing her sentiment was independent political observer Felix Tan, who saw it as a test for Mr Chan and Mr Ong, who are covering critical areas.\n\nMr Chan is also taking on another new role as Defence Minister and relinquishing his Education Ministry portfolio, while Mr Ong will retain his Health Ministry portfolio.\n\nPM Wong does not appear to be in a hurry to appoint a peer as his deputy, said Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan.\n\n“The two 4G coordinating ministers may well be the front runners to be made DPM perhaps in a mid-term reshuffle,” he said.\n\nAnalysts also said PM Wong’s Cabinet choices signal his priorities in both continuity and renewal, with the ruling PAP’s 4G leadership now clearly in the driver’s seat.\n\nNoting that only a handful of the 3G leaders remained to lend their experience and expertise, Prof Ho said the retirement of several party stalwarts in the recent election signals confidence that the team of younger leaders “is ready to steer the country forward”.\n\nThe Straits Times", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4931758f786a9228e81206a0ec74db1cee3971a7fb32aeb8f4fa9f0f4064a7e3?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Kavi\n\nSakti Singaravelu\n\nMr Shaun Ho happily runs Happy Briyani in Holland Village, never mind if biryani is wrongly spelt on his signboard.\n\n“My business partner called it Happy Briyani because I’m always smiling,” Mr Ho said.\n\nAs for the misspelling of biryani on the signboard? “It was a typo,” he admitted shyly. “But it was already printed, so we kept it.”\n\nTucked away in Holland Village Market & Food Centre, Mr Ho’s hawker stall stands out – it sells chicken biryani on one side and oriental-style dough fritters on the other.\n\nHappy Briyani hawker stall at Holland Village Market & Food Centre\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nThough Singapore is known for its culinary diversity, it’s rare to find a hawker stall that offers such an unexpected combination, but the choice to do so was a practical one.\n\n“We needed only half the stall to prepare the biryani, so we thought why not use the rest of the space to sell something else?” Mr Ho, 33, explained.\n\nThe original plan was to sell Indian rojak and snacks like onion bhaji and samosas but, without a supplier, he and his business partner had to pivot.\n\nSo they settled on chicken biryani – which Mr Ho learnt to make from watching YouTube videos – and dough fritters sourced from local supplier Deli Snacks.\n\nThe fritters was a smart move given their popularity as a breakfast staple among the older Singaporean Chinese, but why chicken biryani?\n\nSaid Mr Ho: “It was all my business partner’s idea. A month before we opened, he surprised me by telling me that he had placed a bid for an Indian food stall.”\n\nCertain stalls in each hawker centre are designated for Indian cuisine and are usually located within the halal food area.\n\nThe National Environment Agency provides a list of Indian dishes that can be sold in such stalls.\n\nSaid Mr Ho: “The examples were vadai, roti prata, thosai, nasi biryani, putu mayam and tandoori chicken. Out of these, I chose biryani.”\n\nWhile the fritters attract the morning crowd, the giant pot of simmering chicken curry on the biryani side of the stall, catches their attention.\n\nHappy Briyani’s chicken curry simmering in the giant pot.\n\nPhoto: Sakti Singaravelu\n\nA win-win situation.\n\nLocated a short walk from Holland Village MRT station, Happy Briyani opened on March 4 this year.\n\nMr Ho, who had never cooked Indian food before, developed his chicken biryani recipe simply by watching many YouTube videos.\n\n“I anyhow whack one,” he said – a Singaporean way of saying he winged it.\n\nStill, he’s no amateur. With years of hawker experience and an International Diploma in Culinary Arts from SHATEC in Bukit Batok, Mr Ho certainly knows his way around a kitchen.\n\nAs a teen, he worked at a western food stall, followed by a stint at the locally well-known Jin Jin dessert stall in ABC Brickworks Market & Food Centre in Bukit Merah.\n\nAfter SHATEC, he worked in sales and as a Grab driver before returning to the hawker industry, starting his own stall at Toa Payoh Industrial Park selling satay and chicken wings during the Covid pandemic.\n\nHis passion for cooking was born out of necessity. After his parents divorced when he was one, he moved in with his father.\n\n“He didn’t know how to cook, so in order to survive I learnt how to cook for the both of us,” he said.\n\nHe experimented with cooking Chinese dishes like roast pork and Singaporean western food classics like chicken chop, fish and chips, all based on YouTube tutorials.\n\n“Everything I learned is from YouTube,” Mr Ho said.\n\nFor just $5 a plate, Mr Ho offers a generous portion of fragrant basmati rice and a large chicken leg served with a boiled egg and achar (Peranakan-style pickled vegetables). To top it off, a hefty ladle of curry is poured over the chicken and rice.\n\nHappy Briyani’s $5 chicken biryani\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nA fusion of Indian and Chinese flavours, the chicken curry features a coconut cream base that gives it a rich creamy texture that coats each grain of biryani rice. Yet the spices like garam masala, cardamom and chilli aren’t toned down, delivering a satisfying kick with each mouthful.\n\nThe price is a steal, especially in swanky Holland Village where other biryanis can easily cost $20 a plate.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Happy Briyani is able to sell around 60 plates a day.\n\nMost of the stall’s customers are Chinese and tend to be retail workers from the many high-end restaurants and shops that surround the food centre.\n\nHowever, Mr Ho hopes to attract more Indian customers.\n\nA Malaysian Indian customer once told him that his biryani was “power” and reminded him of the chicken biryani back home.\n\nNeedless to say, it made Mr Ho...happy.\n\nMr Shaun Ho serving a plate of his $5 chicken biryani.\n\nPhoto: T.

In 2011, he visited the country during the promotion of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, a trip that included a red-carpet premiere in Mumbai and a visit to the Taj Mahal.\n\n“I feel so much love for India. It’s an amazing country – amazing people, amazing culture,” Cruise said, reminiscing about that visit. “From the moment I landed to going to the Taj Mahal and spending time in Mumbai… I remember each moment quite vividly.”\n\nHe described the experience as “etched” in his memory, one that left a lasting impression and built strong connections with the country and its people. “I have so many friends in India. I cannot wait to go back,” he said with a smile.\n\nThe Hindi phrases spoken by Cruise – especially his line from The Final Reckoning, “Mujh par bharosa karo, ek aakhri baar” (Trust me, one last time) – won the hearts of Indian fans across platforms.\n\nCruise’s statement comes at a time when Bollywood and Hollywood are inching closer through shared projects, crossover actors and collaborative ventures.\n\nIn recent years, Indian actors like Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor have appeared in Hollywood blockbusters. But Cruise – arguably the biggest action star in the world – declaring his interest in making a Bollywood-style film could be a game-changer.\n\nSuch a move could potentially open doors to a deeper cultural exchange between the two cinematic powerhouses and elevate Indian film traditions on a global scale. \r\rMeanwhile, Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning has already hit Indian screens – a full six days ahead of its US release on May 23.\n\nDirected by long-time collaborator Christopher McQuarrie, the eighth and final installment in the blockbuster franchise features a returning cast including Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, and more.\n\nThe film is screening across India in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu in premium formats such as IMAX and 4DX, drawing enthusiastic crowds from all regions. The early release, coupled with Cruise’s tailored outreach to Indian audiences, is being seen as a strategic and heartfelt gesture.\n\nCruise’s video message has racked up millions of views online, with Indian fans celebrating his genuine warmth and respect for their culture.\n\n“This is not a press quote. This is emotion. Cruise speaking Hindi and dreaming of Bollywood? It’s real,” said one fan on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n“He’s one of the few Hollywood actors who truly appreciates Indian cinema,” said another.\n\n“I would love to make a Bollywood-style film. It would be so much fun and amazing to do that. I love the dancing and the singing. That is such a unique experience and craftsmanship of the actors to be able to sing, dance and act all at once.”\n\nTom Cruise", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cd9589d32d05d1951228346b75e2120012101152817a00f7f59b4a7eeb5a1c87?w=825", "alt_text": "Tom Cruise (right) with Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor at the Taj Mahal on Dec 3, 2011."}]}

It was a brilliant move as pedal power is extremely reliable, requiring minimal maintenance compared to trucks and motorcycles.\n\nBicycles also did not require fuel, so during the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945, fuel shortages made bicycles indispensable to travel and moving goods.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the 1960s, nearly every family had a bicycle – usually a model from the Raleigh Bicycle Company.\n\nOn his trusty – and rusty – Raleigh, I remember my grandfather cycling from Rosyth Road, which is near Serangoon North, to Little India and back on some Sundays for his shopping. A journey that would be about 30km.\n\nOver the years, bicycles lost ground to cars and became mere playthings for children.\n\nNot any more, as increasing numbers of adults are taking up cycling these days, often in brightly-coloured skin-tight outfits.\n\nMy friend Ronald is one of these enthusiasts and often does 40km on some mornings but unburdened by several kilos of chicken or mutton, potatoes, onions and what else that goes into the grandparents’ curry dish of that Sunday.\n\nModern bikes are state-of-the art, often constructed of some lightweight alloy and featuring a multitude of gears that would leave my granddad scratching his head.\n\nA basic road model costs between $4,000 and $5,000, while high-end versions can reach $35,000 or more.\n\nMeanwhile, the Land Transport Authority has expanded the Park Connector Network which has made cycling safer and more appealing for both leisure and commuting.\n\nI know of a German chef who would cycle from Tampines to his workplace at a Sentosa hotel and back five days a week, rain or shine.\n\nLocal cyclists, however, only go out to play in good weather, usually in the early morning of weekends and public holidays.\n\nThey also seem to prefer the roads and this has resulted in motorists complaining about groups of cyclists hogging lanes.\n\nThis has not slowed down the cycling craze. Neither has police enforcement, or an accident or two.\n\nA year ago, a former colleague fell and fractured his jaw and smashed half of his teeth while riding on a road one morning.\n\nFor a few weeks, he resembled Frankenstein with the stitches around his lips, but the doctors did a good job, and he is okay now.\n\nGuess what? He’s back in the saddle. He says that the rhythmic motion of pedalling is soothing and enhances his physical and mental well-being.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority has now also curated a series of #ExploreSGRide cycling routes that feature scenic views and some iconic landmarks.\n\nThat will definitely inspire more people to merrily pedal off.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/673f029935a22b7963848942b02c107f4ca4d20e19aca7623421afeaa889bb7d?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAt just 12 years old, Ahyan Abdul Rahim is already dreaming of goals on the biggest stages – and he’s well on his way.\n\nThe young striker from Singapore scored twice at the recent LGSP Intercontinental Youth Cup in Porto, Portugal, where he represented Lion City Sailors (LCS) as part of their Under-12 team – the only Asian squad in a field of 20 elite European sides.\n\nIn chilly 10 deg C conditions, against teams like SC Braga, SL Benfica and Rio Ave, Ahyan stood out – not just as a promising forward, but as a player with real grit and game-changing potential.\n\nHis crowning moment came in LCS’s opening match against Rio Ave, when he scored a dramatic winner in the final five minutes and was named man of the match.\n\n“I saw the gap and just went for it,” he said, still beaming from the experience. “That goal meant a lot. It gave our team belief.”\n\nAhyan scored another crucial goal in a later fixture against SC Leixoes, helping LCS clinch a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe team ultimately won four of their seven matches and finished a respectable 12th overall. “Most of the European players were bigger and stronger,” Ahyan said. “But we didn’t let that stop us. We fought.”\n\nBorn and raised in Singapore, Ahyan’s journey began, like many local kids, kicking a ball around the void deck.\n\nInspired by his football-loving father, he took up the sport seriously at age six and has since progressed through local academies, including Flair Club and the Junior National Development Centre (JNDC), from where he was scouted to join LCS.\n\nThe LCS U-12 team’s head coach Hamqaamal Shah was full of praise: “Ahyan is confident, aggressive and thinks out of the box. He is skilful and likes to score goals. If he becomes more focused, he’ll be a good addition to the national team.”\n\nTraining four times a week at LCS’s Mattar base in MacPherson and competing every Sunday in the Youth Champions League, Ahyan is focused on growth.\n\n“I want to be a striker for Singapore – and one day, play for Manchester United,” he said with quiet determination. His idols? Cristiano Ronaldo and Spain’s teenage sensation Lamine Yamal.\n\nAhyan, a student of Oasis Primary School, recently secured a football scholarship to St Joseph’s International School, one of just six players selected this year.\n\nDespite battling hepatitis for several months in 2023, he’s bounced back strong, and his form is peaking again.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1c6cbd07d91eb00caf8c328fdbcf1a856715191c296a7ff94a4d5e0996e338a1?w=825", "alt_text": "Ahyan Abdul Rahim"}]}

Rahman, known for revolutionising Indian film music, has ventured into uncharted territory – virtual reality (VR) filmmaking.\n\nIn Singapore to present his directorial debut of Le Musk at Golden Village Suntec City, Rahman sat down for an exclusive interview with tabla! following the premiere of this ambitious project which combines immersive VR technology with sight, sound and scent, to tell the story.\n\n“People usually choose projects for commercial reasons,” Rahman said. “But Le Musk was different. It was something groundbreaking. A low-hanging fruit in a way – music, VR, scent – all combined. It was about creating something from India for the world.”\n\nDeveloped over seven years using advanced VR and scent technology, Le Musk is not just a film – it is a multi-sensory experience. Viewers watch it seated in a special motion chair with a VR headset, surrounded by spatial sound and infused with 12 distinct aromas that are woven into the film’s narrative. This innovation offers audiences an unprecedented way of experiencing cinema.\n\nPremiering Le Musk in Singapore held special significance for Rahman. “This is where I bought my first sequencer and sampler in 1986,” he fondly recalled. “It feels like coming full circle.”\n\nSingapore is also home to one of Rahman’s most passionate fan bases. “Singapore fans are crazy in a good way,” he laughed.\n\n“I hope those who experience Le Musk will share it with friends of all races and backgrounds. This project isn’t just Tamil or Hindi – it’s global. So I want people to bring their non-Indian friends too.”\n\nWhen asked how he has remained fearless in the face of new creative challenges, Rahman smiled and said: “I am my first fan. Even when I compose music, that’s how I start. I never worry whether fans will accept something new. That’s the only way to keep creating.”\n\nIn Le Musk, the audience sits in specially designed motion chairs equipped with scent dispensers.\n\nSaid Rahman: “It’s not in competition with traditional cinema. It’s a personal, immersive experience. Your full attention is required.”\n\nMindful of viewer comfort, Rahman’s team also took extra steps to eliminate common VR pitfalls such as motion sickness.\n\nThe film took seven years to complete and was produced across multiple countries. Shot in Rome, Bosnia, and Armenia, the production brought together teams from Chennai, Los Angeles, Mumbai and Ukraine.\n\nMusic was recorded in Budapest and a song was produced in Paris.\n\n“It’s a very international project,” Rahman said.\n\nThe story follows the journey of a woman drawn into a world of memory and mystery through the evocative power of scent.\n\nThe idea took root during a conversation in 2015 with friends and his ex-wife Saira in Los Angeles. Encouraged by friends from top technology firms, Rahman embarked on the bold venture.\n\nWhile Rahman has always embraced technology as a composer, this was his first time leading a full-fledged film production. He not only directed and co-wrote the story but also funded much of it himself.\n\n“The project ended up costing 40 to 50 times more than we expected. But somehow, the money came. An Arabic project came, doors opened, and we pushed forward,” he said.\n\n“We screened the demo in Los Angeles and then at the Cannes Film Festival’s Extended Reality section. The response was overwhelming, especially from non-Indian audiences.”\n\nIn 2024, Le Musk received the Monolith Awards at the Hollywood Infinity Festival for Best Cinematic Immersive Experience in recognition of its artistic and technical innovation.\n\nTrue to form, Rahman was deeply involved even in the physical aspects of the experience. The custom VR chairs used for Le Musk were initially very expensive – up to Rs 70 lakh each ($106,000). He later worked with a manufacturer in Coimbatore to bring down the cost to one third of the original quote.\n\nThough primarily a creative force, Rahman is assembling a team to handle the logistics of film production, hinting that more cinematic ventures may be on the horizon. “Once I have that next-gen team, I can focus purely on the creative side.”\n\nIn Le Musk, Rahman has created not just a film but a multi sensory experience that redefines what cinema can be. His journey from a musician to a trailblazing director proves one thing: for Rahman, innovation is a never-ending journey.\n\n“People usually choose projects for commercial reasons. But Le Musk was different. It was something groundbreaking. A low-hanging fruit in a way – music, VR, scent – all combined. It was about creating something from India for the world.”\n\nA.R.

Rahman is no stranger to reinvention. The musical maestro, who once redefined the soundscape of Indian cinema, has now stepped into the world of multi-sensory virtual reality with Le Musk, his directorial debut.\n\nBilled as a “cinematic sensory experience,” the 37-minute VR film promises a heady blend of music, memory, motion and smell.\n\nThe movie’s plot is an undeniably bold idea. Juliet Merdinian, an orphaned Armenian heiress and musician, journeys through a surreal world, chasing down the olfactory signatures of three mysterious men who wronged her in her childhood.\n\nThe concept, which was originally ideated by Saira Rahman, Rahman’s ex- wife, explores how scent is intertwined with identity and memory. With such a premise, Le Musk had the makings of a sensorial triumph.\n\nBut the experience, at least for me, did not quite live up to its ambition.\n\nFor starters, the music was underwhelming. It’s almost heretical to say, given Rahman’s legendary status, but the compositions in the short film lack the emotional depth and innovation we often associate with his best work.\n\nHis score, in which sounds of the tabla and synths flutter in the background, never quite soars. It feels functional, even ornamental, rather than immersive or memorable.\n\nThen there’s the technology itself. The film is experienced in Positron’s Voyager large pod-like red chairs, outfitted with haptic feedback, motion and scent dispersion. While theoretically fascinating, in practice, it was exhausting.\n\nThe VR headset is cumbersome, and its weight, especially over a prolonged session, had me fighting off a throbbing migraine.\n\nAdd to that the price: $40 for 37 minutes. That’s more than a full IMAX screening and a popcorn combo, with less than half the satisfaction.\n\nMoreover, there was no discernible scent (I ensured my nasal airways were not blocked before I made this claim).\n\nFor a film so deeply anchored in the idea of smell as a trigger for memory and identity, the absence of any noticeable aroma left a gaping hole in the experience. Perhaps my pod was faulty, as I did not catch even one of the 12 distinct scents promised. Without that, the “multi-sensory” claim felt more like a marketing gimmick than reality.\n\nYes, Le Musk premiered at Cannes and played at festivals in Los Angeles and Toronto, and even superstar Rajinikanth called it “mind-blowing” and “one-of-a-kind.”\n\nHowever, for an average audience member, especially someone curious but not particularly dazzled by tech for tech’s sake, the film leaves more questions than impact.\n\nFor all the technological speedbumps the world of cinema has traversed, this movie felt too amateurish for its time.\n\nYet, to be fair, Rahman deserves credit for venturing far from the comfort zone of mainstream Indian cinema.\n\nFew artists of his stature would gamble their legacy on a speculative format, let alone as a debut director. His courage to do so is what keeps creativity alive, even when the end result feels undercooked.\n\nLe Musk might not have succeeded in sweeping me off my feet – or my senses – but it does hint at a future where film is more than sight and sound.\n\nIf Rahman continues down this path, with sharper storytelling, more ergonomic gear and a sound that does his immense talent and legacy justice, his next multi-sensory experiment might be the one that truly sings.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aff35f94e60c6158690d29f5e7371f39bc67ff03783cddb66e4f631a37c6342b?w=825", "alt_text": "Journalist Reema Dudekula in a Positron Voyager pod, watching the movie."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8ac15da859b20b28f5f320879a09cd52caa018335ad33fcf0522a217e2841bf4?w=825", "alt_text": "Journalist Reema Dudekula in a Positron Voyager pod, watching the movie."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aff35f94e60c6158690d29f5e7371f39bc67ff03783cddb66e4f631a37c6342b?w=825", "alt_text": "Journalist Reema Dudekula in a Positron Voyager pod, watching the movie."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8ac15da859b20b28f5f320879a09cd52caa018335ad33fcf0522a217e2841bf4?w=825", "alt_text": "Journalist Reema Dudekula in a Positron Voyager pod, watching the movie."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aff35f94e60c6158690d29f5e7371f39bc67ff03783cddb66e4f631a37c6342b?w=825", "alt_text": "Journalist Reema Dudekula in a Positron Voyager pod, watching the movie."}]}

Police and forest officials were alerted immediately.\n\n“She was walking around the luxury tents and even the swimming pool before finally settling behind one of our private cottages,” said Mr Vishal, a manager at Hotel Machan. “We asked guests to stay indoors for their safety.”\n\nThe tigress was tranquilised by the Forest Department more than two hours after being located. She has now been confined to an enclosure within the park to prevent further danger to humans, reported NDTV.\n\nKankati has been linked to two fatal attacks in recent weeks, including the killing of forest ranger Devendra Chaudhary on May 11 near the Jogi Mahal area and the mauling of a seven-year-old boy, Kartik Suman, near the Trinetra Ganesh Temple on April 16.\n\n“She is suspected to have attacked both victims, prompting serious safety concerns,” said Mr Bharat, an officer at Kundera Police Station. “Today we were lucky. Over 100 people had gathered to see her. She was agitated, and things could have gone very wrong.”\n\nMr Rajendra Mali, the head of a neighbouring village, criticised the Forest Department for prioritising tourism over wildlife monitoring. “Tiger sightings outside the park are becoming too frequent. We need stronger safeguards for people living along the park’s edge,” he said.\n\nThe incident has once again highlighted the dangers of human-animal conflict in areas adjacent to wildlife reserves. With tiger numbers on the rise and habitat corridors narrowing, encounters between tigers and humans have become increasingly common in and around Ranthambore.\n\nIn response to the recent attacks, the Rajasthan government has formed a six-member committee to oversee day-to-day monitoring and technical support, following guidelines from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).\n\nThe committee includes Chief Conservator of Forests P. Kathirvel from Bharatpur and will aim to prevent further such incidents.\n\nForest officials have urged local residents and tourists to remain cautious. “If a tiger strays into a village, people should avoid gathering outside.

Dhoni, Dhoni succeeded Sourav Ganguly. But now?\n\nThe race for India’s next Test captain is wide open, with Jasprit Bumrah, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant and K.L. Rahul emerging as the leading contenders.\n\nBut for the selectors it isn’t just about picking a name – it’s about picking a vision.\n\nIndia is heading into a five-Test series against England next month, and the World Test Championship (WTC) cycle looms. The new skipper must be tactically sharp, mentally resilient and a consistent performer.\n\nIf this decision were based purely on cricketing acumen and respect in the dressing room, Bumrah would already have the job.\n\nHe’s India’s bowling lynchpin, has captained the team in three Tests and demonstrated poise and sharp tactical thinking. He even led India to a thumping win against Australia in Perth earlier this year.\n\nBut here’s the problem: Bumrah’s body can’t guarantee five Tests in six weeks, especially in conditions like England.\n\nHis workload is managed meticulously by the Indian board (BCCI) to prevent another stress fracture.\n\nFormer coach Ravi Shastri summed it up best: “I don’t want Jasprit to be made captain, and then you lose him as a bowler.”\n\nAs former Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin said, it will be tragic if Bumrah never gets to lead, but unless Indian cricket is willing to rotate captains mid-series, naming a part-time skipper isn’t sustainable.\n\nNext up is Gill – with a certain inevitability to his captaincy future.\n\nHe’s 25, has captained Gujarat Titans with composure in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and boasts the temperament of a leader-in-waiting. Both Shastri and Ashwin consider him a long-term option.\n\nBut Test cricket isn’t just about being composed. It’s about scoring runs – especially away from home.\n\nGill averages just 25 in SENA countries  – South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia – which are the ultimate proving grounds for any batter, and hasn’t crossed 50 in Tests outside Asia since 2021. His lone overseas century came against Bangladesh.\n\nIs it wise to hand over the reins to someone who hasn’t locked down his place in the playing XI? The selectors will have to carefully weigh this factor.\n\nIndia tried this before with Rahul Dravid and Ajinkya Rahane, both elegant batters but too mellow for leadership.\n\nThe conversation next turns to Pant, who, at 27, is India’s most impactful Test cricketer in recent memory.\n\nCenturies in Australia, England and South Africa. A fearless presence behind the stumps. And yes, leadership experience with Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL.\n\nPant has returned to top-level cricket after a horrific car accident in 2022. While his IPL 2025 wasn’t spectacular, his place in India’s Test XI is unquestioned.\n\nHe is one of the few players in world cricket who can change a game in a session.\n\nThe pushback against Pant is consistency and temperament – but let’s face it, Indian cricket has often thrived under unconventional leaders.\n\nDhoni wasn’t polished either when he started. Pant’s energy, aggression and growing maturity make him a compelling choice.\n\nBut there are also Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja – the wildcards.\n\nRahul has led India before and offers versatility, but his Test spot is under threat. He’s been in and out of the squad and hasn’t strung together enough consistent runs to be the leader India needs.\n\nJadeja, the team’s most senior player, has also been floated as a short-term option.\n\nAshwin endorsed him as a “transition captain” to mentor Gill. It’s not the worst idea – Jadeja is seasoned, sharp and respected.\n\nBut neither Rahul nor Jadeja screams “future”. India needs someone who can build a legacy, not just plug a gap.\n\nAccording to reports, informal conversations have taken place with both Gill and Pant, but the BCCI remains divided. One camp is concerned about Gill’s overseas record. The other questions Pant’s judgment.\n\nIt’s a genuine leadership crossroads, made even tougher by the simultaneous exits of Rohit, Kohli and Ashwin.\n\nEven the great Sunil Gavaskar admitted the selectors have no clear path. “It will take a few years to reach the levels of our previous captains,” he said.\n\nBut the process must start now.\n\nMost experts believe, if Bumrah is fully fit and available for most of the WTC cycle, he should be India’s Test captain. But if his body can’t keep up with the format, it’s time for India to be bold.\n\nMake Pant captain, Bumrah his vice-captain and sounding board, and start grooming Gill as the heir.\n\nThat way, India has a three-pronged leadership core – one that blends experience, charisma and continuity.\n\nPant has the most firepower, Bumrah the tactical nous and Gill the time to grow.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/145a41d4edd84be44c5ce7e21a95b7a4fccf7cf190c46f471c05d6539c6a5286?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6510ce9d05e183120fa12d4d2067deaafeff1014a910b20a2c283a9e14bc4a9b?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7248e00d4c9edb7a9af77823921651ddcd034ea4b6dff1ce5b7111439fe64798?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/145a41d4edd84be44c5ce7e21a95b7a4fccf7cf190c46f471c05d6539c6a5286?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/6510ce9d05e183120fa12d4d2067deaafeff1014a910b20a2c283a9e14bc4a9b?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7248e00d4c9edb7a9af77823921651ddcd034ea4b6dff1ce5b7111439fe64798?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/145a41d4edd84be44c5ce7e21a95b7a4fccf7cf190c46f471c05d6539c6a5286?w=825", "alt_text": "Jasprit Bumrah, Shubhman Gill and Rishabh Pant"}]}

One lost his life. The other, her ability to walk.\n\nWhat was meant to be a joyful celebration before graduation turned into heartbreak when 25-year-old Gaurav Jaisingh, a finance student at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts, fell to his death from a hotel balcony in the Bahamas on May 11.\n\nThe Indian-American student was part of the university’s annual senior trip at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort when the accident occurred, reported The Times of India.\n\nAccording to the Royal Bahamas Police Force, Gaurav was inside a hotel room with several roommates when he accidentally fell from an upper-level balcony. He was found unresponsive on a lower floor and died while being rushed to hospital.\n\nOriginally from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, Gaurav was well-regarded on campus for his leadership roles in the Delta Sigma Pi fraternity, the South Asian Students Association, and as a tour guide and orientation leader.\n\nHe was due to graduate just six days later and had secured a consulting job in New York.\n\n“This is an enormous tragedy for our community,” Bentley University said in a statement. “We share our deepest condolences with Gaurav’s family, friends and loved ones.”\n\nHis fellow students mourned his death at commencement, describing him as “driven, kind and deeply loved.”\n\nIn a parallel tragedy, 21-year-old Bandna Bhatti, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, was left paralysed from the waist down after falling from an external staircase during a fraternity party on April 19, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\nBandna, who was just three weeks away from graduating with a degree in Data Science, fell nearly four metres and landed on a narrow passageway outside the frat house while striking her head on the way down.\n\nAfter the tragic fall, she lay there for 15 minutes before she was found by people and taken inside.\n\nHer family claimed that those who took her inside were asked to leave the party by her friends.

To join the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).\n\n“I want to serve my country and prove that people like me don’t need sympathy – we need empathy and opportunity,” she said.\n\nHer path has been anything but easy. Years of treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi delayed her education. It wasn’t until 2016 that she could resume school – jumping straight from Class 2 to Class 6.\n\nShe embraced audio books, online resources, and sheer determination to learn. Her Class 10 score? A remarkable 95.2 per cent.\n\n“I study two to three hours a day. It was hard in the beginning, but I kept going. I knew I had to work harder because I have fewer options,” she told NDTV.\n\nHer father Pawan, a peon at the Haryana Secretariat, and mother Suman, a homemaker, studied only till Class 5. Yet, they were determined to give Kafi the education they never had.\n\n“They’ve sacrificed everything for me. This result is as much theirs as mine,” Kafi said.\n\nJustice, however, has remained elusive. The attackers who robbed her of her sight still roam free.\n\n“Our legal fight is on,” she said quietly. “But I’ll study hard, become an IAS officer, and fight my own case one day.”\n\nKafi isn’t the only star from her school. Sumant Poddar and Gursharan Singh scored 94 per cent and 93.6 per cent respectively.\n\nIn Class 10, Sunny Kumar Chauhan led with 86.2 per cent, followed by Sanskriti Sharma at 82.6 per cent and Nitika with 78.6 per cent.\n\nFor the visually impaired, finding the right study material remains a major hurdle. Audiobooks in Hindi are rare, and Braille materials are limited, reported NDTV.\n\nGursharan said he often had friends record books for him. “But it made me stronger,” he added.\n\nKafi’s story stands out not just for her academic brilliance, but for the powerful message she carries: that resilience can outshine even the darkest scars.\n\nHer words are simple but unforgettable: “We don’t have many choices. So we study. And we achieve.”\n\n“I want to serve my country and prove that people like me don’t need sympathy – we need empathy and opportunity.”\n\nKafi", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/30d11141a4638b1f764d0b4313525d3c6324372b2a90f6f48a3cc8be0c7c43a5?w=825", "alt_text": "Kafi with her parents."}]}

Renting rehearsal studios, sharing performance venues, and working around logistical constraints.\n\nToday, the founder of AGAM Theatre Lab stands at the entrance of a purpose-built 110-seater blackbox theatre, Singapore’s first dedicated space for Tamil and Indian performing arts – marking a turning point not only for his company, but for the country’s cultural landscape.\n\nNamed The Theatre Lab, the 3,111 square feet venue is located above the Singapore Art Museum at 39 Tanjong Pagar Distripark.\n\nThe milestone was celebrated in April with a black-tie launch event, attended by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong.\n\n“Spaces like these are essential for nurturing talent and preserving our cultural heritage. They ensure that our artistic communities continue to grow and flourish,” said Mr Tong.\n\nMr Ganesh told tabla!: “This is more than a theatre. It’s a permanent home for Tamil theatre, a space where we can dream, create and build for the future.”\n\nThe new blackbox offers a flexible, professional-grade performance environment with retractable seating, advanced lighting and acoustics, and the capacity to host not just shows but artist residencies, workshops and rehearsals.\n\n“Now I have my own space, which I can call home,” said Mr Ganesh.\n\nThe theatre group found this new space in September last year, after operating from a rented studio at Goodman Arts Centre for five years.\n\n“The space is like an artiste’s playground. We also want young artistes to actively rent the space and use the facilities to explore their creativity,” said Mr Ganesh.\n\nWith its own venue, the company is also able to run shows for a longer duration.\n\n“I’m always afraid to book a space for a longer period of time. But now, with my own space I can host as many shows as I want,” said Mr Ganesh.\n\nAGAM is Singapore’s only Tamil-language theatre company and is able to receive tax-deductible donations.\n\nSince its founding, AGAM has quietly transformed the landscape of Tamil performing arts in Singapore.\n\nIn 2023, the company made history by becoming the first Tamil theatre group to win the ST Life! Theatre Award for Best Ensemble, with its production Twin Murder in the Green Mansion.\n\nIt was awarded charity status in September 2020 and the group has raised more than $400,000 for the new space from more than 100 donors.\n\nThe intimate venue allows guests, including artistes, patrons and cultural leaders to experience the production up close, highlighting its unique capacity for immersive storytelling.\n\n“This space gives us artistic freedom. We don’t have to compromise on vision anymore,” said Mr Ganesh.\n\n“This is more than a theatre.

I cook meals for him three to four times a week,” said Madam Magdalene.\n\n“I live for my children and do whatever I can for them. I love them very much.”\n\nIt is a tremendous effort for her, as she herself often feels giddy and has limited mobility. She has a walking frame near the kitchen in case she needs support. She has no domestic helper.\n\nWith the groceries she receives every Thursday through Food from the Heart (an initiative which donates food to the needy), she prepares simple meals for Mr Christopher, such as eggs, porridge, fried vegetables and soups.\n\nMr Christopher himself has limited mobility and relies on a Personal Mobility Device when he goes out.\n\nOn the days when he is too weak to go to his mother’s flat to pick up his meals, Madam Magdalene enlists the help of home personal care personnel from Swami Home or volunteers from Blossom Seeds to pass it to him.\n\nFor many years, she was the caregiver for her husband, Mr Finian, who died in 2023 after suffering from pneumonia and kidney and heart problems.\n\nThings were not much easier when she was younger.\n\n“We were not well-off, so I had to work three jobs to support the family. I worked in a childcare centre in the morning, did office work in the afternoon and worked at a coffeeshop till 11pm at night.”\n\nShe eventually stopped working at the age of 71 as she contracted pneumonia.\n\nReferring to his mother as his “pillar of support”, Mr Christopher was visibly thankful to have his mother’s love and care.\n\nHer hair may have turned grey, skin wrinkled and legs weakened, but Madam Magdalene’s love for her children is everlasting.\n\n12,000 flowers given out for Mother’s Day\n\nMr Christopher Rodrigues’ beautiful gesture of giving flowers to his mother was part of a Mother’s Day distribution organised by Boss Group – a group of entrepreneurs – and Blossom Seeds, a charity.\n\nThe carnation flowers were lovingly handcrafted by people with special needs and seniors.\n\nThis was the 16th year that the Boss Group was organising this flower distribution programme.\n\nIt distributed 12,000 flowers to mothers and seniors.\n\nMadam Sarasuathy Gopal Naidu, 73, who was at Blossom Seeds Active Ageing Centre for its Mother’s Day celebration on May 9, was happy that mothers like her were honoured.\n\nA former police officer, she works as a security officer six days a week while juggling her role as a caregiver for her husband who has health issues.\n\n“Although I get little rest, I am thankful that my family appreciates my love for them,” she said.\n\nMs Muthiah Parvathi, 71, volunteers with Blossom Seeds as a medical escort, accompanying seniors living alone to the doctor five times a week.\n\n“For Mother’s Day, my sons and daughters-in-law buy gifts for me, and I do the same.

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingaporean artist and architect Lakshmi Mohanbabu has achieved what few in the world have imagined.\n\nHer latest creation, a set of stainless steel cubes titled Deep Ocean Interactions, has been installed a staggering 7,192 metres below sea level, near the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDeployed on December 12, 2024, the art installation marks the deepest underwater art placement in human history.\n\nWith this, Singapore becomes the first nation to have artistic works both orbiting in space and submerged in the planet’s deepest ocean zones.\n\nThe milestone is not just an artistic triumph, but a powerful collaboration between science, engineering and culture.\n\nThe project was executed in partnership with Singapore’s NuStar Technologies, Japan’s JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology), and researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\n\nTogether, they integrated the artwork into the Long-Term Borehole Monitoring System (LTBMS), a seismic observation system that improves early warning for undersea earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nEach cube measures 10cm per side and features Ms Lakshmi’s “Universal Language of Symbols”, an artistic expression of nine universal elements – Creation, Lifecycles, Colour, Shape, Movement, Direction, Energy, Space and Time.\n\nThe installation is a part of her broader Interactions series, a long-running project that seeks to connect humanity through shared existential themes.\n\n“This isn’t just about placing art in extreme environments. It’s about shared journeys, shared purpose, and a universal story,” said Ms Lakshmi. “The symbols on the cubes aren’t owned by any culture – they’re for all of us.”\n\nOf the three cubes, one was crafted using cutting-edge 3D printing technology developed at NTU’s Singapore Centre for 3D Printing.\n\nThe LAPIS (Laser Patterning and Incorporation of Sheets) method allowed researchers to fuse 80 ultra-thin stainless steel layers into a single cube with walls just 4mm thick – 70 per cent stronger than conventional steel and capable of withstanding crushing deep-sea pressure.\n\nAssistant Professor Lai Changquan, who led the NTU team, noted the broader potential of the technology, especially in high-performance industries like aerospace and marine engineering. A startup has already been formed to commercialise the innovation.\n\n“This is the third time I’ve collaborated with NTU,” said Ms Lakshmi. “We always set out to blur the lines between art and science – to do something the world hasn’t seen.”\n\nBorn in Thiruvananthapuram, India, and trained in architecture and fashion, Ms Lakshmi has spent decades working across India and Singapore, combining design, technology and philosophy in her art.\n\nHer previous achievements include sending miniatures of the same symbolic artwork to the International Space Station in 2022 as part of the Moon Gallery initiative.\n\nAnd she’s not done yet.\n\nThe same five designs that have now reached both space and the deep ocean will be launched to the Moon in 2025, making Ms Lakshmi the only artist with work on Earth, in orbit, under the ocean and – soon – on the Moon.\n\nBut her vision doesn’t stop with far-off extremes. She’s already planning to bring this universal language of symbols to global cities in forms that resonate locally – like chocolate-toned installations in Switzerland, or glass-inspired structures in the Czech Republic.\n\n“Some people ask why I’d place art somewhere humans can’t reach,” said Ms Lakshmi. “But it’s about the story. Just like the Mona Lisa is known worldwide despite few seeing it in person, these artworks are about connection – not location.”\n\nThe feat has drawn praise from leaders in both art and science. NuStar managing director Goi Kim Kok called it a “landmark fusion of culture and innovation,” noting the special significance ahead of the 60th anniversary of Singapore-Japan diplomatic relations.\n\nSingapore’s SG60 celebrations this year underscore the country’s transformation into a global hub for innovation and imagination. For Ms Lakshmi, her project is a reflection of that spirit.\n\n“Singapore is my home now. It’s where different minds, cultures, and disciplines come together,” she said. “This project is about what’s possible when we dream beyond limits.”\n\nCaption...\n\nPhotos:", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8b055df64a657e1a842d00797d0b4746b9cf58f6690dd370d54bc618311eea3b?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Lakshmi Mohanbabu with a replica of the stainless steel cube that was placed deep in the ocean."}]}

We had to be very stable when landing.”\n\nMr Murugan hopes to carry his project into the industry, specifically the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).\n\nIn April, he enlisted as a regular with the RSN.\n\n“I did not want this project to just remain as a hobbyist project,” he said. “I want it to solve real-world problems.

Manifesting wealth is sought after in Singapore, so attendance was full.\n\nI went in thinking I am ready to spiritually manipulate the universe to swing things my way. The guru fired the first salvo.\n\nWe don’t need to pray for abundance in the future tense, he said. If you do, you are admitting to an absence of wealth. Pray for abundance in the present like you already have it. And it will come!\n\nHmm… I do get confused when wise men preach but I think there’s a method in there somewhere.\n\nContemplating this, I joined the buffet line. They had laid out a delicious spread that could feed an army, including mango ras, my favourite, that wasn’t even in season. That, I thought, must surely count as a manifestation of abundance for the evening.\n\nAs it turns out, the universe wasn’t done with me.  That week, I found myself attending not one, but two milestone birthday parties of friends – one turning 84, and another a magnificent 87.\n\nHow did they get there? An abundance of good genes that you can’t manifest for the price of gold. True but there’s more to it than that.\n\nThe gentleman who turned 84 is a dignified Malayalee I’ve known for years – soft-spoken, witty, well-read and a committed Rotarian.\n\nHis birthday party wasn’t any old birthday party. Oh no! The invitation said: “In Kerala culture, this milestone is known as Satabhishekham and marks a person having witnessed 1008 moons.”\n\nThat’s a lot of moons to conduct some serious abundance manifestation!\n\nSo how did my friend score on that front? Five speeches by old friends and family sorted that out.\n\nTurns out he used a cunning plan to game the manifestation system – he GAVE abundantly in money, in time, in friendship, in partnership and in dad jokes!\n\nHe did this consistently through his entire life as appropriate to each of his ashrams, through the Brahmacharya (bachelor), Grihasta (family man) and in Vanaprastha (retirement), and boy did he get paid back in spades.\n\nHe can safely slip into Sanyasa knowing that his abundance chickens have come home to roost in the form of respect, love and jingle in his pocket.\n\nThe other party I attended was as colourful, with good food and wine flowing (got to watch out for fatty liver!)\n\nAs I muah muahed my way around the tables, I noticed that there were four generations of guests excited enough about the birthday boy to be doing slide presentations, making TikTok videos and creating a happy chaos.\n\nEveryone was involved, smiling, helping out in little ways. They weren’t here out of an obligation – they wanted to be here!\n\nAnd in that moment I thought, is this abundance? Not an Ardmore penthouse, not a Bentley, not a Patek Phillipe, but a room full of people who love you enough to rehearse speeches, and even roast you in front of your friends to huge laughter and applause.\n\nAnd then, just when I thought the evening couldn’t get more poetic, they introduced “The Terrible Four”.\n\nApparently, these were the birthday boy’s closest friends since his school days – a formidable group of mischief-makers who’d survived college, heartbreaks, promotions, children, cholesterol and (just barely) technology.\n\nThey were called the “Terrible Four” – a nickname the birthday boy had apparently coined in the 1960s when they wore bell-bottoms and chased girls who wanted nothing to do with them.\n\nNow well into their late 80s they were reunited for this special day. One was wheeled in, another arrived with a walking stick, one still drove himself (to the horror of his family) and the fourth was late as usual, because, as his wife announced loudly: “He forgot to wear his hearing aid.”\n\nThere they sat. The Terrible Four, glasses of whisky in hand, not a single word spoken. Not out of awkwardness – but comfort.\n\nThey didn’t need words. These were friends who had been through weddings, funerals, promotions, children’s heartbreaks, cholesterol checkups, political arguments and long WhatsApp forwards. They’d said all they needed to say in the past sixty years. Now, they just needed to be.\n\nI watched them and thought again: Is this abundance?\n\nIs it the peace of having nothing to prove? The joy of just being with people who have seen you at your worst and loved you through it? Is it this unspoken understanding that no matter how long the silence, the friendship will never fade?\n\nSome say abundance is about having more. More money. More stuff. But maybe it’s also about having enough.\n\nEnough  people who remember your stories.\n\nEnough friends who still call you “idiot” with affection.\n\nEnough memories to fill a room.\n\nThe kind of abundance I witnessed at those birthday parties  wasn’t loud or luxurious. It was gentle, warm, sweet, pretty much like the gajar halwa served for dessert.\n\nIt was in the laughter of an 87-year-old man surrounded by his stories. In the quiet satisfaction of his wife. In the youthful exuberant love of his progeny. In the nods and clinks of whisky glasses between the Terrible Four. In sneakily whacking a second slice of birthday cake after everyone’s been fed.\n\nAbundance, I realised, is not always about acquiring more. It’s about recognising the riches that are already around you – and within you.\n\nI may never fully manifest abundance the way the guru explained. But if I can laugh with old friends, celebrate one more birthday, and sit in quiet joy with the ones I love over 1008 moons, then that my dear friends would be abundance!", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9062ea3ed3499d5bb2ffdc3638eb57f31ab37391fdfb87411a42afeb72ee02be?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn a week that has left Indian cricket fans stunned, two of the sport’s biggest icons – Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma – walked away from Test cricket, signalling the end of an era.\n\nTheir back-to-back retirements have not only left a void in India’s batting order but also created a leadership vacuum at the top.\n\nAs the country prepares for a gruelling five-Test tour of England beginning June 20, questions abound: Is India ready for this transition? Who steps up now? And, most importantly, can the team cope without its two modern-day greats?\n\nKohli, with his unmatched passion and aggression, and Rohit, with his calm precision and evolving leadership, have been pillars of Indian Test cricket for over a decade.\n\nKohli’s departure, in particular, felt like a jolt. In 123 Tests, he amassed 9,230 runs, including 30 centuries and seven double hundreds – numbers that place him among the elite in world cricket.\n\nBut, more than stats, it was his intensity and the aura he brought to the whites that made him a fan favourite and a feared opponent.\n\nRohit, who made his Test debut in 2013, found his stride later when he was promoted as an opener in 2019. Since then, he scored 4,301 runs in 67 matches and led India to a World Test Championship final.\n\nThough not as flamboyant as Kohli, Rohit’s contribution in anchoring the top order and leading India through a transition, post-Kohli’s captaincy, was immense.\n\nWhat’s most surprising is the abruptness of their exits. While reports suggested the Indian board (BCCI) had already hinted to Rohit that his time in red-ball cricket was up, Kohli’s decision seemed more personal.\n\nAccording to sources, Kohli had planned to retire after the England series but decided to walk away earlier, possibly influenced by internal dynamics and the upcoming leadership shuffle.\n\nAll-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin, who himself retired recently, admitted that both Kohli and Rohit had more to offer.\n\n“There’s definitely a leadership vacuum now,” he said. “Virat’s energy and Rohit’s composure will be missed. Kohli still had one or two years left in him.”\n\nWith these departures, India’s Test team now faces a complete reset. The torch is expected to pass to 25-year-old Shubman Gill, a stylish right-hander seen as the heir apparent.\n\nGill has shown glimpses of brilliance – 1,893 runs in 32 Tests – but his overseas average of 29.50 raises concerns.\n\nHe is likely to go in at No. 3, with the opening duties going to the experienced KL Rahul and the promising Yashasvi Jaiswal. The middle-order will be entrusted to Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz Khan and Karun Nair.\n\nThe question of captaincy looms large. Gill is a strong contender, but Jasprit Bumrah, who has led India in two Tests, remains in the conversation.\n\nHowever, Bumrah’s injury history and the demanding English tour schedule may rule him out as a full-time option.\n\nPant, though charismatic, has seen his leadership credentials dented by his inconsistent Indian Premier League performances.\n\nIndia hasn’t won a Test series in England since 2007, and without Kohli’s fiery resilience and Rohit’s solidity at the top, the road ahead is rocky.\n\nThe task of overseeing this transition now falls on head coach Gautam Gambhir. Known for his fierce attitude and clarity of thought, Gambhir must now rebuild the team culture and instill belief in a new generation.\n\nHowever, his red-ball record has been underwhelming. India’s loss to New Zealand at home and a forgettable Down Under campaign have raised concerns about tactical depth.\n\nStill, if there’s one man who understands the pressures of transitions, it’s Gambhir – a player who stood tall during India’s 2011 World Cup win and the 2007 T20 World Cup.\n\nUnder him, can India transition smoothly after decades of relying on the old guard?\n\nThe fans are anxious, and the expectations are massive.\n\n“There’s definitely a leadership vacuum now. Virat’s energy and Rohit’s composure will be missed. Kohli still had one or two years left in him.”\n\nFormer India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/197c5f226aa0dd30d60081c010a59d11d787c3c147792e27e383025295619947?w=825", "alt_text": "Rohit Sharma (left) and Virat Kohli."}]}

He believed in reaching places that were often overlooked and using cricket to create opportunity and community.”\n\nFrom his days as a student at St Patrick’s School in Singapore, where he first picked up a bat and donned the wicketkeeper’s gloves, Arjun charted an extraordinary journey. After representing Singapore at youth and senior levels, he pursued a degree in sports management and later ventured into coaching abroad, starting with a groundbreaking stint in Chile.\n\nA five-year tenure with the Singapore Cricket Association followed, where he served as game development manager and later, head coach.\n\nHis crowning moment came in 2017, when he led the Singapore national team to its first-ever SEA Games gold in cricket. “One of the proudest moments of my life,” he recalled in a 2021 interview, describing the feeling of hearing the national anthem during the medal ceremony.\n\nYet, Arjun’s impact was never confined to the pitch. In Malawi, he was known not only for uplifting cricket but also for supporting vulnerable communities.\n\nOne of his most cherished contributions was helping improve conditions at the Maoni Orphanage, where he raised funds to buy beds and mosquito nets for the children. “He never ignored what he saw around him – he acted,” said his sister.\n\nTributes from the cricket world have highlighted Arjun’s profound influence on people and the game alike.\n\n“Arjun Menon was far more than a passionate cricket professional – he was a tireless advocate for the sport,” said Prakash Vijayakumar, former CEO of Indonesian Cricket Association and Singapore Cricket Association (SCA). “His dedication to cricket was equalled only by his warmth. His passing is a profound loss to Singapore and to all who had the privilege of knowing him.”\n\nFormer Singapore captain Chetan Suryawanshi described Arjun as “a truly generous soul who carried Singapore in his heart no matter where he went,” adding: “I will always remember him not just as a mentor, but as a great human being.”\n\nArjun is survived by his Zimbabwean wife Patience, 39, his parents Gopinath and Nandini Menon, and his sisters Prema and Maya. A cremation ceremony was held in Malawi on Thursday, with a memorial in Singapore scheduled for May 31.\n\nV.K.

Santosh Kumar\n\nJudge my record not my rank\n\nMember of Parliament Dinesh Vasu Dash, a former brigadier-general in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), has found himself at the heart of an old national conversation: should former military men enter politics?\n\nThe People’s Action Party has long tapped into the ranks of the military for political talent.\n\nBut in recent years, there has been growing criticism that these ex-officers – sometimes branded “paper Generals” – lack the lived experience and grassroots touch needed in civilian life.\n\nMr Dinesh, 50, who won a seat in East Coast GRC in the May 3 general election, disagrees. And he’s not shying away from the scrutiny.\n\n“I’m not a paper General,” he boldly told tabla! during an interview at an East Coast food centre on May 6.\n\n“I had 18 rockets fired at me by the Taliban. I’ve seen what real conflict looks like. That’s not something you fake in a boardroom.”\n\nMr Dinesh’s credentials go beyond theory. In 2009, he spent eight months in Afghanistan, embedded with Dutch NATO forces in Uruzgan province, one of the more volatile regions bordering Pakistan.\n\nDuring the deployment, his camp endured frequent attacks, indirect fire and suicide bomb threats. One rocket missed his bunk by a few metres.\n\nSaid Mr Dinesh: “The rockets were fired over many nights. The one that landed the closest flew over me, so we could hear it, but it landed just outside my bunk.\n\n“You’d hear the explosion and then five minutes later, it would rain gravel and debris. It teaches you what stress really is. I came back with PTS (post-traumatic stress) – enough to wake up in the middle of the night, thinking you’re under attack.\n\n“My wife would tell me that I would regularly spring up in the middle of the night, triggered by alarm. It was quite normal, and went on for the first six months after I got back.”\n\nThis, he says, fundamentally shaped his resilience and deepened his sense of service – traits he believes are equally valuable in politics.\n\nAsked about the common critique that generals are too rigid, too removed or too institutionalised for the messiness of politics, Mr Dinesh is quick to call out a double standard.\n\n“Why is there no criticism when senior counsels enter politics? There’s no training school for politicians – we’re all new when we start. So examine the person, not the past profession,” he said.\n\nHe argued that military leaders – especially those who have served in high-pressure, operational environments – often possess skills that are directly transferable to governance: strategic thinking, calmness under pressure and a deep appreciation for national interest over individual gain.\n\n“It’s not about command-and-control. It’s about clarity, cohesion and commitment,” he said. “Leading 25,000 troops in a division – as I did in the SAF – is not unlike managing a constituency of 30,000 people. You learn to listen, empathise and act.”\n\nFar from being insulated, Mr Dinesh insisted that his military career connected him to people on the ground – literally. During the election campaign, several former national servicemen recognised him.\n\n“They would stop me and say, ‘Sir, remember me, I was a soldier in your battalion’. That kind of bond is forged in the field not in air-conditioned offices,” he said.\n\nMr Dinesh acknowledged, though, that the transition from military to politics does come with cultural adjustments.\n\n“If you enter politics straight from the SAF, the civilian pace and tone may take some getting used to,” he admitted. “I had five years in between – with the Ministry of Health and as CEO of the Agency for Integrated Care after I left the army in 2020 – so I’ve been thoroughly civilianised. Most people are shocked to find out I was in the army at all.”\n\nSingapore, Mr Dinesh argued, is too small and too complex for labels to determine someone’s suitability for leadership.\n\n“There’s a kind of ‘wokeness’ to the criticism of generals. It assumes that we’re somehow less capable of connecting with people or understanding their needs. That’s not fair,” he said.\n\n“I’ve worked through Covid with four hours of sleep for two years – managing health crises, elderly care and frontline coordination. That’s real-world, high-stakes leadership.”\n\nAnd his connection to the ground isn’t just rhetorical. “If anything, I’ve been one of the most outspoken civil servants,” he said. “I’ve never been one to sugarcoat issues. I’ve criticised policies from within, not just nodded along.”\n\nFar from the stoic stereotype of a commander, Mr Dinesh’s personality defies easy categorisation.\n\nHe loves heavy metal music “the hardcore anti-establishment type,” he pointed out – and has little patience for political niceties. “I’m not the type who will shy away from difficult situations,” he said. “I will take them head on.”\n\nMr Dinesh’s military resume is dotted with high-stakes roles. Beyond Afghanistan, he was the ground commander during the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore in 2018.\n\nHe sat alongside the police commissioner, coordinating bomb squads and security for two of the world’s most unpredictable leaders.\n\nIn 2015, he had the sombre honour of serving as the lead coffin bearer, the only Indian, in the state funeral of Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n“It was a moment of deep significance for me,” he said. “To honour the man who built the country I now serve in a different capacity.”\n\nMr Dinesh also spent a formative year (2006-2007) in India attending the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, Tamil Nadu, where he listened to an “illuminating” talk by then-President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and gained insights into India’s evolving defence and geopolitical landscape.\n\nIt was also the time when India’s first field marshal Sam Manekshaw, who was the chief of the army staff during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, was receiving treatment at the military hospital in Wellington, before he died at the age of 94 a year later.\n\n“It was a cultural and strategic immersion,” said Mr Dinesh, even as he got up several times from our table during the interview to receive congratulations and chat with the residents of East Coast. “It gave me a unique understanding of the India-Pakistan-China dynamics which, given current global tensions, is invaluable.”\n\nHis travels took him to Kashmir, Ladakh and the Line of Control – frontline exposure that gave him a broader perspective on national security and diplomacy.\n\nNow, as a first-time MP, Mr Dinesh hopes to bring that same sense of strategic clarity and moral courage to policy.\n\n“I’m not here to warm a seat. I’ve been in firefights – real ones. I’ve coordinated public health responses. I’ve carried a nation’s founding father. If you think I’m not ready to walk the ground and serve my residents, then you haven’t been paying attention,” he said.\n\nHe’s keen on issues related to elder care, youth empowerment and community mental health – areas he dealt with at AIC.\n\n“There’s dignity in every life stage,” he said. “As a society, we must learn to support both the young and the old, not just economically, but emotionally.”\n\nMr Dinesh offered a challenge: “Judge me not by my rank, but by my record. I didn’t come into this for prestige. I came in because I care.”\n\nMr Dinesh Vasu Dash (right), then an SAF Brigadier-General, with the Indian Army’s Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Manoj Pande at Visakhapatnam, India, in November 2018.

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/news/singapore/heart-indian-community-issues", "site_title": "Heart for Indian community issues", "publish_date": null, "content": "News\n\nHeart for Indian community issues\n\nUPDATED\n\nMay 8, 2025, 7:01 PM\n\nMr Dinesh Vasu Dash and his wife Rathiga Velaithan during election campaigning.\n\nPhoto: Dinesh Vasu Dash\n\nV.K. Santosh Kumar\n\nIntegration and upliftment within the Indian community is something close to the heart of Mr Dinesh Vasu Dash.\n\n“We have a problem,” he said, noting that Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had, at a youth dialogue last month, praised the Singapore Indian community for punching above its weight.\n\n“If the Indian community continues to fracture – between North and South Indians, locals and expats – we will not be able to punch above our weight in the future, as we have in the past.”\n\nMr Dinesh is particularly concerned about the divide between locally born Singapore Indians and the new wave of immigrants from India – many of whom are well-educated professionals in high-paying jobs.\n\nThey live in their own circles, their own condos, eat in different places, he observed. “And meanwhile, some local Indian families are struggling – socially, economically, even educationally.\n\nHe warned that without concerted efforts to build bridges, Singapore risks importing the divisions of the subcontinent.\n\n“We are inheriting the fractures of India. North versus South. Tamil versus Hindi. Caste hierarchies that don’t belong here,” he said.\n\n“It does not matter to me if you are a local Indian or a foreign-born Indian. As long as you are a Singaporean, it doesn’t matter to me if you’re a North Indian or a South Indian, because all of us are together, and we need to find ways to bring everybody together.”\n\nHis solution? Honest, community-led conversations and practical engagement.\n\n“It cannot be just the government doing the work. The community must step up. We need locals and new immigrants to sit down, listen to one another and make an effort to integrate.”\n\nMr Dinesh draws on personal experience. His own extended family in the United Kingdom, once a tightly-knit South Indian cluster, has by the third generation transformed into a multicultural mix.\n\n“I’ve got Scottish and Greek nephews,” he said with a laugh. “But it took time. It didn’t happen in the first generation.”\n\nHe also pointed to success stories within Singapore: “The Sindhi community, for example, already has 75 per cent of their clan activities led by locals and 25 per cent by expats. That’s a model we can all learn from.”\n\nBeyond operational acumen, Mr Dinesh believes his deeper value lies in his understanding of minority concerns.\n\nHe is concerned about social mobility – ensuring no Singapore Indian is left behind. Of particular concern is that we are forgetting the bottom third of the local community who are struggling with education, drugs, alcohol and crime.\n\nHe wants a sharper focus on uplifting this group – particularly through education and mentorship. “We need more locally born success stories,” he said.\n\nMr Dinesh is clear about what he wants to do: bridge gaps, foster integration and build a stronger, more cohesive Indian community – so Singapore as a whole can thrive.\n\n“Because if we don’t rise together,” he said, “we’ll fall apart.”\n\nMr Dinesh’s decision to enter politics wasn’t taken lightly. In 2020, he had signed a contract to move into the private sector when he was asked to postpone it to join the Health Ministry in the thick of the pandemic.\n\nLater, it was then-Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong who personally approached him about politics.\n\n“I remember telling him: “I can help you as a civil servant – I don’t need to join politics,’” Mr Dinesh recounted.\n\nBut he was won over by PM Wong’s sincerity.\n\n“I had the opportunities I did because of Singapore. Now I want to make sure my children and their children have the same chances – and that no one gets left behind,” he said.\n\nThat’s the motivation that drives him.\n\nPM Wong has hinted that Mr Dinesh, along with former army chief David Neo, have the potential to grow into bigger leadership roles.\n\nBoth men, he noted, had demonstrated outstanding crisis leadership during the pandemic, with Mr Dinesh overseeing the complex nationwide vaccination campaign.\n\nBut Mr Dinesh is in no rush to speculate about a ministerial future.\n\n“There are grades to political appointments – Minister of State, Senior Minister of State – it’s a steep learning curve. It’s not about a title; it’s about whether you can operate under intense pressure and deliver outcomes.”\n\nMetallica fan who sings Tamil songs\n\nLong before Mr Dinesh Vasu Dash marched into Singapore’s political spotlight, he was a quiet boy growing up in a cramped police quarters at Pearl’s Hill, near Chinatown, sleeping beside his brother and grandmother in a room barely enough for three.\n\nYet, as he tells it: “We never felt like anything was lacking.”\n\nIt was a childhood filled with warmth, held together by a tight-knit family and the quiet heroism of his father Vasu Dash – a police officer for 34 years who once guarded President Devan Nair and Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n“He used to do 24-hour shifts and still made time for us,” Mr Dinesh recalled. “He set the standard for what service looks like – not just to the nation, but to your family.”\n\nThat example stayed with Mr Dinesh as the family moved from their one-room quarters to a three-room HDB flat in Telok Blangah Rise.\n\nMr Dinesh’s story is also deeply entwined with his Indian heritage.\n\nHe is a third-generation Singaporean with ancestral roots in Varkala, Kerala. His maternal family first settled in Malaysia before coming to Singapore, while his paternal grandfather ran a small business servicing the British naval base in Sembawang in the 1960s.\n\nThe family has long been part of Singapore’s working-class backbone – resilient, humble and driven by community. Some of his relatives migrated to the United Kingdom after the British pullout in 1971.\n\nMr Dinesh, who speaks fluent Malayalam and Tamil, spent a year in India on military training and describes it as rediscovering his roots.\n\nAn Anglo-Chinese School boy who studied electrical engineering at the National University of Singapore, his attraction to the military came early.\n\n“It was almost instinctive. Maybe it was from watching my dad in uniform,” he said. The military’s sense of structure and service spoke to him – and it became the foundation of his leadership.\n\nHis passion for sports reflects that same drive. The boy who once suffered from chronic asthma and had to go in and out of hospital, played hockey in school and ran tirelessly as a right-half – “It’s my karma to have to work hard,” he said.\n\nBut it was water polo that mirrored his spirit best. “It’s a sport where you can’t stop moving. You’re always treading water. That’s how I live – always in motion.”\n\nDespite a packed schedule, Mr Dinesh carves out time for his three children aged between 12 and 20 – two boys and a girl. Every morning, no matter how late his meetings end, he insists on sending them to school.\n\n“It’s my way of ensuring I’m present. Yesterday I got home at 1am, but I was up by 5.30am to drive them. It’s tiring, but it’s worth it.”\n\nHe was also present for his elder son’s graduation at Republic Polytechnic on May 5, less than 48 hours after the general election was over.\n\nWeekends, too, are sacred. He “curates” his time carefully, juggling constituency duties, family time and his ongoing volunteer work with Indian organisations.\n\nHis wife Dr Rathiga Velaithan, a cancer researcher in the public sector before she became a homemaker, wholeheartedly supports his political commitments.\n\nMr Dinesh starts his day with music and loves mee siam, wanton mee and prata with fish curry. “Simple, hearty, soul food,” he said beaming.\n\nHis music taste ranges from Tamil songs of the 80s to heavy metal music. In a recent video interview with Tamil Murasu he belted out a popular S.P. Balasubrahmanyam number Illaya Nila.\n\n“People know I like Metallica, but I also listen to Pearl Jam, Marilyn Manson, Alice in Chains…you name it,” he said.\n\nFor Mr Dinesh, heavy metal isn’t just noise – it’s a way to channel stress.\n\n“People ask me if I’m stressed. I say, stress is when someone’s shooting at you. Everything else is just work.”\n\nMr Dinesh Vasu Dash with his mother Sulochana Kurup.\n\nPhoto: Dinesh Vasu Dash\n\n“If the Indian community continues to fracture – between North and South Indians, locals and expats – we will not be able to punch above our weight in the future, as we have in the past.”\n\nMr Dinesh Vasu Dash", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/c49eb13bacc58dbfde46b42f4c03a3612e8853575f26f975da2803837a98b3bb?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Dinesh Vasu Dash and his wife Rathiga Velaithan during election campaigning."}]}

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the strengthened alliance would reduce trade barriers in a “new era for trade”.\n\nIndia to retain share of water it once sent outside the country\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that water that previously was being sent outside the country would now be retained for internal use, days after New Delhi suspended a water-sharing pact with Pakistan.\n\n“Earlier, water belonging to India was also going outside. Now India’s water will flow in its share... and be utilised for India itself,” Mr Modi said while speaking at an event in New Delhi.\n\nLast month, India suspended a 1960 water-sharing pact that ensured supply to 80 per cent of Pakistani farms following a terrorist attack in Indian Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\n\n15 extremists killed in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district\n\nMore than 15 Maoist rebels were killed in an encounter with security forces on Wednesday in the forests of Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district bordering Telangana where a massive counter-insurgency operation is underway, a senior police official said.\n\nThe gunfight broke out in the morning in Karregutta forest.\n\nOperation Sankalp, one of the biggest counter-insurgency actions launched in the Bastar region, involves around 24,000 security personnel.\n\nSamsung fights US$520 million tax demand, points to Reliance practice\n\nSamsung has asked an Indian tribunal to quash a US$520 million ($673 million) tax demand for allegedly misclassifying imports of networking gear, arguing officials were aware of the practice as India’s Reliance imported the same component similarly for years, Reuters reported.\n\nSamsung becomes the second major foreign company in recent months to challenge an Indian tax demand.\n\nVolkswagen has sued the Indian government in court for a record demand of US$1.4 billion for misclassifying its component imports.\n\nPanel to review copyright law amid legal challenges to OpenAI\n\nThe Indian government has set up a panel to review if existing copyright law is sufficient to tackle AI-related disputes, an official memo showed, at a time when OpenAI faces legal challenges stemming from accusations of exploiting copyrighted material.\n\nA case in the Delhi High Court by a group of top Indian news outlets and book publishers who say the firm uses their content without permission to help train its ChatGPT chatbot could reshape how the sector operates in India, reported Reuters.

Pant, vice-president of the Observer Research Foundation in India. “Whether the situation escalates depends on how Islamabad chooses to respond.”\n\nAcross the border, Dr Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, warned: “India has attacked Pakistan’s mainland. Pakistan will strike back with full force.”\n\nIn India, Operation Sindoor has been widely applauded, especially for its symbolism. The name refers to the red vermillion worn by married Hindu women – a nod to the 25 widows of the men killed in Pahalgam.\n\nThe press briefing on the operation, led by two women officers alongside Foreign Secretary Misri, has been lauded for its empowering optics.\n\nIn Pakistan, however, the mood is grim and defiant. Images of civilian casualties, including of the three-year-old girl, have triggered outrage.\n\nProfessor C. Raja Mohan of the National University of Singapore warns that global diplomacy will play a critical role in what happens next. “Do world powers act now to prevent Pakistan from retaliating, or only after it does?” he asked.\n\nBoth countries possess nuclear arsenals, making the stakes of miscalculation dangerously high.\n\nMilitary analysts say that any misstep – from a stray missile to an accidental incursion – could lead to a rapid escalation neither side wants but may be unable to avoid once begun.\n\nStill, past precedent offers some hope. After India’s 2016 “surgical strikes” and the 2019 Balakot bombing, both countries managed to back down.\n\nAFP, Reuters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/35e13299d74c204ee85eb2a673876b1c3dabc5a16a5757c98af9bafdfe2c1a9d?w=825", "alt_text": "A building in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, damaged by an Indian air strike on May 7."}]}

From my birth near the Straits of Johor, onto the Bay of Bengal and across to the Arabian Sea. And then to the Hudson River and the Thames in London. And now I have come back home, to the Kallang River,” Ms Ratii shared with the audience.\n\nMs Shantha was born in Singapore near the Straits of Johor. Her passion for movement ignited at a young age, starting with Bharatanatyam. At 14, she expanded her artistic horizons by taking up Kathakali, a male-dominated dance form, undeterred by gender norms. To deepen her craft, she moved to India and underwent a gurukulam (a traditional Indian education system where students, known as shishya, live and learn with a teacher, or guru) in Chennai, where she trained rigorously under the guidance of classical dance masters.\n\nMs Shantha’s path then took her across continents. She moved to New York to work as a producer for a cultural programme, where she helped bring South Asian arts to international audiences, after which she moved to London with her husband.\n\nFor this showcase, India’s rivers were spotlighted. Each group and solo act in the showcase symbolised each of them, with movements that captured their unique energy and spirit.\n\nUnder a soft blue hue that bathed the stage, dancers clad in traditional Indian and Malay costumes pranced to Carnatic music.\n\nThe pleats of traditional Bharatanatyam costumes flared open like lotus petals in bloom, while the straight lines of kebayas and baju melayus added to the visual feast. Red and amber, yellow and blue, their silken fabrics shimmered with every turn.\n\nOrganised by the Shantha Ratii Initiative (SRI) in honour of International Dance Day and in celebration of Singapore’s 60th anniversary, the show featured students from Shruthilaya Dance academy as well as Era Dance Theatre, a platform dedicated to nurturing young Malay performing arts talent.\n\nIt opened with a stunning introduction of all the dancers – both Indian and Malay dancing together – which was then followed by a joyful presentation of traditional Malay dance by the dancers of Era Dance Theatre.\n\nBetween performances, Ms Ratii addressed the audience, offering insight into the inspiration behind each piece. She spoke passionately about the symbolism of water as a life-giving force.\n\n“Rivers have always been a source of comfort, peace and inspiration for me,” she said.\n\nAmidst the intensity of the choreography, the dancers moved with such passion and precision that a few earrings came loose.\n\nYet, with remarkable focus and grace, they danced around the fallen jewellery without missing a beat – masterfully avoiding the sharp glint of metal as though it were part of the choreography itself.\n\nMs Ratii’s vision was clear – to evoke the spirit of India’s great rivers, whose banks have cradled civilisations for millennia, interwoven with stories of Hindu deities told through classical Indian dance. Her movements on stage were amplified by the striking costume changes that mirrored the arc of the performance. She began in a white, swan-like ensemble,  flowy and ethereal, with delicate chiffon detailing that caught the light as she glided across the stage like a river in motion.\n\nLater, she re-appeared in a regal green and deep red costume, adorned with layers of heavy gold jewellery.\n\nThe final performance of the evening, symbolising the river Yamuna, featured Ms Ratii dancing alongside students from her mentorship programme, which is an initiative she created to nurture the next generation of dancers.\n\n“The programme picks promising young dancers and guides them through their dance journey,” she explained, adding that this endeavour is particularly close to her heart.\n\n“Artists and their cultural expression manifest the spirit of a nation,” she said.\n\nWith every movement, Kallang to Kaveri transported its audience beyond borders.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/76ceeaec9fbdad6ce25de649f676fd2f4cbb038a17189c02478af510fb78a8dc?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Shantha Ratii in Kallang to Kaveri in a piece on Yamuna and traditional Malay dance representing Kallang river."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f3b2b3a494daad698fa53974e2f329b26d429f18181c6565ef9a79444c8f1772?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Shantha Ratii in Kallang to Kaveri in a piece on Yamuna and traditional Malay dance representing Kallang river."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/76ceeaec9fbdad6ce25de649f676fd2f4cbb038a17189c02478af510fb78a8dc?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Shantha Ratii in Kallang to Kaveri in a piece on Yamuna and traditional Malay dance representing Kallang river."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f3b2b3a494daad698fa53974e2f329b26d429f18181c6565ef9a79444c8f1772?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Shantha Ratii in Kallang to Kaveri in a piece on Yamuna and traditional Malay dance representing Kallang river."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/76ceeaec9fbdad6ce25de649f676fd2f4cbb038a17189c02478af510fb78a8dc?w=825", "alt_text": "Ms Shantha Ratii in Kallang to Kaveri in a piece on Yamuna and traditional Malay dance representing Kallang river."}]}

I’m glad the Singaporean Indian community used the moment to highlight that, for them, this offhand racism is not new.\n\nMost of all, I’m glad the jaw-dropping comment got Singaporeans – particularly those from the majority community – talking.\n\nSingaporeans must care enough to have difficult conversations about race. Such racist attitudes should not – and cannot – be seen as a problem for the minority alone.\n\nSuch attitudes are a Singaporean problem. Every racist episode, gone unaddressed, is another dent to our very identity as a multiracial society.\n\nThe colour of our skin\n\nDr Wong’s comment affected me, very personally.\n\nBecause my family members are not all the same colour, I have had to answer questions from curious aunties when out and about with my children.\n\n“This one, your son?” and “You marry Indian man, ah?”\n\nMy husband has had to do the same. “The mother must be very fair,” someone once stopped him to remark.\n\nHeavily pregnant in 2019, I thought I had heard it all, from “Wah, your stomach very big” to “Twins, ah? Your husband, power”. What I did not expect: “I wonder what colour the babies will be.”\n\nYou see, my husband is Indian, and has a lot more melanin than I do.\n\nI remember thinking: “Please, God, I don’t care what colour the babies are. Just make them the same colour as each other.”\n\nI recall that moment clearly.\n\nIt felt like a gut-punch and opened my eyes to the reality of the Singapore that my husband, a dark-skinned man, has to navigate.\n\nA Singapore in which people are still put into boxes based on the colour of their skin, no matter their contributions or qualifications.\n\nI do not want my sons to have to face the same.\n\nNo one is colour-blind, and we shouldn’t try to teach our children to be so. That will set them up for failure.\n\nWhat we should teach our children is that people come in all shapes, sizes and colours, and the colour of their skin is just that – a colour.\n\nWhen I was in primary school and taking the school bus home, my friends would point to my mother. “Vanessa, your maid is waiting for you,” they used to say.\n\nI was too confused, embarrassed and hurt to correct them.\n\nMy mother is Indian-Chinese, and I am Eurasian. And we are not the same colour.\n\nNow, I am teaching my children that our skin colour is determined by how much melanin we have, and that the colour of one’s skin does not tell us much about a person.\n\nWhat are their passions? Who do they love? What talents can they contribute to society?\n\nOr, as I say to my boys, you can’t tell a person’s favourite colour, fruit or superhero from the colour of their skin. People are more than what’s on the outside.\n\nA few months ago, my husband and one of our sons were walking out of a public library, hand in hand. An older Chinese man tried to stop them, gesticulating wildly and threatening to call the police.\n\nIt turned out that the man thought my husband was kidnapping our son, because – you guessed it – they are not the same colour.\n\nI hope that parents of my generation will give their children the words to describe people beyond the colour of their skin. “That boy with the red shirt”, for example, or “the girl on the swing”.\n\nWith inter-ethnic marriages on the rise, I’m sure more families will have the same experiences mine has had.\n\nSo, when moments like Dr Wong’s comments happen again – and they will – the answer is not to look the other way.\n\nThe answer is not to claim ignorance, or say “I didn’t know”.\n\nThe answer is to talk about it. Like the Gigene Wong episode, I hope a wider discussion can be had about the hard truths of race in Singapore.\n\nLet’s talk about it. Doing so will strengthen our multiracial society. We can do better. For our children, we must.\n\nWhat we should teach our children is that people come in all shapes, sizes and colours, and the colour of their skin is just that – a colour.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e46ea5bcbe522c51ea3bd843ae6b8471802d469397e5160943b29032c9d4342b?w=825", "alt_text": "The writer’s newborn twins in 2020.

Kavi\n\nSakti Singaravelu\n\nNestled in the chilled fruit juices section at selected Sheng Siong supermarkets in Singapore is a South Indian alcoholic drink staging a quiet comeback after decades in obscurity.\n\nThat drink is toddy, a type of coconut palm wine which, at Sheng Siong, is marketed under the name HighDrate – a combination of “high” and “hydrate” to signify the drink’s alcoholic and hydrating properties.\n\nNaturally fizzy from fermentation, toddy has a mildly sweet and tangy flavour.\n\nThe man behind the revival of toddy is Mr Sharaveen Prasath, 32, who used to run a home-based satti soru or Indian clay pot rice business during the covid pandemic.\n\nIn Malaysia, where he has relatives, satti soru is typically served with toddy, and he wanted to do the same in Singapore as he knew there was a demand here.\n\nSo he and his long-time girlfriend, Ms Hemapriya, 32, started HighDrate.\n\nToddy, or kallu in Tamil, usually has a shelf life of around 45 days but the company has developed a unique processing technique that extends it to a year, making the drink viable for retail.\n\nHighDrate’s version of toddy has a 2.2 percent alcohol content and was launched on April 13 this year with an initial batch of 250 bottles distributed across 20 Sheng Siong supermarkets.\n\nAmong them are the outlets at Junction Nine shopping mall in Yishun and at Block 506 in Tampines Central.\n\nEach 500ml bottle of HighDrate at Sheng Siong retails for $12.40 – a marked difference from the modest price once paid when toddy was sold exclusively at government-run shops in Singapore until 1979.\n\nUntil then, toddy was harvested here by a government-licensed contractor but it ended in 1979 when he ceased operations due to rising labour costs.\n\nToddy was still available in Singapore after that but in limited supply.\n\nIn 2022, Mr Sharaveen received his permit from the Singapore Food Agency to import toddy.\n\nHighDrate sources its toddy from two coconut plantations in Melaka.\n\nThe first shipment in early 2022 consisted of about 200 bottles of toddy with each 1.2 litre bottle priced at $35.\n\nThese bottles are sold wholesale or through the company’s online store and differ from the newer retail version that is available at Sheng Siong.\n\nHighDrate has since cut costs through economies of scale and expanded its operations team. It now stocks between 4,000 and 6,000 bottles each month with weekly shipments, bringing the price per bottle down to $21.\n\nThe company has also expanded its client base. “We started with Indian minimarts, then Indian restaurants and now some hotels carry our product,” Mr Sharaveen said.\n\nIt is also available in upscale bars like those in lifestyle hotel Artyzen Singapore, which incorporate HighDrate’s toddy into cocktails.\n\nMr Sharaveen’s path to becoming a toddy entrepreneur was far from conventional.\n\nHe studied sports management at the Institute of Technical Education, pursued a diploma in mass communications and worked as an instructor for an outdoor adventure programme company.\n\nHe was not academically inclined as a child and felt directionless during his youth.\n\n“I had good friends but none of us had any foresight. We used to skip classes, hang around outside and drink.”\n\nA public fallout with his boss became the turning point that pushed him to become his own boss. To do so, he realised he needed to be disciplined.\n\n“Motivation is just an illusion. You won’t have it every single day but you need to have discipline every single day,” Mr Sharaveen said.\n\nTo cultivate discipline, he used to routinely wake up at 5am and go for a run.\n\n“The runs were not to keep fit but to force myself to do something that I didn’t want to do. Once I had accomplished that, the rest of the day would feel like a breeze,” he said.\n\nWhile Mr Sharaveen oversees the operations at HighDrate, Ms Hemapriya handles the business side – managing the company’s finances, accounts and logistics at their office in Ubi Techpark.\n\nShe also works at a logistics and warehousing company.\n\nThe two have been together since secondary school and their personal relationship is a key factor behind HighDrate’s success.\n\nIt took the company almost two years to secure the permit to import and sell toddy but the couple were determined to see it through.\n\n“We did face a lot of issues along the way but our end goal is to be together and to do something that keeps us together. This is something we started together and we did not want it to end,” Ms Hemapriya said.\n\nThe couple plans to export their toddy overseas, experiment with flavoured toddy and broaden the company’s range of coconut-based products.\n\n“The vision for HighDrate is to be the leading supplier of toddy in South-East Asia. We want to have a hub where we buy toddy, support local farmers and supply it all over the world,” Mr Sharaveen said.\n\n“Every part of the coconut tree is usable. From the leaves to the husk to the spadix (flower stalk) so we would like to do more things using the coconut tree.”\n\nA bottle of HighDrate’s toddy in Sheng Siong supermarkets.\n\nPhoto: Sharaveen Prasath\n\nBottles of HighDrate’s toddy in the chilled fruit juices section.\n\nPhoto: Sakti Singaravelu\n\nMr Sharaveen Prasath holding the spadix (flower stalk) of the coconut tree.\n\nPhoto: T.

I could climb them easily.\n\n“But here in Malaysia, it rains often. The trees get slippery, so I have to use a ladder.”\n\nMr Kumar’s day begins at 5am.\n\nHe tightens his tool belt, sharpens his sickle with a few quick strokes, grabs his ladder and heads into the plantation.\n\nThe smell of fermenting toddy fills the humid air as he sets up and begins his climb.\n\nAs soon as he reaches the top, he knows exactly which flower stalk to choose.\n\nHe starts working on it, massaging and gently twisting the stalk to soften the tissue inside and stimulate the sap flow.\n\nThis goes on every day for two weeks.\n\nHe then ties a raffia string around the flower stalk to keep its shape and prevent it from blooming into flowers.\n\nAfter a few days, he slices the tip to check for sap. That is when he knows if he’s ready to make a clean cut.\n\nAs the sap begins to drip, he ties a pot below to collect the toddy.\n\n“There aren’t many toddy tappers left these days. The tradition is slowly fading,” said Mr Sharaveen.\n\n“I’m looking at introducing modern technology like a pump system, to make the process more efficient.

Authorities refused to let Ms Saira take him.\n\n“We shall meet soon,” Mr Farhan had told her moments before. But within minutes, the family was cleaved apart.\n\nMs Saira fainted while crossing, overwhelmed by grief. Officials later allowed a brief reunion – a small gesture in the face of colossal emotional devastation.\n\nLike Ms Saira and Mr Farhan, hundreds of cross-border families are grappling with the consequences of a political decision made thousands of kilometres from their homes.\n\nIn some cases, the division has already proved fatal. An 80-year-old Pakistani man visiting relatives in Jammu and Kashmir on the Indian side died of a heart attack en route to the border. His body was sent back – but was refused entry by Pakistani authorities.\n\nThe border crackdown has unearthed stories of resilience and heartbreak.\n\nMs Haleema Begum, who moved from Karachi to Odisha 25 years ago, was asked to leave despite raising two Indian-born sons after her husband’s death, reported Al Jazeera. Her sons pleaded to accompany her, but with Indian passports, they were denied.\n\nShe now faces a journey back to a homeland where she has no house or family.\n\n“They’re all victims of love,” said Ms Ayesha Begum, watching her daughter-in-law Saira weep. “Fall in love in hell, but never in Pakistan,” she muttered bitterly.\n\nFor the Takhat Singh family, what was meant to be a joyful wedding week turned tragic, reported the BBC.\n\nVisiting Rajasthan from Sindh Province for their daughter’s wedding, the family was split when authorities barred Mr Singh’s Indian wife Sindhu Kanwar from returning to Pakistan with the rest.\n\n“How can you separate us like this?” he asked. His younger daughter wept at the border: “How would you feel if you had to live without your mother?”\n\nMs Sultana Parveen, who has lived in India for 41 years, had no family left in Pakistan. Still, she was forced to return. “I am completely helpless,” she said.\n\nMore than 1,750 citizens from both sides have been forced to return home in the past week. Visas have been torn apart; long-term residency offers revoked. The Attari-Wagah border is closed for all but a handful.\n\nAs dusk descended on Attari, Ms Saira clutched her baby one last time. Around them, guards, cameras, and crying children populated the checkpoint. Mr Farhan’s sister Nooreen sighed: “Only a mother knows the pain of leaving behind a nine-month-old.”\n\n“Even a bird hesitates before leaving its nest. We left everything behind. What will we go back to?”\n\nMr Hanuman Prasad, who came from Pakistan a decade ago and now holds Indian citizenship", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/87e1e7d1fbbf53d68128b8f56b5f90ceacbf4d0efc08fed99610851e5eec5569?w=825", "alt_text": "A man pleads with Border Security Force personnel to allow his child to go along with his wife to Pakistan at the Attari-Wagah border."}]}

Agrawal, stars Fawad opposite Indian actress Vaani Kapoor.\n\nThe story is a romantic tale of healing and connection, supported by a stellar cast including Soni Razdan, Lisa Haydon, Ridhi Dogra and Farida Jalal.\n\nThe Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) – the industry’s powerful workers’ union – took a strong stance against the film, issuing a renewed directive of “complete non-cooperation” with Pakistani talent.\n\n“The attack in Pahalgam compels us to once again reinforce our boycott of Pakistani artistes. National interest must come first,” read its statement.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Fawad’s social media post condemning the Pahalgam attack failed to sway public or political opinion. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims,” he had written.\n\nVaani also expressed her sorrow: “Gutted. Devastated.”\n\nIn a retaliatory move, Pakistani authorities have also banned the film, citing the involvement of Indian actress Vaani, reported Siasat.com.\n\nSenior Pakistani distributor Satish Anand confirmed: “Abir Gulaal will not be released here either. The climate isn’t right, and Vaani Kapoor’s role only complicates matters.”\n\nWith both countries banning the film, the makers now face substantial financial loss. Industry insiders say the movie’s future hangs in the balance.\n\n“It’s a tragic irony,” said a film trade analyst. “A movie meant to celebrate love and unity is now symbolic of division.”\n\nThe film’s ban comes amid a wave of punitive measures from India in response to the Pahalgam massacre.\n\nThese include suspending the Indus Water Treaty, freezing visa arrangements and tightening borders.\n\nThe CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) also reportedly declined to clear the film, calling it “amateurish” and “confusing”, citing concerns that it “encourages public revolt”.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Fawad’s films have faced hurdles.\n\nHis 2022 Pakistani blockbuster The Legend of Maula Jatt also failed to get an Indian release due to objections from right-wing groups.\n\nLikewise, Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil faced threats from political outfits during its release.\n\nThe row has reignited the debate over whether Pakistani artists should be allowed to work in India.\n\nVeteran writer and lyricist Javed Akhtar weighed in with a nuanced take.\n\nSpeaking to the Press Trust of India, he remarked: “There are two sides to this. It’s true that we’ve always welcomed Pakistani artistes warmly but it’s never been reciprocated. Why did Lata Mangeshkar never perform in Pakistan despite being beloved there? The blockade seems systemic.”\n\nAkhtar added: “By banning Pakistani artists, we’re pleasing the extremists – both there and here. But given the situation right now, I would say no (to allowing them to work in India).”\n\nFawad’s re-entry into Indian cinema was already viewed as a litmus test for how the industry might embrace cross-border artistic exchange again.\n\nNow, Abir Gulaal seems destined to be remembered not for its art, but for the political turbulence that engulfed it.\n\n“It’s a tragic irony.

The cause of death remains undetermined.\n\n“We are deeply saddened to be informed of the death of Ms Vanshika, a student from India in Ottawa. The matter has been taken up with concerned authorities and the cause is under investigation as per local police,” the High Commission said in a statement on X.\n\nMs Vanshika hailed from Dera Bassi in Punjab and moved to Canada two and a half years ago to pursue a diploma course, reported NDTV.

It was a celebration of history, culture, and the enduring bond between Singapore’s Indian community and Little India.\n\nThe evening kicked off with a traditional Indian dance performance, setting the stage for a celebration of Singapore’s Indian heritage. The guest of honour was Mr George Yeo, Singapore’s former minister for foreign affairs, who addressed the crowd of over 100 people.\n\n“What is Singapore? Singapore has no meaning in itself. Its meaning (lies) only in relation to the network in which we live,” said Mr Yeo.\n\n“Singapore is so tiny. It may be small, but it is finely sketched. It has many circuits, many details and one of those details is Little India.”\n\nIn her book, which she actively began to work on in June 2023, Mrs Soundara delved deep into the evolution of Little India, the heart of the Indian community in Singapore.\n\nThe neighbourhood, often seen as a microcosm of the community, has long been a focal point for cultural exchange, commerce and community spirit.\n\nShe traced Little India’s transformation from humble beginnings to a bustling district, rich in history and brimming with life. From early Indian settlers to the current vibrant hub, Little India stands as a testament to the contributions of the Indian community to the Singaporean fabric.\n\n“It (Little India) offers Indians a strong sense of ethnic attachment and it has become an indispensable part of the lives of Singapore Indians,” she said in the book’s foreword.\n\nThe president of the Little India Shopkeepers & Heritage Association Abdul Rao called the book “a bridge between generations,” and a vital effort to protect the community’s legacy.\n\nMrs Soundara’s mission is to preserve Little India’s history for future generations.\n\n“This year marks the 60th anniversary of Singapore’s independence and I felt it was the perfect moment to document the story of Little India,” she said, adding that this book is her small contribution to the nation’s rich tapestry.\n\n“Whatever I have heard, whatever I have read about Little India, I put in my maximum efforts to record in this book.”\n\nMrs Soundara Nayaki Vairavan’s latest book.\n\nPhoto: Mrs Soundara Nayaki Vairavan\n\nThis year, 2025, marks the 60th anniversary of Singapore’s independence, and I felt it was the perfect moment to document the story of Little India.\n\nMrs Soundara Nayaki Vairavan, author of Little India and the Singapore Indian Community: Through the Ages", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5a112e11cd7d404bf68495ce9ea8be5ba71e11c3a44d92e665a295c2895095b6?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr George Yeo, Dr Shilpak Ambule, High Commissioner of India to Singapore, and Mrs Soundara."}]}

In total, we sold 620 tickets,” said temple chairman Dr Indrayogan Yogarajah.\n\nBesides the documentary titled A Sacred Space in Singapore, there was also a poster exhibition Roots and Routes: The Ceylon Tamils of Singapore.\n\nThe temple, a heritage site, has served as a meeting place for the Ceylon Tamil community since their arrival in Singapore in the 1840s.\n\nSaid Mr Asoka: “For me, the attachment to the temple came from attending Sunday religious classes as a kid.”\n\nThe one-hour documentary featured interviews with senior members of the community who reflected on the early days and the shared efforts that led to the building of the temple.\n\nIt showcased the temple’s Chola-style architecture and the vibrant spirit of the devotees.\n\nMrs Vasantha Yoganathan, 70, said the documentary evoked cherished memories of her childhood spent at the temple.\n\n“It was well-produced and truly captured the communal spirit we had back in those days,” she said.\n\nThe poster exhibition traced the history and significance of the Ceylon Tamil community in Singapore from its early settlers to prominent leaders who helped in nation building.\n\nOne of those listed was President Tharman, whose father and grandfather were actively involved in the SCTA, Ceylon Sports Club and the temple, said Dr Indrayogan.\n\nPresident Tharman attended the documentary screening followed by a tea reception and toured the poster exhibition.\n\nAdded Dr Indrayogan: “Being a Ceylon Tamil and being a president of the country, we are happy that he’s able to come and be present with us.”\n\nAnother prominent figure from the Ceylon Tamil community was the late Mr S. Rajaratnam, Singapore’s first foreign minister who also penned the National Pledge. The documentary featured archival footage of him attending the temple’s consecration ceremony in 1970.\n\nResidents from the Sree Narayana Mission nursing home and members of Project Dreamcatchers, which supports youth with chronic illnesses, also attended the event.\n\n“Community outreach programmes are intrinsic to what we do,” said Mr Asoka.\n\nDurgashini Loganathan Pilai", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e455fb836d08913cf818575978b887c7194165c3c643bd3e9014a6788973daf8?w=825", "alt_text": "President Tharman Shanmugaratnam with one of the organisers, Mrs Indra Iswaran."}]}

Everyone uses a smartphone, so an app is a good solution.”\n\nThe Majulah app provides a real time view on what is happening at each polling station in terms of logistics. Thanks to it, now only around 20 staff are needed at the call centre.\n\nAnother green aspect that ST Logistics is implementing are eco-cages.\n\nThese lightweight and recyclable structures will be used to store and transport essential items to the polling stations.\n\nThe eco-cages have rollers and are therefore easy to move around.

Santosh Kumar\n\nBorn in Kuala Lumpur and raised in the vibrant, multicultural hub of Singapore, Cheryl Bains (right) always knew music would define her life.\n\nNow, at just 25, she is redefining the classical music scene in India – a country better known for its Bollywood beats than its operatic arias.\n\nCheryl’s journey is a compelling story of passion, discipline and innovation, culminating in her original crossover opera, The Legend of the Goddess, which premiered this March at Mumbai’s iconic Royal Opera House.\n\nHer artistic roots run deep. She began her musical education at the age of five, training in Hindustani classical music under her mother’s guidance in Singapore.\n\n“My mum (Madam Manjula Bains, who is now her manager) saw my passion and made sure I started early,” Cheryl recalls.\n\nHer father, Captain Gurwinder Singh Bains, a Singapore Airlines pilot, supported her pursuit of music, even as the family relocated briefly to India during the 2009 global recession.\n\nThat move turned out to be pivotal.\n\nIn Delhi, a young Cheryl joined the Austrian Cultural Forum’s Mozart Children’s Choir of India. It was during a performance of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater that she experienced a moment of clarity: opera was her true calling. “It felt like finding a secret garden meant only for me,” she says.\n\nReturning to Singapore, Cheryl trained rigorously, singing with the Singapore Symphony Children’s Choir and the Singapore Lyric Opera Children’s Choir, absorbing influences from Western and Chinese classical traditions.\n\nAt 17, she moved to New York to study at the Manhattan School of Music, where she excelled in roles like Gretel (Hansel and Gretel) and Maria (The Sound of Music), and even premiered her cross-cultural arrangements of Indian classics like Vande Mataram for Western audiences.\n\nDespite her thriving United States career – aided by a prestigious artiste visa and mentorship from acclaimed jazz arranger Ladd McIntosh – Cheryl felt a pull towards India.\n\n“I never thought I’d start my professional journey there,” she says, “but India welcomed me in a way I didn’t expect.”\n\nOpera in India is still a niche, but Cheryl’s arrival is changing that. She is making a mark along with the likes of Sparsh Bajpai, Kabuki Khanna and Pallavi Seth.\n\nIn a country where classical Western music isn’t mainstream, she has found a way to bridge cultures, weaving her Indian roots and operatic training into something truly unique.\n\nHer magnum opus, The Legend of the Goddess, is a bold reimagining of Vedic mythology through the lens of Western opera.\n\nInspired by spiritual leader and bestselling author Om Swami’s book of the same name, Cheryl composed and performed the show entirely in English to reach a global audience.\n\nThe production, presented by the Royal Opera House Mumbai, was a success.\n\n“The show was like a deep-dive into the mythic and cultural richness of India… almost like being sucked in by a vortex of energy and exhilaration,” said Mumbai-based national award filmmaker and author Brahmanand S. Siingh. “Cheryl’s interpretation and expression of the Devi culture mixed with her operatic singing and performance prowess kept us in thrall, like a thriller.”\n\nCheryl managed the mammoth task of writing, composing, directing and performing – even overseeing marketing and production logistics alongside her mother, who she calls her “real-life goddess of empowerment”.\n\n“The voice is a delicate instrument,” Cheryl says, “and the same is true for the soul. Keeping both nourished and disciplined is key, especially when you’re breaking new ground.”\n\nThis October, Cheryl will bring The Legend of the Goddess to Singapore, the city where her dreams took root.\n\nSupported by Musicians’ Initiative, this homecoming performance marks a full-circle moment. “Singapore gave me my wings,” she says. “Now I get to fly back with a creation that’s entirely my own.”\n\nMusicians’ Initiative music director Alvin Arumugam, who will be the conductor, said: “Cheryl has a unique voice both as a soprano and an artiste. Besides her impeccable control of the voice, she uses her artistry to reach out to her audience through powerful and meaningful narrative projects. Our upcoming work together is groundbreaking as we have never had an operatic telling of the subject presented in The Legend of Goddess in Singapore.”\n\nPerforming at home will also reunite Cheryl with an audience that has watched her evolve from a gifted child into an internationally-recognised artiste. “Singapore taught me to appreciate diversity, to find beauty in different traditions,” she reflects. “My musical language is richer because of it.”\n\nCheryl likes to position herself as a singer-composer.\n\n“Whatever I sing, or write, is always influenced by my cultural heritage,” she says. “Because I spend a lot of time in Singapore, I’m pretty well versed in western classical Chinese music. This gave me access to different harmonic soundscapes and colour palettes. Whenever I write music related to South-east Asia, I use the sounds that I have heard of traditional Chinese instruments.”\n\nKhor Ai Ming, a Singaporean contemporary-classical soprano and Compass artistic excellence award recipient who is artistic director at Vocal Associates, said: “Cheryl brings something rare and beautiful to her art. She doesn’t sing just for recognition; she uses her voice to share her spirit and soul with the world.\n\n“Watching her grow and express herself so authentically fills me with pride. I feel honoured to be her teacher and can’t wait to see the beautiful music and performances she has yet to create.”", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/afbf96942845bf28d12ccc5944e989477637c4806729716cc185623dc0789638?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

They always find some obscure clause to harass small business owners.”\n\nThe film challenges India’s income tax structure, GST, excise duties, customs levies, property and professional taxes – and questions why, despite so many revenue streams, the country still turns to the World Bank for loans.\n\n“Shouldn’t a better, more transparent system reduce corruption and inflation?” he asks.\n\nBut Mr Shetye’s foray into filmmaking has hit a roadblock. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) refused to clear Tax Free India, citing the film’s screenplay as “too amateurish” and accusing it of “confusing tax policies and encouraging public revolt”.\n\nUndeterred, Mr Shetye now plans to bypass theatrical release altogether. The film will be uploaded on YouTube, where the censor board holds no sway.\n\n“By the first week of May, the film will be online for all to see,” he affirms.\n\nDespite the CBFC’s objections, Mr Shetye has found support among members of the business community.\n\nA Navi Mumbai developer, who previewed the film, told The Times of India: “Tax Free India highlights how the middle class and entrepreneurs are crushed under taxes while public money is misused for appeasement or unnecessary infrastructure projects. If the government isn’t afraid of scrutiny, why not allow this film to be shown?”\n\nThe film may not win awards for cinematic brilliance, but it offers a unique grassroots perspective on India’s fiscal ecosystem – one rooted in frustration, satire and a desperate desire for change.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/57c4ec764a0020afacbfa7bd467c7dab17c49868408898cdbc4cb50427c01ce9?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

When she asked me to drive her on a shopping errand, she made it tough for me to follow my fine principles.\n\nOn one such occasion, I asked her if she’d be done in half an hour.\n\nShe said she couldn’t estimate the time accurately and that I should go for a one-hour timing on the coupon, to be safe.\n\nI explained that it was more important to maximise the cents than to be safe, but she stuck to her estimate; so I reluctantly complied.\n\nShe browsed around for five minutes in the shop then shook her head and asked me to take her to Kallang. “Keep looking.” I said, consulting my watch.\n\n“You have another 53 minutes.”\n\n“I don’t need 53 minutes – take me to Kallang now.”\n\n“What you need doesn’t matter. I’ve punched the holes, so please shop here for a while. I don’t mind losing the last 10 minutes,” I added magnanimously.\n\nInstead of listening to the cool voice of reason, she simply walked to the car. I reluctantly joined her but did not start the engine.\n\n“Why don’t we sit and chat for, say, 47 minutes?” I suggested, looking at my watch.\n\nShe refused, even though, only on the previous night when I was watching the French Open, she had complained that we don’t talk enough.\n\nI drove, with controlled aggression, to reach the Kallang car park quickly, hoping to recoup value from the coupons on my dashboard.\n\nBut that car park had been changed to an automated system which, with ruthless efficiency, deducts the exact parking fee when you leave.\n\nForty-seven minutes of paid parking was squandered. It was painful for a man of my high ethos.\n\nSo, when the parking app was introduced a few years ago, the sun began shining once again in public parking spaces for me.\n\nNo longer did I have to spend minutes to estimate parking minutes. I could simply start with the half-hour estimate and coolly keep extending the time, waiting till the last few seconds to ensure not a cent is wasted.\n\nBut even that is not necessary – I can “end parking” at my will without being charged for the overestimated time.\n\nThis app of honour and integrity has made parking almost fun.\n\nI no longer have to drive my wife for a shopping jaunt in a state of anxiety and get into arguments about her powers of estimation at each car park.\n\nThere is one problem though.\n\nI often forget to “end parking” when I’m done. And nothing is as frustrating as finding out that I’ve squandered 22 minutes of legitimate paid parking simply because I forgot to touch a button.\n\nTherefore, if any of the geniuses who designed the app is reading this, I humbly request them to introduce an app upgrade.\n\nAt the end of my parking session, when I start my car to leave, the app should immediately let out a scream, the volume in direct proportion to the minutes of paid parking left.\n\nAnd if the whiz kids could whiz some more, the app should also freeze the car’s brakes and release it only when I click on “end parking”.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/146075b0b17522d33412dfcdec402f638a57d92c1b96a2188206274a890ed39f?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nIn the swirling chaos of modern cricket, where fierce speed and big-hitting dominate, a new sensation has emerged – and he’s just 14.\n\nVaibhav Suryavanshi, the precociously gifted left-hander from Bihar, announced himself to the world with a blistering century for Rajasthan Royals (RR) against Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on April 28 – becoming the youngest centurion in men’s T20 history.\n\nIn doing so, he has drawn inevitable, and thrilling, comparisons to a young Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nVaibhav’s record-breaking 101 off just 38 balls – featuring 11 towering sixes and seven fours – wasn’t merely a statistical marvel; it was a breathtaking glimpse into the future of Indian cricket.\n\nWatching him dismantle an international-grade bowling attack with composure and flair evoked memories of Sachin’s fearless arrival in the late 1980s.\n\nWhat makes Vaibhav extraordinary is not just his numbers, but his method.\n\nHis high, circular bat swing, generating astonishing power and timing, recalls the elegance of Brian Lara and the sheer audacity of Yuvraj Singh. But at just 14, Vaibhav seems to wield a bat with the mind of a seasoned professional.\n\n“He’s got a great downswing,” RR’s batting coach Vikram Rathour explained. “That helps him generate power most 20-year-olds can only dream of. Technically sound, mentally fearless – that’s why he’s special.”\n\nRathour added that Vaibhav regularly takes on England’s Jofra Archer in the nets – the fastest and most intimidating bowler at the Royals – and wins those mini-battles with effortless confidence. “He doesn’t think about reputation. He just plays the ball,” Rathour said.\n\nIndeed, in the historic knock against GT, Vaibhav nonchalantly smashed Afghanistan spin whiz Rashid Khan – one of the world’s best bowlers – to complete his hundred, swatting aside the pressure that would buckle even seasoned players.\n\nVaibhav’s journey has been the stuff of modern cricket fairytales. Born in 2011 in Tajpur, Bihar, he started playing cricket at the age of four under the watchful eyes of his father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, a farmer and part-time journalist.\n\nBy 12, Vaibhav had already made a mark in India’s domestic Ranji Trophy scene. At 13, RR fought off heavy competition to sign him for Rs1.10 crore ($169,000) at the 2024 IPL auction – making him the youngest player ever picked.\n\nIt wasn’t just blind investment. Scouts and coaches were stunned by his bat speed, sharp cricketing intelligence, and maturity beyond his years.\n\nFormer India legend Rahul Dravid, now RR coach, described him as “a player with unbelievable poise and natural instinct”.\n\nThe result? A record-breaking 58-ball century against Australia Under-19s, two half-centuries in the Under-19 Asia Cup, and now, history in the world’s most glamorous cricket league.\n\nAfter his century on Monday, Vaibhav’s words reflected a clarity rarely seen in teenagers.\n\n“It feels really good. It’s like a dream to score a century in the IPL,” he said. “I don’t think about fear or pressure. I just focus on the ball.”\n\nHis calmness is eerie. At an age where peer pressure and nerves are common, Vaibhav’s mind seems wired differently.\n\nHe credits his success to simple, intense practice – “what I have been practising for three-four months, the result is showing,” he said.\n\nBatting alongside India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav found an ideal mentor in the middle. “Jaiswal bhaiya keeps it positive. It makes batting easy,” he said.\n\nNaturally, whispers of “the next Sachin” have begun. And there are striking parallels.\n\nJust as Sachin stunned the cricketing world by hammering Abdul Qadir for 27 runs in an over as a 16-year-old, Vaibhav toyed with world-class bowlers like Rashid, Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj.\n\nBoth have shown an intuitive understanding of the game at a ridiculously young age. Both possess an unteachable mix of talent, hunger and fearlessness.\n\nFormer India batsman Suresh Raina summed it up best: “Vaibhav will rule cricket in the future. He’s not just talent; he’s destiny.”\n\nThe RR management, famous for nurturing young talent like Sanju Samson, Yashasvi and Dhruv Jurel, have already begun carefully managing Vaibhav’s trajectory.\n\n“We knew he was extraordinary from day one,” RR captain Riyan Parag said. “But seeing him explode like this against top-class bowlers, it’s almost surreal. We’ll make sure he stays grounded and keeps growing.”\n\nEven Dravid, recovering from an injury, reportedly jumped off his wheelchair in excitement during Vaibhav’s stunning innings – a sight that says more about the boy’s impact than any statistic.\n\nThe path ahead for Vaibhav is filled with promise – and pressure. Cricket history is littered with young prodigies who couldn’t bear the weight of expectation.\n\nBut, if his serene temperament, dazzling talent and humble attitude are anything to go by, India could be witnessing the rise of a generational superstar.\n\nAlready, international scouts and cricket boards are watching closely. Already, IPL fans have a new poster boy. And already, bowlers around the world are wondering – how do you bowl to a 14-year-old who seems born to destroy you?", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7a5d1cc60dd4f83e2c4ef7c4ecd92f68b9b37b795d05be5686ae2c849db23ccb?w=825", "alt_text": "Rajasthan Royals’ Vaibhav Suryavanshi celebrates after becoming the youngest player to score an IPL century."}]}

With few diversions, illicit liquor and gambling ruled daily life. Fights and domestic disputes were routine, and the community’s future looked bleak.\n\nThat was until a local tea shop owner, Charaliyil Unnikrishnan, decided to make a bold move – introducing chess to his customers.\n\nWhat began as an eccentric experiment soon became a social movement. Chess replaced the bottle. Curiosity turned to obsession. Villagers who once passed time in smoky dens began crowding under palm trees and awnings to outthink each other over the board.\n\nNow, Marottichal has rebranded itself entirely. Of its 6,000 residents, over 4,500 – farmers, shopkeepers, homemakers, children – are proficient in chess, reported The Indian Express.\n\nTea shops, bus stops, front porches, and even schoolyards have become makeshift chess arenas.\n\n“Before chess, we were lost,” said resident Francis Kachapilly, a recovered alcoholic. “It gave us focus, dignity.”\n\nAmong the village’s rising stars is 15-year-old Gowrishankar Jayaraj, who holds a FIDE rating of 2012 and ranks among the top 600 chess players in India, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nJayaraj aspires to follow in the footsteps of Gukesh Dommaraju, who made history in 2024 as the youngest-ever world chess champion.\n\nThe culture of chess runs so deep that Marottichal once hosted 1,001 simultaneous games, earning it the Universal Asian Record for the most amateur matches played concurrently in Asia.\n\nAt the heart of it all is Mr Unnikrishnan, now 67, affectionately hailed as the village’s saviour. He has personally taught over 1,000 villagers. “Chess gave us our pride back,” he says.\n\nIn 2023, filmmaker Kabeer Khurana captured the village’s journey in a poignant short film, The Pawn of Marottichal, showcasing how the black-and-white squares came to symbolise a community’s fight against its inner demons.\n\nThe Kerala Tourism Department today promotes Marottichal as a unique example of social reform through a simple, affordable game.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d8fa7a8a8ba483e6ab8b646520676efec9afaad1f43e09a3b4aaaef4b65c9b7b?w=825", "alt_text": "Residents of Marottichal engaged in a game of chess."}]}

The company is reportedly in contact with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture to address the issue.\n\nA trade organisation had earlier criticized Prada for commercialising the design without crediting the artisans who have preserved it for generations. Prada’s head of Corporate Social Responsibility, Lorenzo Bertelli, noted the sandals were still in an early design stage and expressed openness to dialogue with local Indian artisans, planning further meetings.\n\nKolhapuri sandals, named after the city where they are made, date back to the 12th century. Handcrafted from leather and sometimes dyed naturally, they are sturdy and suited to India’s climate. The Indian government awarded them Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2019, recognizing their regional authenticity.\n\nLocal artisans expressed disappointment over Prada’s lack of credit, with some highlighting how the sandals represent the hard work of Kolhapur leather workers and should bear the city’s name.\n\n“These sandals are made with the hard work of leather workers in Kolhapur. They should be named after Kolhapur.

Hawkers peddling Chinese and Indian fried noodles, oyster omelette, and more, would bring their carts to our doorsteps.\n\nAs I lived in a third-storey walk-up apartment in Haig Road, my mother would lower a basket tied to a rope with the money, and a packet of oyster omelette would be pulled up. Transaction completed – with no delivery charge.\n\nShe learnt this trick from our neighbours.\n\nLike them, we were spoilt for choice since Singapore’s food culture featured offerings from its diverse communities.\n\nIn the morning, there would be a hawker offering putu mayam, which is a South Indian snack of rice flour noodles, steamed and served with sweetened toppings such as grated coconut and palm sugar.\n\nSpice lovers can wait for the nasi lemak uncle. He offers the local favourite consisting of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk, typically served with fried anchovies, peanuts, cucumber, and a spicy sambal.\n\nThen, there is the carrot cake specialist serving a savoury dish made with cubes of glutinous rice flour and white radish that are fried and then combined with egg and various seasonings like chilli sauce and fish sauce.\n\nIn the afternoons, a young Javanese would come offering satay.\n\nThe ice-kacang man, who sold syrup-coated ice balls, was especially popular with children during the school holidays.\n\nWhile some hawkers carried their goods around in baskets attached to a shoulder yoke, others, like the kacang puteh uncle would have his assorted nuts in jars on a tray balanced on his head.\n\nOthers used bicycles, tricycles or carts to move around. Motorcycles were rare, as hawkers were not particularly affluent at the time.\n\nSoup noodle carts were usually customised with a small glass cabinet that displayed the ingredients. There was also a pot with separate compartments for the soup and boiling water, over a charcoal stove.\n\nThese hawkers would announce their presence by striking bamboo sticks or ringing a bell.\n\nEach featured a unique rhythm, and since they usually followed specific routes, they cultivated regular customers. Some of these hawkers became very familiar.\n\nMost hawkers were male so we would address them as uncles. The milkman however, was referred to as Bhai Susu. Although ‘bhai’ is Hindi for brother, it has become a friendly form of address for a man, while susu is Malay for milk.\n\nUnfortunately, food offered by these itinerant hawkers was often prepared in unhygienic conditions. Starting in 1971, the government relocated these travelling hawkers to hawker centres with proper amenities, providing them with a safe and hygienic place to conduct business.\n\nThat laid the foundation of Singapore’s hawker culture, which was officially added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020.\n\nOf the travelling hawkers, only the ice-cream man has been spared. He still visits neighbourhoods on his motorcycle and sidecar.\n\nThe ringing of his bell brings back some fond memories.\n\nHawker\n\nSingapore\n\nFood", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4ce81b61008623dd639070df4b082bf55d45bc24f4e16a01a569ad568ec7f43f?w=825", "alt_text": "A hawker in a Singapore street on Feb 25, 1960."}]}

Each train car has 32 seats, including four that can be folded to make space for a wheelchair, a pram or luggage.\n\nThe trains come with other accessibility features, including a hearing induction loop system that uses a magnetic field to transmit public announcements directly to the hearing aids of passengers who use such devices.\n\nIt is the first time such a system is being rolled out on a train in Singapore and Malaysia, so that broadcasts can be heard clearly by those who have hearing impairments without background noise and distortion.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, passengers can use a call button to speak to the operations control centre.\n\nThey can also evacuate by opening one of several red hatches with a lever to open the train doors. Opening the hatch will send an alarm to the operations control centre, and the lever can be used only when the train comes to a standstill.\n\nOnly the doors that face an emergency walkway along the RTS Link’s viaducts and tunnels can be opened.\n\nThere are also smoke and fire detectors on the train, and hopper windows that can be opened to allow fresh air into the cabin.\n\nThe first RTS Link train, which arrived in Singapore in April, is expected to undergo tests that ensure it works well with other rail systems, such as signalling and platform screen doors. These tests are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n“Carrying out an initial round of off-site testing at SRTC allows RTSO to identify and resolve potential integration issues early before commencing testing of the trains on the RTS Link tracks,” said Singapore and Malaysia’s transport ministries in a joint statement.\n\nAfter testing at SRTC, the first train will be moved to the RTS Link tracks between Singapore’s Woodlands North station and Johor’s Bukit Chagar station for more extensive trials that simulate actual service. This will last until the third quarter of 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, the next four trains that are due to be delivered are being assembled at CRRC’s facility in Batu Gajah, a town in Perak, Malaysia. The remaining three trains will also be assembled there.\n\nOnce completed, these seven trains will be sent directly to Wadi Hana depot in Johor Bahru for further testing before the 4km rail link opens. The final train is expected to be delivered by December.\n\nWhen operational, the RTS Link trains will travel at a maximum speed of 80kmh, carrying up to 10,000 people an hour in each direction.\n\nTrains will run from 6am to midnight daily, with a peak-hour frequency of 3.6 minutes. The journey will take about five minutes.\n\nThe contract to manufacture the RTS Link trains was awarded to CRRC in 2021.\n\nThe original plan was for the cross-border link to connect to Singapore’s Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), adopting the same systems and trains, and using the same depot as the TEL to reap economies of scale.\n\nBut the bilateral project was suspended in 2019 at the request of Malaysia, which proposed to use a light rail system instead to lower costs.\n\nThe project officially resumed in July 2020 on revised terms. When completed, the RTS Link is expected to ease congestion on the Causeway. More than 300,000 people cross the land bridge daily.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nSingapore\n\nTransport\n\nJohor Bahru", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/69bac8edd633fc98d1d26d342f686e7281080267a04245f55a247e10714729a0?w=825", "alt_text": "The 76.5m-long train of four cars, each with three doors on either side."}]}

In line with her signature mashup style, the song weaves together verses in both English and Punjabi.\n\nReleased on June 20 on all major music streaming platforms, the Bollywood-inspired tune doesn’t skimp on Vidya’s trademark airy vocals, which harmonise seamlessly with Devenderpal’s effortless, soulful voice. The music video was released a day later and showcases the singers performing a duet against a cinematic backdrop in the rural hillside.\n\nVidya currently has 7.62 million subscribers on YouTube and shot to fame when her mashup cover of The Chainsmokers’ Closer and Kabira from the 2013 Hindi film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani starring Ranbir Kapoor went viral eight years ago.\n\nAce\n\nVijay Sethupathy’s poker-themed Tamil film premiered in theatres worldwide on May 23 and recently became available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

It fits the plot, which follows ex-convict Kannan (Sethupathy) who moves abroad to start afresh and falls for the hyper-independent Rukku (Rukmini Vasanth). When she needs money to get out of a difficult situation, Kannan turns to an illegal gambling den introduced to him by his sidekick (Yogi Babu), banking on his poker skills to bail them out.\n\nThe rest of the film suffers from an identity crisis, fluctuating between romantic comedy and crime thriller, with a random bank heist thrown in.

The mother-daughter relationship is not romanticised, and such an authorial intention is unexpected for a first-time novelist.\n\nAnagha is an architect and environmental planner by training, holding degrees from the University of Pune and Arizona State University with a career spanning 24 years. The book was released globally on June 2 and is available on Amazon Singapore.\n\nSinger\n\nPunjabi\n\nMusic\n\nSingapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/550dea2b21561f54134722d849beee2280e9f822df75fc02a5e3f92c27c36cdd?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Mr Ramachandra was well known for his warm, engaging conversations with customers – a trait that earned him enduring loyalty and deep respect.\n\nFounder of Jothi Store and the Jothi Trading Group, Mr Ramachandra passed away on June 19, 2025, at 9 pm. He was born on December 21, 1931, in Thirumakkottai, a town near Mannargudi in Tamil Nadu, India, and arrived in Singapore at the age of 16.\n\nHe began his career as an office assistant at Tamil Murasu. While working, he took night classes and later joined the Singapore Tiger Standard newspaper, where he rose to become its chief library officer. When the company shut down in 1960, he lost his job and subsequently opened a small provision shop in a shophouse on Campbell Lane.\n\nOver the years, he rented the neighbouring shop, eventually purchasing the first floor of the current building. By 1992, he had acquired a five-storey building. His business flourished not only in Singapore but also expanded to Malaysia and India.\n\nJothi Store has since become a household name in the Singapore Indian community. Yet Mr Ramachandra never rested on his laurels. He was present at the store every day – it was rare to find him away. He believed that personally overseeing operations brought prosperity to the business. He maintained this daily routine until the final three weeks of his life.\n\nMr Murugaia Ramachandra manning the Jothi Store.\n\nPhoto: Ramachandra Family\n\nBeyond business, he offered fatherly advice to customers on matters such as weddings and funeral rites.\n\nHonorary Secretary of the Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association (LISHA), Mr Ruthirapathy Parthasarathy, who knew Mr Ramachandra for over 30 years, described him as an “unassuming philanthropist.”\n\n“Mr Ramachandra helped shopkeepers in Little India who were struggling to pay rent due to family circumstances. Much of the good he did was without fanfare,” said Mr Ruthirapathy.\n\nHe noted that Mr Ramachandra was a role model for aspiring entrepreneurs. “Despite his wealth, he placed strong emphasis on his children’s education. His eldest daughter, Jothi, excelled in the education field, while his other two daughters went into banking and nursing, respectively.”\n\nMr Ramachandra donated S$500,000 to build a hall at the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple and remained a generous supporter of temple functions and consecration ceremonies.\n\nDescribing him as a man of deep faith, Mr R. Mahendran, chairman of the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, said: “He visited temples regularly and was deeply concerned about their growth. He gave valuable suggestions. His passing is a great loss not only to temples, but to the wider Indian community.”\n\nMs Joyce Kingsley, owner of SIS Premium Meats, shared her cherished bond with him. Their families once lived in the same Selegie House neighbourhood. “A quiet but warm and compassionate human being. The memory of him opening my recent store and cutting the ribbon still warms my heart,” she said.\n\nIn a social media tribute, Singapore Indian Education Trust (SIET) wrote: “A firm believer in education, his quiet and sustained donations over the years have benefited hundreds of students.”\n\nThough he had made Singapore his permanent home, Mr Ramachandra never forgot his roots. Mr V. Ramamoorthy, owner of Chennai Trading & Supermart, said he helped restore many old and dilapidated temples in Thirumakkottai and its surrounding areas.\n\nMr Sunil Kumar, owner of Sai Baba Fashion on Dunlop Street, added that Mr Ramachandra had also built a school in Thirumakkottai.\n\n“The school was named after his mother, Ponnukannu Vedambal. Built in 2000, it now has 600 students,” he said.\n\nMr Ramachandra’s wife, Rajappa Dhanalakshmi – his devout and trusted companion – passed away in 2022 at the age of 85.\n\nHe is survived by three daughters, a son, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and extended family.\n\nThe family recalled that the patriarch was not only a beloved father and grandfather but also a mentor who lived by example.\n\nHis son, Mr Rajkumar, now owner of Jothi Store, said: “I once asked him, ‘Why are you giving away so much?’ My father replied, ‘Our business was supported by the Indian community in Singapore. We must give back to them.’”\n\nGrandson and LISHA Chairman Mr Raghunath Siva said, “My grandfather showed us that success in life is not measured by wealth or influence.”\n\n“There is a deep void in our hearts, but his legacy lives on.

Rajendran, trustee of the Arulmigu Velmurugan Temple in Jurong East, noted that Mr Ramachandra was one of the few who supported efforts to establish the temple in the 1990s.\n\nMr Abdul Samad, managing director of Hanifa Textiles, said Mr Ramachandra’s life and service had left an enduring mark on the community due to his foresight and unwavering commitment.\n\nMinister of State in the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the Ministry of Manpower Dinesh Vasu Dash, who was among several dignitaries at the wake, said the large turnout reflected Mr Ramachandra’s generous and philanthropic spirit.\n\nGrandson Ramanathan Ravindran added, “My grandfather built a great business through hard work and perseverance. His honourable character and good name will always live on.”\n\nKarthigesan Maniam, who is married to one of Mr Ramachandra’s granddaughters, said: “I’m proud to be part of a family led by such a widely respected man.”\n\nGranddaughter Malar shared: “Thatha (grandfather) shone as a guiding light in my life.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAnwarul Haque, Singapore’s pioneering Olympic hockey goalkeeper and one of the nation’s most celebrated sportsmen, passed away from age-related illness on June 23 at the age of 85.\n\nWidely regarded as a fearless figure on the field and a respected leader off it, he leaves behind a legacy that transcends sport.\n\nOnce hailed as the world’s best goalkeeper by A.S. Dara, then chairman of the International Hockey Federation’s technical committee, Anwarul’s impact on Singapore’s sporting landscape was immense.\n\nBorn in 1939 in Singapore, he was the eldest of seven children and quickly rose through the hockey ranks, displaying a rare blend of talent, tenacity and tactical brilliance.\n\nAnwarul’s international career began in 1956 when he was a junior on the Singapore team at the Melbourne Olympics. A year later, he became a full international, and in 1964, he was one of four Singaporeans selected to represent Malaysia at the Tokyo Olympics, where the team finished ninth out of 15.\n\nHe also represented Singapore at the 1962 and 1970 Asian Games, finishing fifth in both, and helped the national side win silver at the 1971 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games.\n\nInside-right Devinder Randhawa, 76, who played along with Anwarul at the 1970 Asian Games in Bangkok and the 1971 SEAP Games in Kuala Lumpur where Singapore won silver, said: “Undoubtedly, Anwarul was the best goalkeeper I ever played with. He was sharp and brave. Those days the goalkeepers did not have much protection. I have seen him stop shots with his bare chest. He was talented and very quick. He built a formidable reputation from his school days at Beatty Secondary.”\n\nAnwarul’s fearlessness was legendary. In a 1993 interview, he famously said: “I’ve stopped hockey sticks with my face. My friends still remind me how I once headed the ball away. I didn’t know the meaning of fear when I was in goal.”\n\nFormer teammate Harbajan Singh Loomba, 88, recalled their time together fondly: “Anwarul was an outstanding goalkeeper. He would use his hands, legs, anything to block the ball. Even after becoming a lawyer, he remained humble and friendly – a true gentleman.”\n\nAnother teammate, M. Jeevananthan, 69, remembered a 1972 match against the Indian Association. “Anwarul saved 16 shots on goal that day. He was the Ceylon Sports Club captain and led us to a 2-0 win. He was incredible.”\n\nOff the pitch, Anwarul pursued an equally distinguished legal career. Graduating with honours in law from the University of Singapore, he went on to serve as a magistrate, district judge and deputy director of the Legal Aid Bureau.\n\nHe retired from international hockey in 1972 and the local scene in 1978 but continued to shape the game, serving on the Singapore Hockey Association’s management committee and as its president from 1985 to 1992.\n\nAnwarul Haque with then Senior \nMinister Tharman Shanmugaratnam (centre) and M. Jeevananthan (fifth from left) at the opening of the Hockey Village in Boon Lay on Aug 21, 2019.\n\nPhoto: Sport Singapore\n\nHe was also deeply involved with the Singapore Cricket Club (SCC), where he was a progressive force for gender equality. As SCC president from 2001 to 2008, he oversaw key changes that opened voting rights and club spaces to women for the first time in over a century. “Times have changed,” he said then. “I had fought for women to be more active in this club since the day I became a general committee member.”\n\nIn 2009, Anwarul was appointed to the inaugural executive committee of the Singapore Olympians Association, where he mentored young athletes and helped promote Olympic values in Singapore.\n\nAnwarul is survived by his wife Rita Minjoot, sons Shehzad, Tariq and Kamil, and three grandchildren.\n\nSon Shehzad’s tribute\n\nMy dad was a wonderful personality who was an inspiration to many and, in particular, to me. He inculcated his love of sports in me from a very young age (Shehzad is 49 now).\n\nHe always encouraged me to play as many sports as possible, and it was one of the reasons he sent me to boarding school in the UK.\n\nBut, because of the dangers he had faced in hockey, he never pushed me in that direction. And  I’m glad I never went down that path and face comparisons with such a legend!\n\nIt was never easy to please him. When I was playing international cricket (for Singapore from 1994 to 2001), he would quietly watch me and then give his review of my performance, often wanting me to demand more of myself.

That was the message to 370 people at Singapore’s “Largest Mass Chair Yoga” session at Toa Payoh on June 22.\n\nThe session was conducted by volunteer trainers from Nikam Guruji Yoga Kutir, a yoga centre, and recognised by the Singapore Book of Records, surpassing the previous record of 215 participants set by the staff of PCF Sparkletots Preschool in December 2023.\n\nChair yoga started in 1982 when a yoga instructor in the United States noticed that one of her students, a woman in her 30s with arthritis, had difficulty getting down onto the floor. She adapted some poses for use while seated on a chair and since then, chair yoga has been widely practiced around the world.\n\nRama Prasad, the current chairman of Nikam Guruji, said he and his team developed the line-up of chair yoga postures specifically for the event organised in conjunction with SG60 and International Day of Yoga.\n\nVolunteer trainers from Nikam Guruji facilitating the Mass Chair Yoga session.\n\nPhoto: Zaobao\n\n“We stipulated what are the postures that we needed to do and took a lot of care to check for stability so that people don’t fall off the chair. We made sure the postures are very easy and even wrote down the script so that we were very clear in our instructions,” he explained.\n\nThe event was held at a sheltered basketball court next to the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council.\n\n“There was a lot of enthusiasm and interest in yoga from the residents. We decided on mass chair yoga so that even the senior citizens could come and participate,” said Toa Payoh West Indian Activity Executive Committee chairman Vangoor Govindarajan Balachander.\n\nThe session lasted just over an hour and included 10 chair postures, three breathing exercises, three standing postures and concluded with four rounds of the 12-step sun salute.\n\nAll the participants performing the spinal twist yoga pose.\n\nPhoto: Zaobao\n\nMost of the older participants performed the yoga poses effortlessly, though one or two would amusingly raise their left hand when it was supposed to be the right. To watch all 370 heads turn in unison during the spinal twist pose was a remarkable sight to behold.\n\nAmong the participants was a wheelchair-bound senior. Another senior, fresh from a grocery run at the nearby wet market joined the session with her shopping trolley in tow.\n\nMinister for National Development and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Chee Hong Tat arrived in time to perform the sun salute along with the residents.\n\nMinister for National Development Chee Hong Tat performing the sun salute with the other participants.\n\nPhoto: Zaobao\n\n“Yoga can be done on a chair, it can also be done on a mat.

Kavi\n\nReema Dudekula\n\nSujatha Asokan’s journey to becoming the head chef of Quenino, one of Singapore’s most innovative restaurants, began in the unlikeliest of places: a Burger King kitchen.\n\nAt 14, flipping burgers wasn’t glamorous work, but it was here that Sujatha learned discipline, precision, and timing, which are skills that would form the foundation of her culinary career.\n\nFrom that unassuming start, the 34-year-old’s path has been defined by a singular commitment to growth. Today, as the head chef, also known as ‘Chef de Cuisine’ she oversees a kitchen that fuses the rich traditions of Southeast Asian cooking with modern techniques.\n\nBut it’s more than just a balancing act. In her hands, tradition becomes a springboard for reinvention.\n\nChef Sujatha plating a dish at Quenino.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nSujatha was born in Singapore to a Malaysian Chinese mother and a Singaporean Indian father. Her upbringing was shaped by the intersection of cultures, where food was not merely a means of nourishment but a language through which family members communicated.\n\n“I grew up in the kitchen, watching my aunts, parents, and grandparents cook,” she recalled. “It was a place of constant curiosity for me. I wanted to understand what made every dish come alive.”\n\nHer maternal grandmother, a revered figure in the family, played a pivotal role in shaping Sujatha’s philosophy of cooking. More than just teaching her how to combine ingredients, her grandmother imparted an understanding of what it meant to experiment in the kitchen.\n\nHer first real step into professional cooking came through a part-time job at Burger King, but it was only after her O Levels that Sujatha began to seriously pursue her passion. With encouragement from a teacher who noticed her aptitude for food science, she enrolled in a Baking and Culinary Science diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic.\n\n“Food and nutrition was the only A I received in my O Levels,” Sujatha said. “It just made sense.”\n\nHer rise through Singapore’s competitive culinary scene took her from Temasek Polytechnic to some of the city’s most respected kitchens, including Stellar at 1-Altitude and Pollen.\n\nEach position added a new layer of refinement to her skills, but it was at Botanico, where she became head chef, that she truly began to find her voice.\n\nThere, she merged the vibrant flavors of Southeast Asia with global culinary techniques, creating dishes that were both familiar and new. When Quenino opened its doors in 2023, it was the culmination of her vision – a restaurant that honors the traditions of Southeast Asian cuisine while pushing those boundaries into unexplored territory.\n\nA dish at Quenino.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nSujatha’s approach to leadership is one of collaboration, not command. In an industry often marked by hierarchical structures, she emphasizes trust and mutual respect within her team. “Skills can be taught,” she said, “but attitude is everything.”\n\nIt’s an ethos that has allowed Quenino to flourish as a creative space, where the chefs are given the freedom to experiment and grow. Every six months, the team undergoes a complete menu revamp, a process that includes research trips to find new ingredients and explore new ideas.\n\nIn one such trip to Cameron Highlands, Sujatha stumbled upon tamarillos, a fruit native to South America. “It’s like a spicy passionfruit,” she said, “and we decided to experiment with it.” It now forms one of the amuse-bouches on Quenino’s menu.\n\nA dish at Quenino.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nPart of the challenge at Quenino, she explains, is working with unfamiliar ingredients and flavors, often even those that the team initially dislikes. For the current menu, the chefs purposefully selected ingredients they found difficult to work with. “It forces you to be more creative,” she said. The result is a menu that is not just about new flavors, but about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.\n\nSous Chef Chung An Dric, who has worked alongside Sujatha for years, underscores the importance of creative freedom in Quenino’s kitchen.\n\nSous Chef Chung An Dric and Chef Sujatha Asokan.\n\nT. Kavi\n\n“It’s a partnership, not just a job,” he said, noting that Sujatha’s approach has fostered a unique and collaborative environment. Their relationship is grounded in trust and mutual respect, and it’s this dynamic that has become central to the restaurant’s success.\n\nDespite her rising acclaim – including being named Rising Chef of the Year at the World Gourmet Summit, Sujatha measures success differently. “Food isn’t just about feeding someone,” she said. “It’s about connection.”\n\nOutside the kitchen, she unwinds by traveling to eat her way through the region, hunting for new ingredients and ideas. “And I play badminton with friends,” she added, laughing. “It helps to whack a few things now and then.” She also treasures moments of quiet rest – “just catching up on sleep and doing absolutely nothing.”\n\nThrough her work, Sujatha shows that innovation doesn’t mean abandoning roots, it means using them as creative fuel. At Quenino, she and her team are building a new kind of kitchen: one where the future of Southeast Asian cuisine is constantly being rewritten, one memory-laced dish at a time.\n\nRestaurant\n\nFood\n\nChef", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/1924dd61167bb5f1548f16d2b7a9b31893e6ce964e3f6fcbd9db981d668b7b7c?w=825", "alt_text": "Chef Sujatha before service at Quenino."}]}

But his achievements in India and abroad left his peers and even mentors unmoved. It was time to move on.\n\nWhat changed his life was a fortuitous interview in London with Emeritus Professor Sittampalam Shanmugaratnam, the legendary Singaporean obstetrician and gynaecologist. The young man was employed immediately.\n\nIn Singapore, he faced the perils and promise of the unknown.\n\n“I knew no one here. I knew no Mandarin, Malay or Tamil. I had no referral base to send me patients. But I did not need any of that. I found a country where talent and skills are valued, where clinical and research work is prized. There’s a term for that kind of system: Meritocracy.”\n\nHow about life outside work, I ask. “I immediately felt at home here. Singapore is safe and honest and dedicated to excellence. I fell in love with it immediately.”\n\nBut Singapore is his second love. His first is his wife, Tapati, whom he met while he was studying at Calcutta Medical College and she was studying Botany at Presidency College, a heartbeat of a street away.\n\nThe couple has a cardiologist daughter, Sinjini, educated in Singapore and trained in Australia and Britain, who works in Melbourne.\n\nSo far, so good. But what about the future of the human race, including in Singapore? What is to explain the socially suicidal drop in birth rates in this country?\n\nThe amiability in Prof. Biswas vanishes. He turns darkly sociological.\n\n“The problem is structural. Women want to be successful in their careers before getting into a serious relationship, let alone marriage and motherhood. There is nothing wrong with this.\n\n“This issue exists across the developed world and not only in Singapore. Yet, everywhere, by the time a woman becomes a mother, she needs to balance many duties, including her accumulated success at work. Couples depend to an extent on their parents to bring up children, except that those parents, too, who themselves delayed parenthood, are ageing.”\n\nSingapore has affordable, full-time domestic workers, who are an economic luxury elsewhere in the developed world. But the cost of living here is high. While Singapore has many pro-natalist policies, and these do help, the country needs a mindset change so that it remains viable demographically, he says. What is that mindset change? A preference for new life.\n\nProf. Biswas does not give up hope. He has delivered the children of the children whom he had delivered. Life goes on, as it should. “To bring a life into this world is wonderful because every life is unique.”\n\nThis, then, is the baby doctor, a man who, even in the prominence that his age has bestowed on him, has not forgotten that he was born one day. He does not believe in retirement because it is impossible to retire from life. “I am not tired,” he says.\n\nI am about to ask him what keeps him young when his handphone rings. “Is she ready to deliver?” he asks. “Yes,” comes the reply.\n\nHe walks away briskly towards the maternity ward.\n\nA child is soon born.\n\nAnother baby for Singapore.\n\nSingapore\n\nDoctor\n\nIndia\n\nUniversity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d1703665bedb2f7265534bb9cd8b32b081225e59fd86a8547a747367d3a297a0?w=825", "alt_text": "Professor Arijit Biswas has delivered more than 14,000 babies in his 35 years as an obstetrician."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nFor many, TikTok and Instagram Reels are just for fun or to pass time. But for 45-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident Nandu Rapolu, these short videos have unexpectedly opened the doors to Tamil cinema.\n\nOn July 27, Nandu will make his big-screen debut as the lead in the Tamil thriller 13/13 Lucky Nun, releasing simultaneously in Tamil Nadu, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nBorn and raised in Hyderabad, Rapolu moved to Singapore in 2003 and became a Permanent Resident in April 2010. By profession, he works in the IT department at UOB, which remains his main livelihood.\n\nBut, alongside his banking career, he has quietly nurtured a deep passion for films – distributing Telugu movies in Singapore and creating social media videos that unexpectedly earned him a fan following.\n\nHis journey into acting is as unconventional as it is inspiring.\n\nIt all began during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Like millions worldwide stuck at home, Nandu decided to experiment with TikTok and Reels simply to kill time.\n\n“Actually, I started experimenting with Reels when the Coronavirus started,” he recalls with a laugh. But one video led to another, and soon he found himself collaborating with his cousin Surekha Nunna, based in Atlanta, United States.\n\nTogether, they recreated hit Telugu songs, playing male and female roles and syncing scenes seamlessly across continents.\n\nTheir videos struck a chord with viewers. Out of 25 reels they made, 20 crossed the one million view mark, with their most popular – a song from the 2014 Telugu film Geetanjali – registering 2.9 million views.\n\nNandu’s confident dancing and genuine love for cinema didn’t go unnoticed. Even renowned Indian producer Kona Venkat shared one of Nandu’s Reels on his own Instagram, boosting his visibility further.\n\nThis social media fame caught the attention of Chennai-based filmmaker Megna Jaison, the driving force behind 13/13 Lucky Nun.\n\nMegna, who wears multiple hats as producer, actress, scriptwriter and music director for the film, came across Nandu’s energetic Reels and was immediately convinced he had the screen presence to pull off a hero’s role.\n\n“She liked my dancing, so she offered me this role,” says Nandu, still sounding surprised by how quickly things escalated.\n\n13/13 Lucky Nun is a supernatural thriller shot in Malaysia and Tamil Nadu. The plot revolves around a group of friends who unwittingly encounter a restless spirit in an abandoned house, setting off a chain of eerie and suspenseful events.\n\nNandu Rapolu in a scene from 13/13 Lucky Nun.\n\nPHOTO: NANDU RAPOLU\n\nNandu plays a lover boy who proposes to Megna’s character, creating moments of romance, comedy and plenty of dance sequences. “I have love scenes, three songs, some comedy. We even shot with a Lamborghini! It was so much fun,” he says, beaming.\n\nThough this marks his acting debut, Nandu is no stranger to the world of cinema. He has been distributing Telugu films in Singapore since 2014, partnering with other local distributors and handling releases of about 30 films so far.\n\nHe has close ties with Telugu film circles. His cousin Rapolu Ananda Bhaskar is a former MP from Telangana, which helped Nandu establish ties with Telugu megastar Chiranjeevi.\n\nHowever, stepping in front of the camera for a feature film was a whole new ball game. “This is my first acting role. I did cover songs before, but acting in a full-length movie was different. The director and assistant director really helped me. Dubbing was tough as I am not fluent in Tamil, so they hired another person for my voice,” Nandu candidly admits.\n\nDespite the challenges, his performance earned praise during the film’s audio launch in Chennai on May 17.\n\nProminent figures like actor SV Sekar and National Award-winning director Thambi Ramaiah lauded his dance and screen presence, encouraging him to take his acting career more seriously. “They told me I have a bright future in Tamil cinema,” Nandu says proudly.\n\nWhile 13/13 Lucky Nun is just days away from hitting theatres, the buzz has already brought new opportunities.\n\nMegna has cast Nandu again in her upcoming project, where he’ll play an assistant commissioner of police in a crime thriller.\n\n“Nandu did well in his first film,” she said. “But he still has to learn the craft. He is quite natural, and also hard-working. He will go far.”\n\nOffers have also started trickling in from Hyderabad’s Telugu film industry, but Nanduu remains cautious.\n\n“Telugu producers want me to move to India for 45 days at a stretch, but I can’t leave my job and family in Singapore. Tamil films finish my scenes in four days – that works for me,” he said.\n\nThis balance between a steady IT job and a budding acting career might sound unusual, but Nandu is determined to manage both as long as he can.\n\n“UOB is my bread and butter. Acting and distributing movies – that’s my passion,” he says.\n\n“This is my first acting role. I did cover songs before, but acting in a full movie was different.

Srikanth, reportedly co-producing a recent film, said he accepted the drugs as compensation and gradually developed an addiction.\n\n“I made a mistake by consuming drugs,” Srikanth told the court during his remand hearing.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFormer Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh, once feared for his steely determination on the pitch, has long swapped his bat for a purpose that hits closer to the heart: giving hope to those who need it most.\n\nOn June 11 in Singapore, Waugh played charity golf at the Sentosa Golf Club and raised an impressive $170,000 at a dinner for Magic Bus, a non-profit dedicated to lifting children out of poverty in India.\n\nMagic Bus may be one of India’s best-kept secrets for transforming young lives, but thanks to Waugh, more people now know its name.\n\n“Fifteen years ago, as a Laureus World Sports Academy member, I visited Magic Bus in Mumbai,” Waugh recounts. “Back then, Matthew Spacie (Magic Bus founder) was literally picking up kids from Dharavi’s slums, taking them to play sports, mentoring them and teaching them life skills. To see how it’s grown to reach millions is incredible.”\n\nMagic Bus, founded by British entrepreneur Matthew Spacie, runs its “Childhood to Livelihood” programme for over three million youth across India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. Its mission is clear: break the cycle of poverty by equipping children with education, employable skills and the confidence to thrive.\n\nAccording to Spacie, having high-profile ambassadors like Waugh helps open doors. “When Steve’s name is on an invite, new faces turn up. Many in Singapore didn’t know Magic Bus until they came to see Steve – and now they do. That’s game-changing for us.”\n\nFor Waugh, India has been a canvas for both cricketing glory and life-changing epiphanies. His passion for the country’s warmth and resilience sparked after meeting Mother Teresa in Kolkata in 1996 – an encounter that steered him towards philanthropy.\n\n“I’ve always been fascinated by India. My first tour in 1995 had a profound effect. Meeting Mother Teresa, then visiting Udayan – a rehab centre for children affected by leprosy – made me realise I couldn’t just walk away after seeing that reality,” he told tabla!.\n\nIn 1998, Waugh began raising funds for Udayan’s girls’ wing, Nivedita Bhavan, ensuring that girls from families affected by leprosy could receive care and education, shielding them from the dire fates that often awaited them.\n\nOver two decades later, the bond remains strong, just as his dedication to uplifting the voiceless endures.\n\nSport, Waugh believes, is the greatest leveller – a theme he’s championed since his cricketing days.\n\n“Cricket in India is not just a sport; it’s a religion, a force that unites people regardless of background. That’s the beauty of sport – it makes everyone equal once you step onto the field,” he says.\n\nPhotography has become another avenue for Waugh to tell the story of India’s spirit and its enduring love for cricket.\n\nAfter retiring, he spent 20 days traversing rural India, capturing 20,000 images that culminated in his book, The Spirit of Cricket – India.\n\nThe book and its accompanying Netflix documentary Capturing Cricket, offer a raw, heartfelt look at cricket’s power to bind a nation.\n\nWhile cricket made him a hero, it’s the quiet refusal to rest on his laurels that makes Waugh a champion of compassion.\n\n“Meeting Mother Teresa showed me that a life of giving is a life well-lived,” he reflects. “If you’re privileged, you have a duty to help the less fortunate. It doesn’t take a lot – just the will to act.”\n\nSports\n\nCricket\n\nIndia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/349ad3f10198a0528bacccfdcd92b59f6275c4df5da39d247d24914613f74146?w=825", "alt_text": "Steve Waugh (right) helping with the auction at the Magic Bus charity dinner in Singapore"}]}

These are made by Indian artisans for Rs300–Rs1,500. No credit. No history. Just rebranding and theft,” posted one user on X.\n\n“This design was stolen from the Chamar community who’ve handcrafted these for generations. It’s cultural theft dressed up as luxury,” another added.\n\nIndian fashion historians and designers also expressed concern. Ritu Sethi, a noted fashion researcher, said: “Kolhapuris are not just sandals – they are a living tradition. It’s deeply disheartening to see such crafts showcased globally without acknowledgment.”\n\nThe uproar reignites a familiar debate around cultural appropriation in fashion, particularly how global luxury brands continue to borrow from traditional aesthetics without giving due credit or sharing benefits with the original communities.\n\nKolhapuri chappals trace their roots back to the 12th century, with unique designs crafted by local artisans, often from marginalised communities.\n\nThe footwear is not only a staple of Indian culture but also holds a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, affirming its authenticity and origin. Crafted by hand and requiring up to six weeks to make, Kolhapuris are celebrated for their durability and heritage.\n\nAuthor and cultural commentator Shobhaa De, whose family hails from Kolhapur, offered a more nuanced take on the controversy.\n\n“We should be flattered, not outraged,” she said in a TV interview, even holding up her own Kolhapuris. “If anything, this might be an indirect tribute. Maybe it will lead to a revival.”\n\nBut many disagree. The central concern isn’t the use of the design – it’s the erasure of its identity. As one critic put it: “Rebranding Indian tradition as Western innovation isn’t tribute – it’s colonisation by couture.”\n\nPrada’s Kolhapuri controversy echoes similar instances of Indian aesthetics being rebranded without context. Scarves that resemble dupattas have been dubbed “Scandinavian minimalism.” Lehenga-style skirts are sold as “Y2K maxis.” Even Alia Bhatt’s saree at Cannes was labelled a “gown” by Western media outlets.\n\nFashion insiders argue that such oversights aren’t isolated – they reflect systemic issues in the global fashion industry where artisanal labour is undervalued and cultural heritage commodified.\n\n“It’s time global brands adopt ethical design practices,” one post read. “Credit the culture, pay the communities. That’s the real luxury.”\n\nThe original Kolhapuri chappals\n\nPhoto: x", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5b8d3ff3a56be1b762f1c50141ac778264a6d5354174dfd1014551a389c8b9bc?w=825", "alt_text": "Prada’s Kolhapuri-style chappals."}]}

But when he married another woman in February, she felt humiliated and vengeful,” Mr Singhal told reporters.\n\nIn an effort to destroy his reputation, she launched a digital terror campaign using his name, sending hoax bomb threats to schools, hospitals and even stadiums.\n\nThe case first came to light when Geneva Liberal School in Ahmedabad received a chilling e-mail on June 3 warning of an imminent blast.\n\nThe e-mail also referenced an alleged rape in a Hyderabad hotel in 2023 – fabricated to gain police attention. Soon, other institutions began receiving similar e-mails, including Narendra Modi Stadium, BJ Medical College and Divya Jyoti School.\n\nThe panic spread beyond Gujarat. Bomb threats were reported across Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Bihar, Telangana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. Some of the threats were timed to coincide with VIP visits or religious events, prompting heightened security deployments.\n\nIn one e-mail sent to BJ Medical College after the tragic AI-171 Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, the sender falsely claimed responsibility: “Like we sent you mail yesterday, we crashed the Air India plane with our former CM… Now you know we are not playing.”\n\nThe breadth of the hoax forced police departments across states to coordinate with Ahmedabad’s cybercrime unit. Joshilda remained undetected for months due to her meticulous digital camouflage.\n\n“She was very smart, and left no obvious trail,” said Mr Singhal. “But one mistake exposed her.”\n\nAccording to investigators, six months ago, Joshilda inadvertently logged into both her real and fake e-mail accounts from the same device. This revealed her IP address and provided the breakthrough cyber teams needed.\n\nShe was arrested from her residence in Chennai following this lead, and digital as well as physical evidence was recovered during the search.\n\nPolice say Joshilda used Prasad, a former AIADMK party IT wing administrator now in custody, as an indirect connection. The original investigation into Prasad’s involvement in a bar brawl and alleged drug activity led to scrutiny of suspicious e-mails, which eventually uncovered Joshilda’s involvement.\n\nBeyond the emotional motive, Joshilda’s behaviour has prompted broader questions about psychological health and cybercrime. “She let her personal rejection evolve into a national security threat,” an officer said, adding that the investigation continues to uncover other digital assets and potential accomplices.\n\nKarnataka police have also stepped in, confirming that Udupi schools had received similar hoax threats. “We will seek custody of Rene Joshilda after Gujarat police conclude their investigation,” said Udupi Superintendent of Police Hariram Shankar.\n\nWhile Joshilda awaits legal proceedings, her case has ignited conversations on the misuse of technology for personal vendetta and the need for better mental health awareness in high-pressure professional environments.\n\nHer arrest marks the end of a bizarre saga, but investigations into the full extent of the digital damage – and its emotional fallout – have only just begun.\n\nRene Joshilda Chennai-based MNC consultant before her arrest.\n\nPhoto: X\n\n“She was very smart, and left no obvious trail.

{"article_url": "https://www.tabla.com.sg/community/opinion/science-weight-gain", "site_title": "The Science of Weight Gain", "publish_date": null, "content": "Community\n\nThe Science of Weight Gain\n\nUPDATED\n\nJun 22, 2025, 5:35 AM\n\nPaddy Rangappa\n\nI often say “food is fun”. But, unlike some philosophers who say wise stuff but don’t do what they say, I walk the talk.\n\nI enjoy my meals, snacks and stuff in between. But, on my path to fun eating, I often encounter a familiar roadblock: My wife.\n\nShe began a crusade to control my weight early in our marriage, despite my pointing out that, if she were successful, she would have less husband to interact with.\n\nOver the years, she has steadfastly maintained that my weight problem has something to do with my eating (excessively) and exercising (inadequately).\n\nWhen I find a dessert particularly enjoyable, which happens on weekdays and weekends, she asks me to desist from having a third helping. And, when I put up my feet to watch an enthralling television programme like American Ninja Warrior, she suggests I visit the actual gym instead.\n\nA few years ago, while idly browsing the internet, I hit on an article that piqued my interest. I read it with rising excitement, printed out the relevant portion in large font and walked over to my wife in the kitchen.\n\n“For years, you’ve insisted my weight problem has to do with my habits,” I said, injecting a blend of pain and accusation in my tone. She looked anything but contrite. “I insist again, now,” she said.\n\n“You’re wrong!” I said. “Recent research shows that my weight problem has nothing to do with me but with my friends. Fatness breeds fatness in the fraternity. Obesity spreads like conjunctivitis from friend to mate to chum. So if I’m not lithe and lissome like a fishing rod, the fault lies with my not-so-slim pals. Here, read this.”\n\nI affixed the printed note to the refrigerator and watched with satisfaction as she read the section I had selected: “In analysing the Framingham data, Dr Christakis and Dr Fowler found that friends, and friends of friends, had similar levels of obesity, but neighbours did not.\n\n“Dr Christakis and Dr Fowler proposed a few possible explanations...\n\nThe third explanation… was contagion… its effect was large. They theorised that a person’s idea of an acceptable weight changes when he sees how big his friends are or how much they eat.”\n\nShe stared at the paper, speechless. I continued.\n\n“My weight problem is caused by the stout company surrounding me. For example…” I named a few of my friends who carry a lot of weight, literally.\n\nFor a few days, I enjoyed seeing the paragraph in big letters on the fridge whenever I opened its door to access goodies. More than that, I enjoyed not hearing that the goodies would not do my waistline any good.\n\nTwo weeks later, it was gone. Thinking it might have slipped under the magnet, I began looking for it on the floor.\n\n“I’ve torn it up,” said my wife, a nasty grin on her face. “Today I realised what was wrong. It said the scientists had proposed “a few possible explanations” but you had omitted the first two. Why didn’t you give me the full article to read?”\n\n“Oh, the rest was just technical stuff that would’ve bored you,” I said airily. “The point is these two renowned doctors are very gung-ho about the third explanation.”\n\nHer grin became wider. “You did not include the part about many scientists being sceptical about the findings of Christakis and Fowler,” she said. “Let me read from the same article.”\n\nWithout any sense of shame, she had copied my method and printed something herself. She began to read aloud: ‘Those surprising conclusions have drawn heated criticism from other scientists who claim that the studies’ methodology was flawed and the original data completely inadequate to estimate the role that contagion might play in the spread of these behaviours.”\n\nI said: “I wouldn’t pay that much heed. The point is Christakis and Fowler are firm about their conclusions.\n\n“Scientists are always sceptical about other scientists’ work – that’s the way the game is played.”\n\n“And of course, you’re an expert on scientific matters,” she said.\n\nI smiled modestly.\n\n“I was being sarcastic,” she said. “In any case, even if there is some truth in this, I can’t go around convincing your friends to lose weight so that the ripples will reach you, and cause your kilogrammes to diminish. Sorry, we will stick to the age-old technique: more exercise and less eating for you.”\n\nAs usual, when faced with scientific evidence, she had dug in her heels and stuck to her archaic viewpoint. I wondered if she was so stubborn because of her friends.\n\nColumn", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/fb5743f2306548f81a2c2a6eb0f7cd265d0bb80a37bf11642522f4b7bb4a98da?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Now, thanks to Thiruben’s grit and relentless dedication, the record has finally fallen – and in spectacular fashion.\n\n“I’m usually someone who doesn’t get too nervous before competing,” Thiruben told tabla!. “But this time, I certainly had more nerves than usual – and excitement too. I knew I was capable of running a national record based on my training times.”\n\nFor Thiruben, the moment his new national record flashed on the scoreboard is one he will remember forever.\n\n“When I saw that I’d run below 1:50, I immediately turned to my coaches and teammates in the stands – they were all celebrating. There were tears shed by my coaches and family who’ve been with me every step of the way,” he shared, reliving the emotional moment.\n\nInterestingly, Thiruben’s journey to becoming Singapore’s middle-distance record holder did not begin on the track but on a football field.\n\n“I used to play football for the Junior Sports Academy, alongside many players now in the national team. I was usually a right back or right winger,” he recalled with a smile.\n\nBut fate intervened when he was in National Junior College, where football wasn’t offered as a co-curricular activity. Forced to choose something else, he picked track and field – and there was no turning back.\n\nIn his first year, he represented the Singapore Schools team and won an international gold medal in the 1500m.\n\n“My passion for running started then, and I knew I wanted to be a national athlete one day,” he said.\n\nThis historic run in South Korea was not by chance but the result of a carefully planned season and unrelenting hard work.\n\nIn the lead-up, Thiruben tested himself in races in Australia, Singapore and the Philippines. However, it was his time training with the elite middle-distance runners at Waseda University in Japan that gave him the sharpest edge.\n\n“I was training with runners who were faster than me. It pushed my limits and helped me adapt to the weather and conditions, which are similar to South Korea’s,” he explained.\n\nRunning runs in Thiruben’s veins. His father, Thana Rajan, was a runner during his youth in Malaysia and now competes for Singapore in Masters athletics (age 35+). That family tradition has clearly inspired Thiruben, the eldest of four siblings, to chase big dreams on the track.\n\nDespite his demanding training – 11 sessions a week over six days, often twice a day – Thiruben remains grounded.\n\nA graduate of Deakin University in Melbourne with a Bachelor of Business in Sport Management, he now works as a marketing and sponsorship executive at Singapore Athletics, also managing its social media pages.\n\nHis biggest comfort? Home-cooked meals after gruelling sessions.\n\n“My favourite food at home would be the healthy dinners my mum cooks – pasta with grilled chicken or brown rice with salmon,” he said.\n\nA student of the sport, Thiruben draws inspiration from global stars like Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Marco Arop, whose training videos he watches religiously. He’s also an avid reader of sports autobiographies; his recent read was Running My Life by legendary middle-distance runner Sebastian Coe.\n\nHis personal motto is simple but powerful: “With determination, anything is possible.” In the world of athletics, he says, mental strength is just as crucial as physical endurance.\n\nSaid Khairyll Amri, Thiruben’s coach and a former teammate: “Thiruben always goes the extra mile for his goal. He reads up on training strategies, suggests new ideas, and is constantly learning.\n\n“And even though track is an individual sport, he’s a true team player – always supporting his teammates, especially when they’re struggling with form or injuries. That says a lot about his character.”\n\nWith this milestone behind him, Thiruben is now focused on scaling new heights. His ambition is clear: to continue lowering his time and represent Singapore on even bigger stages, including the Asian Games and, one day, the Olympics.\n\n“Thiruben always goes the extra mile for his goal.

What he found was an unexpected calling to work as a pet mortician.\n\nWorking with Mobile Pet Cremation Services for the last seven years, Mr Guna now provides compassionate care to families in their moments of loss.\n\nGrowing up in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, Mr Guna came from humble beginnings. His family lived in a rented home – his father drove a rental vehicle, while his mother stitched clothes as a tailor to support them.\n\n“There were no good jobs in my hometown, and I needed to support my parents and younger sister. That is why I decided to go overseas,” Mr Guna said.\n\nAfter finishing his diploma in engineering, Mr Guna worked as a trainee at an automobile company for three years.\n\nHis path to his current job as a pet mortician was far from straightforward. Before coming to Singapore, he was scammed by an unscrupulous agent that promised him a job but disappeared after collecting his certificates and resume.\n\n“I felt helpless and betrayed. I thought all my hopes were lost,” Mr Guna recalled.\n\nDespite the setback, through a licensed job agency he heard about from a friend, Mr Guna secured the pet mortician job in Singapore.\n\n“My mother was very apprehensive about me taking that job. She told me to reconsider, especially after paying about 8,000 rupees agent fee. But I was determined to work any job,” Mr Guna said.\n\nHe now cremates pets like cats, dogs, guinea pigs, even fish and many other animals, including conducting religious-based ceremonies to honour different faiths.\n\n“This is an emotional job, and it has taught me patience,” Mr Guna said.\n\nThe furnace Mr Guna operates reaches temperatures exceeding 1,000 deg C, demanding strict safety protocols and routine maintenance to ensure smooth and efficient operation.\n\nBeyond returning ashes in personalised urns, Mr Guna notes that many pet owners choose to honour their companions in unique ways – such as storing ashes in chain lockets. He also offers paw print services, creating keepsakes from the pet’s paw as a lasting memento.\n\nWhile Mr Guna quickly grasped both the technical and emotional demands of the job, language proved to be one of his biggest challenges. His limited English made it hard to communicate with pet owners, especially during emotionally charged moments.\n\n“At first, I was nervous speaking with customers. I learned basic English by listening, talking, and messaging customers,” he said.\n\nOperations manager of Mobile Pet Cremation Services Alvin Seah, 52, highlighted that Mr Guna is a rare gem.\n\n“His quiet strength brings peace and assurance to both grieving pet owners and our team. Humble and always eager to learn, he meets every challenge with calm positivity and unwavering dedication. With empathy in his heart and purpose in his hands, he shows us what best efforts and true service truly mean,” Mr Alvin said.\n\n“When I witnessed the whole process of how Mr Guna handled my pet, caressing him and talking to him softly during his paw imprint before sending him into the chamber, my heart felt at ease. I know I have found the right place to send off my little one to a better place,” noted Tricia, a customer of Mr Guna, on Google review.\n\nSingapore\n\nJobs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/3f3002d6a71923bf588ef09d8705deb832e1fe1bf39a672385aef0e7b0b70264?w=825", "alt_text": "Manimaran Guna has been working with Mobile Pet Cremation Services for the last seven years."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nSingaporean Magesh Das, known as a national bodybuilding champion and a top-ranked insurance agent, is boldly stepping into uncharted territory – Tamil cinema.\n\nOn July 18, his dream will hit the big screen in India, Singapore and Malaysia with the release of his debut Tamil film Chennai Files, in which he stars as a menacing antagonist.\n\nBorn and raised in Singapore, Magesh grew up watching Tamil action films, dreaming secretly of being part of that world. But, like many childhood ambitions, it was buried under the expectations of practical career choices.\n\n“When I was nine, my teacher asked what I wanted to be – I said an actor. She told me, ‘Don’t dream like that. Be an engineer or lawyer instead.’ So I buried it,” he recalls.\n\nYears rolled on. Magesh excelled in academics – with an engineering degree from Nanyang Technological University, carved out a 21-year career at Great Eastern insurance company, built the F17 football academy whose ambassador was Fandi Ahmad and even clinched the national bodybuilding championship title last year at age 46. But when Covid-19 lockdowns hit, an old spark reignited.\n\n“With so much time at home, I found myself watching films again – and I noticed Indian cinema had great heroes, but the villains had lost their edge. I thought: maybe my physique and passion could fill that gap,” he said.\n\nUnlike most dreamers, Magesh approached his passion strategically. For two years, he dissected how the Tamil film industry works – from production to promotion.\n\nHe then met Anish Ashraf, a former assistant to blockbuster director A.R. Murugadoss, who agreed to test Magesh’s screen presence.\n\nTogether, they made a short film, Blood, which won encouraging feedback online. It cemented Magesh’s belief that his idea wasn’t wishful thinking but a genuine business opportunity.\n\n“When Ashraf showed me his old thriller script, I knew this was my shot. I launched Sinnathamby Productions, named after my grandfather, and we got to work,” Magesh says.\n\nPre-production for Chennai Files began in early 2023. Filming kicked off in April and wrapped up in just 42 days across Chennai and Puducherry. The cast includes respected names like Vetri, Thambi Ramaiyah, Redin Kingsley and Shilpa Manjunath.\n\nBut the real challenge came post-production. The film industry hit a slump in 2024 – no distributors were ready to back a first-time producer with no big studio ties.\n\nUndeterred, Magesh decided to self-release. “This is a $700,000 personal investment. Yes, I could have bought a private property – but I didn’t want to be 80 and wonder ‘what if’. I’ll always earn back the money, but not the chance.”\n\nIn Chennai Files, Magesh’s character is no cartoonish villain. It’s a role demanding grit, nuance and physical presence – traits he’s honed over decades on bodybuilding stages and business negotiation tables.\n\n“I wanted to bring back the kind of memorable antagonist we saw in classics, someone who genuinely challenges the hero and drives the story forward,” he explains.\n\nDespite being a newcomer, he did his own stunts, trained under fight masters, and even broke a rib during an intense sequence. He also hired a Russian vocal coach and a personal acting tutor to ensure he delivers a performance worthy of the silver screen.\n\nFar from chasing fame alone, Magesh treats cinema as an extension of his business acumen. He has a clear plan: build Chennai Files into a franchise, take on select villain roles across South Indian cinema, and continue producing thrillers that combine high-octane plots with thought-provoking messages.\n\n“I’ve got four offers on my table, and ten bound scripts at home. But I’m waiting for this film’s release. The audience will tell me how they see me – and then I’ll choose wisely,” he says.\n\nMagesh, a single father of two boys – one of whom plays football in Spain – continues to juggle his insurance career with his newfound film journey.\n\n“I’m among the top 0.1 per cent agents in Singapore. Acting won’t change that. I plan my shoots carefully: 10 to 12 days on set, then I’m back to my clients and businesses,” he says matter-of-factly.\n\nLooking back, he credits his relentless discipline – the same that built his championship physique – for this latest pivot. “People think dreams and business are separate. For me, they feed each other. You need vision, guts and execution for both,” he says.\n\nWhen Chennai Files hits theatres in Singapore, Malaysia, and India on July 18, Magesh will be watching not as a bodybuilder, insurance veteran or corporate leader – but as a boy who once dared to defy his teacher’s words and write his own script.\n\n“I wanted to be an actor at nine. It took decades, but here I am. If my villain terrifies you, then I’ve done my job,” he says with a grin.\n\n“This is a $700,000 personal investment. Yes, I could have bought a private property – but I didn’t want to be 80 and wonder ‘what if’.”\n\nMagesh Das\n\nSingapore\n\nActor", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/2c501ede670798139ee5c441a72ccced3dcdb916137cc2735d841fcd07f5a297?w=825", "alt_text": "Magesh Das as the villain in Chennai Files."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nNivaan Khandhadia (right), a Grade 8 student from Global Indian International School (GIIS) SMART Campus, has achieved a remarkable milestone in the world of international chess.\n\nAt just 13 years old, the prodigy secured the prestigious Candidate Master (CM) title after a spectacular performance at the Dr Szalay Janos Memorial U2250 Open in Hungary this April.\n\nCompeting against seasoned international opponents, Nivaan finished first overall. Along the way, he defeated two International Masters (IM) and a FIDE Master (FM), showcasing the kind of composure and tactical prowess well beyond his years.\n\n“The CM title has been a big milestone for me,” said Nivaan. “It’s the result of nearly nine years of dedication and hard work.”\n\nNivaan’s tournament performance lifted his ELO rating to 2112, placing him among the highest-rated players in South-east Asia in his age group.\n\nGerman Grand Master Milan Pacher said: “Nivaan’s ability to calculate deep, stay calm under pressure and play with purpose at such a young age is rare. He doesn’t just play chess – he thinks like a Grand Master in the making.”\n\nIntroduced to chess at the age of four by his father Rathin Khandhadia in Pune, Nivaan showed early promise. By six, he was already India’s youngest-rated chess player.\n\nToday, he trains online under renowned coach Harsh Ganoje at The Chess Crew academy, dedicating three hours on school days and up to six hours on weekends to refining his game.\n\nHis list of achievements is long and impressive, including gold at the Singapore National U7 Championship and a bronze at the World School Chess Championship in Turkey at age seven.\n\nNivaan’s commitment to the sport is matched by his dedication to academics. He’s known for carrying textbooks to tournaments and revising between rounds. “He’s played five-hour matches and still makes time to revise his science chapters,” said Mr Rathin, who is also a director at GIIS and a licensed FIDE arbiter.\n\nAs Nivaan sets his sights on the next title – FIDE Master (FM) – his training now includes both on-the-board tactics and off-the-board preparation, such as stamina building, diet management and psychological endurance.\n\nHis father said: “Chess is as much a physical game as it is mental. He’s lost 10kg in the last five months and is following a strict diet to cope with the demands of high-level competition.”\n\nNivaan’s global chess calendar is being carefully curated. His upcoming plans include participating in top-tier tournaments across Europe – Amsterdam, Barcelona and Sweden – aimed at providing quality exposure without risking rating drops.\n\nDespite the challenges of balancing studies and elite sport, the Khandhadia family is committed to keeping Nivaan’s academic path intact.\n\n“We’re okay with a 10 percent academic dip as long as he never feels his passion was unsupported,” said Mr Rathin. “He used to be a school topper, now he’s in the top five. That’s good enough for us.”\n\nNivaan credits his success to a supportive environment at home and school. His mother accompanies him on tournament tours, ensuring he has proper vegetarian meals and a routine that keeps him grounded even in distant lands.\n\n“I love reading, playing football, swimming and tennis too,” said Nivaan. “But chess is different. The longer the game, the more I enjoy it.”\n\nChess\n\nSports", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cc42ea6b7dccc269c02781eab4d33f2ea9acbd11adf5a86138f140edf38f6906?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

No one makes movies like that. I love it.”\n\nThis revelation came when the Shape of You hitmaker responded to a fan who couldn’t believe he’d watched Aashiqui 2, the film that made him a die-hard fan of Indian singer Arijit Singh.\n\nSheeran’s admission quickly turned him into an honorary Indian, with amused netizens affectionately renaming him “Edwinder Singh”, “Ed Sharma” and even “Ed Shreeram”, reported The Mint. Many joked he deserves an Aadhaar (national identity) card for how deeply he connects with Indian culture.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer’s bond with India goes beyond movies. His latest hit, Sapphire, is a collaboration with none other than Arijit himself – the very singer Sheeran first discovered through the Aashiqui 2 Tum Hi Ho.\n\nTheir musical partnership has captivated millions, blending Sheeran’s signature sound with soulful Punjabi and Hindi lyrics, reported India Today.\n\nFans were even more thrilled when Bollywood royalty Shah Rukh Khan made a surprise cameo mouthing “Sapphire” in the music video, which has already clocked over 21 million views.\n\nIn behind-the-scenes glimpses shared by Ed on Instagram, he can be seen exploring Arijit’s hometown of Murshidabad in West Bengal on a scooter and an auto-rickshaw, soaking up local colours and warmth.\n\nIn his post, he reminisced about being “spellbound” by Arijit’s voice and revealed how a backstage jam session sparked the creation of Sapphire.\n\nMany Indian fans praised Sheeran’s genuine affection for Indian culture. One fan wrote: “Ed actually loves India – he even knows the difference between Bollywood and Tollywood!”\n\nOthers, however, remained sceptical, wondering if celebrities sometimes praise India purely for its massive market.\n\nFor now, the love appears mutual. With his heartfelt confessions, Indian nicknames and an Arijit collaboration that features a surprise Shah Rukh moment, “Edwinder Singh” has proven he’s more than just a visitor – he’s a fan at heart.

On June 12, while standing on the terrace of his father’s rented home near the airport, Aryan began filming planes passing overhead to show his friends back home.\n\nBut what he filmed instead was the terrifying final moments of the London-bound Boeing Dreamliner 787-8. Within seconds, the aircraft, which had climbed just 650 feet after takeoff, spiralled downwards and crashed into a medical hostel complex in Meghani Nagar, erupting into a fireball.\n\nAryan’s short, shaky video, showing the plane’s descent and the fiery explosion, quickly went viral, becoming the first visual confirmation of the accident for the public and a vital piece of evidence for investigators.\n\nRecalling the horror, Aryan told reporters: “I thought it was landing, but then it crashed. I felt very scared. My sister saw the video first. I can’t stop thinking about it.”\n\nThe impact on Aryan has been profound. According to his father Maganbhai Asari, the teen was so terrified that he couldn’t eat or sleep, and trembled each time he heard an aircraft overhead. He has since been sent back to his village to recover in a quieter environment.\n\n“My son is traumatised,” his father told The Hindustan Times. “He keeps saying he doesn’t want to be here anymore because it feels dangerous. Reporters kept coming to our door. He couldn’t speak properly.”\n\nThe Ahmedabad Crime Branch confirmed Aryan was not detained but was called in with his father to give a witness statement. They praised his cooperation, clarifying that no charges were brought against him for filming the video.\n\nAs civil aviation authorities continue to investigate why the plane lost altitude so quickly, Aryan’s accidental footage remains critical.

Within seconds, the aircraft issued a distress call and crashed into the BJ Medical College complex, claiming the lives of all 241 passengers and crew on board, as well as 29 people on the ground.\n\nMr Vishwas and Mr Ajay, both originally from Diu, had returned to India to visit family and were heading back to London when tragedy struck.\n\nFor days after the crash, Mr Vishwas was treated at Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital, while Mr Ajay’s remains were identified through DNA testing before being handed over to the family early on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn Bucharwada village, community head Dipak Devjibhai described the deeply emotional funeral.\n\n“The entire family arrived for the procession. They carried Ajay’s body from Patelwadi to Koli Samaj crematorium. Despite heavy rain, people came out to stand with Vishwas and his family. Fourteen other locals died in this crash – it has devastated our community,” he said.\n\nA heartbreaking video that quickly went viral shows Mr Vishwas, arm in a sling, face wrapped in gauze, shouldering his brother’s coffin alongside his weeping mother, draped in a blue sari.\n\nThe funeral took place under grey skies, with neighbours and relatives shielding the grieving family from the relentless rain.\n\nLittle is clear about how Mr Vishwas survived when no one else on board did. His seat, 11A, was close to an emergency exit on the left side of the plane.\n\nIn an interview with DD News, Mr Vishwas recounted how a twist of fate saved him: “The portion of the plane I was sitting in landed on the ground floor of the hostel. When I saw the door was broken, I knew I had to escape. I somehow walked out alive. Even now, I can’t believe it.”\n\nNew footage shows Mr Vishwas moments after the crash, dazed and limping away from the smouldering wreckage, guided by Mr Satinder Singh Sandhu, a supervisor with Ahmedabad’s emergency ambulance services.\n\nMr Sandhu told the BBC he was eating lunch when he saw massive flames and rushed to the site, not knowing he would rescue the only survivor.\n\n“When I reached the college, I saw chaos everywhere – screams, fire, bodies. Suddenly, I saw this man emerging from the wreckage in a torn white shirt, face burnt. He kept trying to go back inside. We had to drag him away for treatment. Only later did I realise he was the lone survivor,” Mr Sandhu recalled.\n\nFirst responders rushed Mr Vishwas to the hospital’s trauma centre, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited him the following day to check on his recovery.\n\nA day after being discharged, Mr Vishwas found himself at Mr Ajay’s funeral – a cruel reminder of how narrowly he escaped the same fate.\n\nThrough tears, he told local reporters: “I lost my brother beside me. I wish I could have saved him. I still feel like I should have done more.”\n\nExperts are still investigating the cause of the crash, which has become India’s deadliest aviation disaster in over a decade. Officials have retrieved the flight data and cockpit voice recorders – the black boxes – and hope they will shed light on what went wrong just seconds after take-off.\n\nPreliminary reports indicate that the pilot issued a “mayday” before the aircraft plunged into the medical college hostel.

I still remember how I felt when I first watched Padayappa. That feeling is my compass.”\n\nNearly a decade ago, Vindsanity was just a name scribbled in a college notebook at Republic Polytechnic — a vague dream sparked by hunger and ambition. Four years later, Arvind turned that dream into a full-time venture. Today, Vindsanity commands nearly 100,000 followers across social platforms like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nBut Vindsanity’s rise wasn’t fueled by resources. Despite studying business at Singapore Management University, Arvind’s heart was behind the camera. “People looked at me like, ‘You don’t even know how to use a camera.’ And they weren’t wrong. But I knew I could learn.”\n\nHis first encounter with cinema was an unexpected one. As a child, running up and down a staircase, he saw actor Kamal Haasan emerge from a car during a film promotion event. The actor paused, ruffled his hair, and said “hi.” “It was all of three seconds,” Arvind recalled. “But it was enough. That was cinema, touching me.”\n\nTwo years ago, fate brought him face-to-face with Kamal again, this time at an Indian 2 press event, now as a media peer. “I didn’t get to talk to him. But just being there was enough. That staircase kid had made it into the room.”\n\nIf Kamal lit the first spark, Rajinikanth cast the longer shadow. “He walks into a frame, and your spine straightens. I’ve been chasing that energy ever since.”\n\nThe name Vindsanity blends alias, brand, and philosophy. “It’s the madness that drives us. The belief that even in a small place, you can make something crazy,” he said.\n\nThat belief has been tested through dry months, ghosted collaborations and unpaid shoots. “You start with a camera you don’t own, doing shoots no one asked for. And you ask yourself, ‘Why am I doing this?’ The answer was always the same – because it’s who I am.”\n\nNow, the path has company. Vindsanity’s team has grown to six. “Everyone came in for the love of it first,” Arvind said. “The foundation was passion, and the skills followed.”\n\nVindsanity’s team of six.\n\nPhoto: Vindsanity\n\n“We’re also finally at a place where we can sustain ourselves through our work,” Arvind shared. “Clients reach out for marketing campaigns, social media content, branding videos, you name it. It took years, but we’re earning through the craft we love.”\n\nVindsanity’s social media portfolio features prominent clients, including 12 Cupcakes and Erode Amman Mess, as well as collaborations with Vasantham and MediaCorp, which help them reach younger audiences in Singapore and Malaysia. While exact figures remain undisclosed, Arvind said that 2024 was their most successful year yet, and they’re aiming to double that growth by the end of this year.\n\nFor Neshma Thamil, 25, who handles client partnerships, staying at Vindsanity after university was a no-brainer. “I get to work with my closest friends on projects that fuel my creativity. That kind of fulfilment? You can’t put a price on it.”\n\nIllustrator Abirahmi d/o Jaysankar, 25, sees Vindsanity as part of a cultural shift. “It’s exciting to be part of this wave of South Asian creators finally being recognised in Singapore. There’s a momentum that feels long overdue.”\n\nArvind said his aspiration now is to pay it forward. To inspire more Indians in Singapore and across the region to pursue media.\n\n“For too long, we’ve seen creativity as a side hustle. I want to show it doesn’t have to be.”\n\nIn his free time, Arvind buries himself in movies, YouTube tutorials on camera techniques, and filmmaking documentaries. He watches Rajinikanth’s speeches from film audio launches on repeat. “They inspire me,” he said. “One day, I want to be the director Rajini playfully teases onstage. That’s the dream.”\n\nIt sounds improbable, but so was building a media company with no team and no roadmap.\n\n“Sometimes I still feel like that kid on the staircase,” Arvind said. “Running, a little lost, a little excited, waiting for cinema to notice me again.”\n\nSingapore\n\nMedia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5938f2b4089c4e9d855fab01becdc462622a55bb3aa872a9d7b7b09dea3cde1b?w=825", "alt_text": "Arvind Kumar sat in front of Rajinikanth’s mural in his office."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nOn most days, Sathiyamoorthy Venkatesan is surrounded by incense smoke and sacred chants, performing age-old rituals at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple on Serangoon Road.\n\nBut on May 31, the 34-year-old assistant chief priest from Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, was seen in a different light – sprinting across the cricket field in full gear, eyes locked on the ball, leading his team, the Garuda Warriors, to a spirited victory.\n\nThe occasion was the Hindu Endowments Board’s (HEB) Inter-Temple Cricket Tournament, a first-of-its-kind initiative to bring together temple staff across Singapore in the name of sport, camaraderie and wellness.\n\nHeld at the Singapore Indian Association Field, the tournament saw teams from the four HEB-managed temples trade their panchagajams (worn by priests) for cricket colours and sacred chants for cheers of encouragement.\n\n“I’ve loved cricket since I was a child,” said Venkatesan with a wide grin, eyes lighting up at the memory of playing in the dusty lanes in Kumbakonam. “I’ve played in small tournaments back home, but this is my first time competing in Singapore. It feels amazing.\n\n“We are often busy with pujas, weddings and temple functions, especially on weekends. Weekdays give us some free time, and that’s when we practice – usually in the temple car park, even under the hot sun,” added Venkatesan, who has been in Singapore for four years.\n\nHis team, the Garuda Warriors, is made up of five priests, two administrative staff, a cook and a few helpers.\n\nTheir dedication paid off – they won the tournament, scoring 46 runs for nine wickets in eight overs in the final, beating the Sri Vairavimada Kaliamman Temple team, or Tiger Warriors, who managed 31 for 5 in eight overs.\n\n“Winning felt great. But more than that, it was about the joy of playing, the bonding and the break from routine,” said Venkatesan, who scored 24 and 2 in the two matches his team played. “We usually don’t get time to connect with each other beyond our duties. But this brought us together like family.”\n\nThe idea behind the tournament was simple yet powerful: to foster wellness, build bonds and offer temple staff a joyful break from their demanding routines.\n\n“This tournament is a celebration of those who serve silently behind the scenes,” said Professor N. Ganapathy, vice-chairman of HEB and chairman of the Temple Affairs Committee. “It’s not just about cricket – it’s about wellness, teamwork and joy.”\n\nThe matches were played in good spirit, with the staff showing the same discipline and teamwork on the pitch as they do in their temples. Teams representing Sri Mariamman Temple and Sri Sivan Temple also competed in the eight-over tennis-ball matches.\n\nFor Sreenarayanan, a 51-year-old priest and captain of the Sri Sivan Temple team, the experience was nostalgic. “I used to play regularly in my youth. This gave me a chance to reconnect with something I love,” he said. “Many of us are away from our families. But today, we felt like one big family.”\n\nHEB CEO Jeevaganth Arumugam emphasised the broader purpose behind the event. “At the end of the day, our priests and temple staff are human too. They need a space to relax, laugh and bond,” he said. “This was a way for them to enjoy themselves outside the temple, to reconnect with a part of themselves that may have been forgotten.”\n\nHEB provided full support, including cricket gear, branded jerseys and allocated time for practice. “Some of them trained hard on their own. It was inspiring to see their passion,” Mr Jeevaganth said.\n\nManikandan, administration manager and captain of the Sri Vairavimada Kaliamman Temple team, said cricket offered a welcome release from daily stress. “We face the public all day, handle rituals, logistics – it’s stressful. Playing cricket gave us joy and helped us bond,” he said.\n\nHis team, like the others, was made up of a cross-section of temple staff – priests, admin officers, cooks and helpers – truly reflecting the spirit of inclusivity.\n\nBeyond the cricket, the event offered a rare glimpse into the lives of temple staff. Many, like Venkatesan, live alone in Singapore. Their days are filled with religious duties, and social interactions are limited.\n\n“We don’t go out much. Sometimes we play badminton, sometimes we just rest. But this event was different. We laughed, trained, competed – and grew closer,” said Venkatesan.\n\nHe now hopes to continue playing cricket more regularly and dreams of setting up a weekly match among temple staff.\n\nThe event was so well-received that HEB plans to make it an annual affair. “Based on the enthusiasm we’ve seen, there’s no question – we’ll continue this,” said Mr Jeevaganth. “It might take different forms, but the message is the same: we care for our staff, and we want to give them opportunities to thrive.”\n\nFor Venkatesan, the day was more than just a win. “It brought back memories, gave me joy and reminded me that even as priests, we can have fun, we can play and we can dream,” he said.\n\nSathiyamoorthy Venkatesan (centre) with the other priests from his Garuda Warriors team, who won the tournament.\n\nPhoto: Sundara Nataraaj\n\n“It brought back memories, gave me joy and reminded me that even as priests, we can have fun, we can play, and we can dream.”\n\nAssistant chief priest Sathiyamoorthy Venkatesan\n\nSports\n\nCommunity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4c62227d4a2f997e164a22abf279a64f114a1ab1e82d33d5a7326c2cc298c180?w=825", "alt_text": "Sathiyamoorthy Venkatesan in priestly dress at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple; (right) playing in the Inter-Temple Cricket Tournament organised by the Hindu Endowments Board."}]}

He came chasing dreams, not causing harm. As an NRI, I felt helpless and heartbroken. This is a human tragedy.”\n\nThe video quickly gained traction online, drawing a wave of sympathy and anger, reported NDTV.\n\nIn response, the Indian Consulate in New York issued a statement confirming they were in touch with US authorities and monitoring the case. “The individual, who is from Haryana, entered the US without a valid visa and is being deported in accordance with a court order,” a source familiar with the case told India Today.\n\nAuthorities further stated that during his transit through Newark, the youth’s “behaviour was found not conducive to travel”, prompting airport security to intervene.\n\nHe was subsequently admitted to a medical facility and will be deported to India once declared fit for travel.\n\nThe US embassy in New Delhi weighed in on the controversy with a firm message.\n\nIt reiterated that, while the US welcomes legitimate travellers, it has a zero-tolerance policy towards illegal entry and visa abuse.\n\nThe incident comes amid heightened enforcement of immigration laws under President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nUS authorities have ramped up deportations and border control, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to enter or remain in the country without proper documentation.\n\nThe case has also led to concerns about a broader trend.\n\nMr Jain suggested that several Indian nationals may be facing similar treatment at US airports. “Every day, three-four such cases are happening. These children get their visas, board a flight and are sent back in the evening, tied up like criminals,” he posted.\n\nAdding to the concern, investigators found that the detained individual was questioned for five to six hours, but reportedly could not provide adequate responses during his immigration interview.\n\nOne observer noted that a Hindi-speaking officer was called in to communicate with him, but the youth’s answers failed to satisfy authorities.\n\nDespite the serious breach of immigration laws, many are now questioning the methods employed by law enforcement.\n\n“There are protocols for such situations,” said a legal analyst. “Restraint should be used proportionally, and basic dignity must be preserved, especially when dealing with non-violent individuals.”\n\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs has yet to release a formal statement, but sources indicate that consular officials are actively engaged with their American counterparts to ensure due process and humane treatment for the individual.\n\nIndia\n\nNewark\n\nUnited States", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/bf3bb6bbbcaa486ef52f73c4414be85e24d59dccc054d6af101e12f3c963e68e?w=825", "alt_text": "The Indian youth being handcuffed at Newark Liberty International Airport."}]}

His wife Sonam, police say, conspired with her lover, Raj Kushwaha, to have him killed.\n\nThe couple checked out of their homestay on May 23 for a day of sightseeing but never returned. Their rented scooter was found abandoned the next day, prompting a police search.\n\nDays of heavy rain hampered efforts until the discovery of Mr Raja’s body in a gorge nearly a week later. The body was unrecognisable, but a tattoo bearing his name helped confirm his identity.\n\nWhile the killers had left few traces, investigators stumbled upon a machete – a weapon uncommon in Meghalaya. That anomaly raised suspicions and led police to dig deeper. When call records showed Sonam’s contact with a known associate just before the murder, the investigation gained momentum.\n\nFrom there, everything began to fall apart.\n\nPolice say Kushwaha plotted the murder days after Sonam’s wedding. He allegedly hired three contract killers – Vishal Chauhan, Anand Kumar and Akash Rajput – offering them Rs20 lakh ($300,000) for the job.\n\nThe killers posed as tourists, accompanied the couple and killed Mr Raja on Sonam’s instructions.\n\nSonam went missing after the crime but was tracked down in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, after asking a foodstall worker for a phone. Arrested and flown to Shillong, she is now in police custody.\n\nThe killers were apprehended across Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Investigators gathered a mountain of evidence: blood-stained clothes, Mr Raja’s belongings, CCTV footage from over 40 locations and matching travel records.\n\nDespite the strong case, Sonam’s mobile phone – which may contain damning messages and calls – is still missing. The Rs20 lakh payment trail remains partly untraced, and investigators are working to map the post-murder escape routes of the accused.\n\nMeghalaya Superintendent of Police Vivek Syiem, who leads the case, confirmed that Sonam and Kushwaha face charges of criminal conspiracy and murder. “The physical and digital evidence overwhelmingly points to a planned killing,” he said.\n\nIndia\n\nCrime\n\nMurder", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/549f84153e316324337ff13f1772a79e6120b739dee714a74fae1fdf15ca7d27?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Raja Raghuvanshi (far left), Sonam and her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha."}]}

His mother is best known for directing Monsoon Wedding and The Namesake. His father is a Marxist scholar.\n\nBefore entering politics, Mr Zohran worked as a housing counsellor. He won a seat in the New York State Assembly representing Queens’ 36th District in 2020, running as a Democratic Socialist. Re-elected twice, he built a reputation as a champion of tenant rights, public transport access and economic justice.\n\nMr Zohran’s mayoral campaign – announced in October 2024 after federal investigations into incumbent Mayor Eric Adams – has taken the city by storm with its unique flair.\n\nIn one viral campaign video, he rewrites a famous Deewar scene. Amitabh Bachchan’s iconic line “Aaj mere paas buildingein hain, property hai…” is interrupted. The screen cuts to Mr Zohran in Shah Rukh Khan’s signature pose: arms wide open, declaring: “Aap” – I have the people.\n\nThe music is Deewangi Deewangi from Om Shanti Om, while Kishore Kumar’s voice from Karz explains ranked-choice voting. Lassi, the humble Indian drink, stars in a light-hearted analogy. This is not your average political ad. It’s a cultural statement – and a rallying cry.\n\nHis message is simple: Billionaires already have everything. It’s time for working-class New Yorkers to have their moment.\n\nIf elected, Mr Zohran would become the city’s first Muslim and Indian-origin mayor, reported the Hindustan Times. He is running on a bold platform: free bus rides, city-run grocery stores, rent freezes and a US$30 minimum wage by 2030.\n\nHe supports taxing the wealthy to fund social programmes – an idea that has sparked backlash from business leaders. But it’s also won him a loyal following among young voters, immigrants and progressive activists. His campaign boasts over 20,000 volunteers canvassing across boroughs.\n\nRecently, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him, calling him the “strongest candidate to lead a coalition of working-class New Yorkers”. The endorsement could prove pivotal, giving Mr Zohran a significant edge with younger and left-leaning voters.\n\nMr Zohran’s main rival is Mr Andrew Cuomo, the former governor making a controversial return to public life. Polls show Mr Cuomo narrowly leading in first-choice rankings, but Mr Zohran is closing in, especially due to the ranked-choice voting system used in the June 24 Democratic primary.\n\nIn a recent debate, Mr Zohran pulled no punches, calling Mr Cuomo “corrupt” and himself “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare – a progressive, Muslim immigrant.” His bluntness has energised supporters and rattled political opponents.\n\nHowever, Mr Zohran’s rise has not been without controversy. His outspoken support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza and vow to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he enters NYC have drawn sharp criticism from pro-Israel groups and Jewish voters.\n\nIndian-American leaders have also raised concerns. After Mr Zohran said he would not attend a Modi rally, New York State Assembly member Jenifer Rajkumar responded: “Hindu voters want our leaders to build bridges, not burn them.” Human rights lawyer Jaspreet Singh accused Mr Zohran of pitting Hindus and Muslims against each other.\n\nAdding to the tension, far-right activist Laura Loomer took to social media warning: “Get ready for another 9/11,” calling Mr Zohran a “pro-Hamas Muslim socialist”. Her remarks were widely condemned as Islamophobic.\n\nDespite the polarising commentary, Mr Zohran’s campaign is resonating. His ability to blend culture and politics – using Bollywood, Hinglish and humour – has helped him connect with diverse communities.\n\nMore than 350,000 Muslim voters are registered in NYC, and Mr Zohran is actively courting this base. “This June 24, we can tell the world that Muslims don’t just belong in New York City. We belong in City Hall,” he said at a recent rally.\n\nYet, analysts caution that Mr Zohran needs to expand beyond his progressive base to secure a win. “A third of New Yorkers still haven’t heard of us,” he admitted. “That’s actually a good thing – it means we have room to grow.”\n\nIndian\n\nPolitics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/90a97ee7c61faabda1221a227fdf1de6dc465128b0fcce9053e1b127b39169c5?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Zohran Mamdani (right) with his parents Mahmood Mamdani and Mira Nair."}]}

Before winning MasterChef Singapore in 2023 and before his name appeared in glossy reviews, he was a boy working alongside his father in the kitchens of their local gurdwara, Sri Guru Singh Sabha.\n\nThese communal spaces, where food is both sustenance and spiritual offering, taught Inderpal lessons that no culinary school could – the value of collective effort, the importance of cooking for others and working in harmony to serve a larger purpose.\n\n“The kitchen was a place where people came together,” he reflected. “It wasn’t about perfect recipes, it was about feeding a community.”\n\nIt was during the global upheaval of the Covid-19 pandemic that Inderpal’s solitary cooking journey began. As Singapore locked down, he found himself isolated in his own kitchen, with a few days of leave to clear from his day job where he was managing a resource centre for foreign domestic workers. During that brief window, he began what would become a home-based business called Mr Singh Eats.\n\nStarting with just two staples, butter chicken and chapati, Inderpal gradually expanded his offerings, eventually handling every aspect of the operation himself – prepping, cooking, and delivery. At one point, his home-based menu boasted 46 dishes.\n\n“I remember I was cooking 14 kilos of butter chicken, eight kilos of daal, half a kilo of bhindi (okra) in one day,” he said.\n\nThrough this chaotic period, it was not just Inderpal who bore the weight of his labour of love. His wife, Sandhya Deep Kaur, 34, stood steadfastly by his side.\n\n“I contributed to the marketing efforts, streamlined orders into an excel sheet and helped pack and deliver the food with Inderpal,” she said.\n\nIt was chaotic but also very exciting, so I was very vested in Mr Singh Eats. Focusing on pushing out authentic food in a timely fashion truly allowed me to keep grounded.” Their shared resolve was the backbone of those early days.\n\nAfter a year of working on his home-based business, Inderpal went on to work at acclaimed restaurants like Thevar and Michelin-starred Burnt Ends, where he refined his skills under some of the industry’s top mentors.\n\nChef Inderpal plating dishes before service at Meh’r.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\n“Those kitchens changed everything for me,” Inderpal said. “The discipline, the technique, the pressure – I soaked it all in.” Then came the opportunity of a lifetime – MasterChef Singapore. The timing, though, was hardly ideal.\n\nRaising a child during Inderpal’s intense run on MasterChef Singapore posed its own challenges. “My daughter was in her infancy stage when Inderpal was shooting for MasterChef,” said Sandhya.\n\n“It was a very trying time to not have him around as much as I wanted to, simply because I had to juggle breastfeeding, watching the baby and healing from the C-section,” she recalled.\n\nYet the couple’s guiding principle was clear.\n\n“Our mantra since we started dating was that we will never stand in each other’s way when it comes to pursuing our careers and dreams, but instead, always providing whatever support is required,” said Sandhya.\n\nThat unwavering familial support, coupled with Inderpal’s relentless passion, propelled him through the competition, culminating in his victory in Season 4. Now, with Meh’r, his story comes full circle.\n\nBehind every dish lies a deeper story – of family, resilience, and the simple but profound act of cooking with heart. Some standout items from Meh’r’s menu include the mouth-watering Bak Bak Wings, Chilli Lobster Roti John, Tom Kha Ceviche and Sandhya’s Rojak, which Inderpal named after his wife.\n\nTo aspiring chefs, Inderpal offered a powerful word of advice: “The industry offers some high highs and low lows. If you love the craft, start wherever you are and never forget who’s been in your corner from day one.”\n\nCommunity\n\nChef\n\nRestaurant", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/4fe61b11aa08e66e40661f8c9b8f9c6f82eca4ec404d23d6711bfd5a57b07609?w=825", "alt_text": "Chef Inderpal Singh with his Masterchef trophy."}]}

Kavi\n\nMore than 20,000 devotees witnessed the consecration of the Sri Sivan Temple on June 8.\n\nThe Geylang East temple, one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore, has a history that dates back to the 1800s.\n\nThe event was attended by Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs K. Shanmugam.\n\nSpeaking to the media on the sidelines of the event, the ceremony’s guest of honour said: “Today’s consecration ceremony is very significant. This temple itself has a very special place in the heart of the Hindu community in Singapore.”\n\nMr Shanmugam unveiled a plaque commemorating the consecration ceremony.\n\nDevotees began streaming into purpose-built tents outside the temple from 7am, waiting eagerly for the main event – a Maha Kumbhabishegam (grand consecration in Sanskrit).\n\nIt refers to the process of pouring sanctified water from vessels on the roof of the temple.\n\nFrom around 7.30am, chants and traditional music filled the air as a procession of priests holding pots of sacred water, known as kumbhams, headed to the roof of the temple.\n\nThousands of devotees followed the elaborate proceedings via large screens showing a multi-camera live stream of the priests pouring purified water, which cascaded from 22 golden “kalasams” or pinnacles at the peak of the temple structure.\n\nMadam Navamany Gopalkrishnan, 68, was among the faithful who managed to get seats for the grand occasion two weeks ago.\n\n“If I am in the country, I never miss a temple’s consecration… and this is the biggest one I have been to,” said the retired caterer.\n\nHowever, the over-eager crowd at times threatened to break through barricades that had been set up to control people entering the temple after the main ceremony ended.\n\nAt around 11.30am, at one of the tents, part of the crowd bulged out of barricades as organisers and volunteers implored in Tamil for people to stop pushing.\n\nThe crowd, which had been waiting to enter the sanctum to pray, dissipated after the police were called to the site at Geylang East Avenue 2.\n\nTwo young children were pulled out from the crowd and given seats and water by volunteers, while a medic was seen attending to a man.\n\nAmong those stuck in the queue was Madam Kumari Muthu, 63, a nurse who had been at the site from 5.30am.\n\n“The pushing was terrible… I have never experienced anything like this before,” she said.\n\n“I was so afraid they were going to push all the old people; next time, there should be separate queues for men and women, the elderly and children.”\n\nThe crowd let up once the police arrived at around noon, and dispersed within 45 minutes.\n\nThe Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) said it was alerted to an incident at the consecration ceremony “which arose from a sudden surge in a particular section of the crowd waiting to enter the temple for prayers”.\n\nHEB said assistance was rendered to a few who required it, but no injuries were reported.\n\nMore volunteers were deployed, and it “subsequently sought the assistance of the police to quickly bring the situation under control”.\n\nThe statement added: “HEB takes this matter seriously and is reviewing the incident thoroughly... HEB will draw on the lessons from this experience to strengthen our preparations for future large-scale events, ensuring the safety and well-being of all devotees.”\n\nThis was the third such consecration for the temple, which started on a parcel of land in Orchard Road in 1868, then relocated to temporary premises in 1983, before moving to its current location in Geylang East in 1993.\n\nFollowing the consecration, the temple will hold 48 days of prayers, rituals and cultural programmes from June 9 to July 26.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nCommunity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/61ef20b8203b4aeb227ba388fce8a24b634a1a8a5cbea55bab32ff280a8ebbb3?w=825", "alt_text": "Chief priest Siva Sri Manisekaran Gurukkal showing the divine light during the consecration ceremonies."}]}

While she and her mother were born and brought up in Singapore, her maternal grandmother was born in East Timor and her father hails from Mayavaram in Tamil Nadu.\n\n“My family would regularly cook dishes like kicap fish (fish in soya sauce), assam pedas (traditional Malay fish stew), bee hoon biryani and kangkong thani saar (kangkong in coconut milk and dried prawns),” she added.\n\nWith 40 years of experience teaching cooking, Chef Devagi, 70, has observed how Singaporean Tamil dishes have evolved over time. She said: “Through this food festival, I wanted to showcase the real ways that Singaporeans ate back then and now.”\n\nA crucial aspect of Ayalagam was Chef Devagi’s familiarity with Tamil Nadu’s own cuisines, due to her research for her cookbooks over the years. “Every region in Tamil Nadu has its own style of cooking, and it is different from Singapore’s,” she said.\n\n“Sometimes when we make our fish curry, we add ingredients like lemongrass, borrowing elements from the Malay fish stew assam pedas. We also add ladies’ fingers, unlike Tamil Nadu.\n\n“For biryani, we use pandan leaves for aroma, and we tend to cook the chicken and rice separately before layering and cooking in dum, whereas in Chennai, the chicken and rice are all cooked together. Tofu sambal and kicap fish are also our specialty cuisines. We can stir-fry tofu Chinese-style, make sambal Malay-style or add masala Indian-style.”\n\nFor desserts, while many South Indian restaurants generally offer the likes of gulab jamun, at Ayalagam, Chef Devagi offered a creative blend of South-east Asian delights including tapioca halwa, pandan putu mayam with banana and gula melaka sauce, as well as a coconut-based chendol-like dessert.\n\nRemarkably, these dishes were prepared not by Singaporean or Malaysian chefs but rather by a team of young Indian chefs at Sangamithirai whom Chef Devagi painstakingly taught how to cook the South-east Asian way.\n\nSangamithirai’s Executive Chef Narayanamurthi Veerasamy, himself an avid researcher of Tamil Literature and food, was delighted to hear of Chef Devagi’s longtime wish to cook Tamil cuisine in a restaurant when she visited Sangamithirai last December, during a research trip.\n\nHe contacted her in March and the preparation for Ayalagam began. He said: “We tested the menu items beforehand. I particularly liked the Tamil version of her nasi lemak with prawn sambal. Many people were very surprised with the way it was packaged in banana leaf.”\n\nAdded Chef Devagi: “It was heartwarming to see people in Tamil Nadu appreciating the unique flavours of Singaporean Tamil cuisine.”\n\nChef\n\nCommunity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/955359253720311b165c2cee5fcc20044adaa7a83d9ae7d34cd2c69683b26053?w=825", "alt_text": "Chef Devagi Sanmugam with the dishes she prepared for Ayalagam."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nRenowned author and motivational speaker Shiv Khera launched his latest book, Live While You’re Alive: Take a Break Before You Break Down, at a glittering event on May 31 at the Singapore Swimming Club.\n\nThe occasion, graced by India’s High Commissioner to Singapore  Shilpak Ambule, drew an audience of 450 business leaders, educators and professionals.\n\nThe new book dives into one of the most pervasive and under-discussed challenges of our time – stress.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Khera emphasised: “This is not just a book about success, but about survival. Stress, when left unchecked, impacts our health, our wealth and our relationships. This book helps you turn stress into strength.”\n\nWhat sets this book apart, he noted, is its unconventional approach. While many stress-management books focus on meditation, yoga or breathing techniques, Mr Khera believes those methods are ineffective without the right mental foundation.\n\n“Attitude is everything,” he stressed. “Without the right mindset, even the best techniques fail. You can’t meditate if your thoughts are in chaos.”\n\nThe decision to write about stress now, Mr Khera explained, stemmed from the overwhelming rise in stress-related breakdowns across the globe.\n\n“In the last two decades, stress levels have gone up by over 400 per cent. Families are crumbling, relationships are strained, and even medical issues are often rooted in unresolved stress,” he said.\n\nIn his view, stress is both natural and unavoidable – it can’t be outsourced, but it can be managed. The key lies in learning to differentiate between things we can change and things we must accept. “The serenity prayer says it best – accept what you cannot change, change what you can, and know the difference,” he said.\n\nMr Khera illustrated how internal attitudes, more than external circumstances, determine how we experience stress. “Two people stuck in traffic have very different experiences. One fumes and worsens his stress, while another listens to a motivational podcast and turns the moment into growth,” he said.\n\nThe book provides practical, attitude-based strategies for not just coping but thriving, encouraging readers to shift from reactive living to proactive growth. “Stress is only harmful when it becomes chronic. It can be a trigger for performance if managed wisely,” he added.\n\nBeyond the book, Mr. Khera revealed ambitious plans to launch a new leadership academy in Singapore – an initiative aimed at developing people-centric, value-driven leaders.\n\n“Our goal is to offer a four-day High Impact Leadership Programme that tackles four key dimensions: attitude, leadership, motivation and values,” Mr Khera said.\n\nThis programme is part of a larger global digital rollout aimed at reaching individuals and organisations worldwide. But Singapore, he stressed, will be the launchpad.\n\n“Singapore’s unique mix of economic stability and multicultural society makes it the perfect base for rolling out high-impact training,” explained Mr Khera, a Singapore permanent resident.\n\nLive While You’re Alive is now available at major bookshops and online platforms, and the leadership academy’s first sessions are expected to begin later this year.\n\nFor more details, visit shivkhera.com.\n\n“This is not just a book about success, but about survival.

This was the sight and sounds people encountered when they stepped into the Indian Heritage Centre on May 25.\n\nThe energetic display was part of a Bihu dance workshop that hosted about 50 participants, including children and adults.\n\nOriginating from the indigenous landscapes of Assam, Bihu is one of the many folk dances of Assamese culture that is particularly famous for its jaunty, bold gestures.\n\nThe workshop was organised by non-profit arts organisation Anandha Traditional Arts and Music – or better known as Atam SG – as the fourth installation of its Nam Marabu series.\n\n“The goal of Atam SG is to foster cultural consciousness,” said Lionel Heeren, 29, who leads the Nam Marabu initiative.\n\n“By bringing unique Indian folk art forms from around the world to Singapore, we are able to spark greater interest and enthusiasm, as well as encourage deeper understanding and knowledge about the Indian diaspora.”\n\nAimed at fostering awareness and appreciation of traditional Indian folk arts, the Nam Marabu series has conducted workshops on Sakkai Kuchi, a dynamic dance with handheld sticks, Thevarattam, also known as the “dance of the gods”, and Thudumbattam, an energetic form performed to the beat of the thudumbu drum.\n\nTo further enrich the cultural experience and ensure authenticity, the Bihu workshop was conducted in collaboration with the Singapore Assamese Association, which brought in 10 performers to support and guide the participants.\n\nRenowned Assamese dancer and choreographer Jasmine Sethia Bukhan, 38, led the workshop. Her seasoned movements were accompanied by rhythmic beats from acclaimed dhol artiste Manob Gogoi.\n\nWith over 15 years of experience teaching Bihu at NPS International School in Guwahati, Assam, Jasmine shared that her passion for the dance form began with her mother – her first guru.\n\n“It was a special experience to teach this dance to people of various age groups and tailor it to their individual abilities,” she said. “Imparting knowledge about our culture in such an inclusive setting was truly refreshing.”\n\nFor eight-year-old Moira, a young Assamese girl born and raised in Singapore, the workshop offered a personal connection to her heritage – especially as she has never visited Assam.\n\n“I’m happy I got to learn the Bihu dance, which represents my culture,” she said with pride.\n\nAtam SG also conducted a Bihu dance masterclass from May  21 to 24, designed specifically for experienced dancers and practitioners to explore the art form in greater depth.\n\nThe enthusiastic turnout for both the masterclass and the public workshop took the organisers by surprise, said vice-president of the Singapore Assamese Association Atreyee Barthakur.\n\n“What made this collaboration even more heartening was the number of non-Assamese participants – people from different cultural backgrounds – who joined these sessions.\n\n“Despite their personal commitments, they chose to devote time to learning an unfamiliar art form from scratch. That level of dedication is truly commendable.”\n\nCommunity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f6a8cb3c12f0be92e9ea93972cc6c327de04a053955d1d9fa3ec77549c2e1af5?w=825", "alt_text": "The Bihu dance session being led by dancer Jasmine Sethia Bukhan and dhol player Manob Gogoi."}]}

The film is available to stream on Netflix in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi.\n\nDangal\n\nThe biographical sports drama is based on the true story of Indian amateur wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, who channels his unfulfilled dream of winning a gold medal into training his two daughters to compete at the Commonwealth Games.\n\nAamir Khan delivers a grounded performance as the doggedly determined father who, despite initial disappointment at not having a son, recognises his two older daughters’ potential when they return home after beating up some boys in response to derogatory comments.\n\nThe 2016 Hindi film is peppered with poignant father-daughter moments that evidently struck a chord with the global audience. Dangal, which refers to a wrestling arena, is currently the highest-grossing Indian film of all time – thanks in large part to a massively successful 2017 theatrical run in China. It earned an impressive worldwide total of US$311 million ($419.85 million).\n\nPop Culture\n\nFather's Day\n\nBollywood\n\nTollywood", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d345774bab419363307b6b38830d1d8b312ac7cf9e3709d8ea2d0e137beb0f88?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Welcome to your new life.\n\nYou may have survived Delhi’s traffic, Mumbai’s monsoons or Bengaluru’s disappearing footpaths, but are you ready to go full Singaporean?\n\nHere’s a handy guide to ease your transition:\n\nUnderstanding Singlish\n\nSinglish is kind of the Hinglish of Singapore. It’s universally spoken (Singapore being the universe) but incomprehensible to anyone outside the tribe.\n\nIt’s not English, not Chinese, not Malay – just a uniquely Singaporean blend where everything ends with lah, lor or meh.\n\nAt first, you’ll nod politely while having no idea what’s going on: Hawker aunty: “Can, can. Eat here or tapao, lah?” You: “Uh... yes?”\n\nEventually, you’ll get the hang of it. You’ll start saying “can” instead of “yes,” “lah” at the end of everything, and even ask your mother on WhatsApp: “Done your dinner or not, lah?” She’ll reply: “Aarey Wah! You already speak Chinese!”\n\nThe sari v the sweat\n\nYou brought 20 silk saris, two lehengas, one sherwani for your spouse, and a suitcase full of FabIndia kurtas. Three weeks in, and you’re wearing Uniqlo dry-fit shorts and flip-flops like everyone else.\n\nBecause Singapore, my friend, is humid.\n\nThat crisp cotton kurta you brought from Lucknow? It now resembles a limp tissue by lunchtime. And don’t even talk about makeup – it slides off faster than the MRT doors shut.\n\nStill, you wear your sari proudly to Deepavali events... only to be told by a Singaporean Tamil aunty: “Wah, you wear so traditional ah? Nowadays we all wear pants, lah!” You smile, trying not to pass out from heatstroke.\n\nThe clash of cultures\n\nAh yes. Here comes the tension no one talks about. You, with your Netflix Hindi-accented English and Karan Johar emotions, meet the Singaporean Indian who has lived here for generations and thinks your Bollywood melodrama is a bit much lah.\n\nYou: “I feel the spiritual energy of Little India, so vibrant, so soulful.” Singaporean Indian friend: “Vibrant? You mean noisy ah? Every weekend no parking. And the smell of incense stays in my hair until Tuesday.”\n\nThey think you haggle too much. You think they’ve forgotten the art of bargaining. They’re baffled you don’t eat pork or beef. You’re baffled they put fish head in curry. One North Indian NRI was even found staring at chicken rice in horror: “Where’s the masala?”\n\nBut, after a few awkward Deepavali gatherings and potluck misunderstandings, you’ll find a beautiful friendship.\n\nYou’ll laugh over Milo Dinosaurs and discuss who has better butter chicken: Delhi or Dunlop Street.\n\nTreasure hunts, trolley drama\n\nYou don’t need to worry about finding Indian groceries in Singapore, the shops are tucked around everywhere!\n\nYou’ll hear tales of Mustafa Centre – a 24-hour labyrinth of everything from gold jewellery to gobi.\n\nYou’ll go in to buy atta and come out six hours later with a suitcase, a pressure cooker, three phone chargers, and no memory of how you got there.\n\nThen there’s Tekka Market, where the uncles will size you up, guess your community and recommend chillies accordingly: “Gujarati ah? Take this mild one. North Indian? This one will wake your ancestors.”\n\nHawker Food v Home Food\n\nYour stomach wants thosais and vadais. Your new colleagues want you to try laksa, carrot cake (which is neither carrot nor cake) and sambal stingray. You politely try everything and then run home for curd rice.\n\nYour Singaporean Indian friend turns up with bee hoon and says: “Try, try. My grandma’s recipe!” You eat it, smile, and wonder whether it’s dessert, breakfast or both.\n\nEventually, you find your rhythm. You eat chicken rice for lunch, dal chawal for dinner and ice kacang when no one’s looking.\n\nFamily holidays and tiffin boxes\n\nNow that you are here, Singapore is a holiday destination for your family, your family’s family and your family’s family’s friends!\n\nYou plan a three-day trip to Sentosa with your in-laws, which turns into a five-day retreat with three tiffin boxes, one complaint about the aircon and several arguments about whether the Merlion is worth it.\n\nThe Indian in you endures it. The Singaporean in you wants to lock them all up in the Sentosa Surrender Chamber and throw away the key.\n\nWhat you really learn\n\nYou learn that adaptation is not about giving up who you are but just tweaking the recipe. You can speak Hinglish and Singlish. You can laugh at the fact that your Chinese neighbour puts durian in the fridge next to your rasgullas – and now everything smells... confusing.\n\nBut, most of all, you learn that home isn’t just where you were born. It’s where you learn to laugh at yourself in a new language, eat with your hands even if people stare, and help newbies find hing (asafoetida) on a desperate Tuesday night.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f63f2eaf320034500bc92e0f0c8add8dcec24be6c8fe579d7c217ce96f7faa77?w=825", "alt_text": "Shoppers at Mustafa Centre."}]}

Only later did he realise the virality of that spontaneous moment when it trended on social media.\n\n“I didn’t want people to think I was rallying only Vijay fans so I decided to neutralise it by making some references to Ajith movies in my rally speech,” he explained.\n\nGood Bad Ugly, Citizen, Viswasam and Vidaamuyarchi – titles of Ajith’s movies – were strategically woven into Dr Hamid’s Tamil speech during the PAP’s rally at Jurong West Stadium on April 27.\n\nWhen asked which actor he is a bigger fan of, he astutely replied: “Sensitive question. I enjoy both actors’ movies.\n\n“And I hope to move on from this,” he added, slightly bashful about the online attention his campaign speeches attracted.\n\nHowever, the added attention helped to cast a spotlight on causes Dr Hamid, 40, is passionate about such as health literacy, migrant worker healthcare and greater support for “no buffer” households.\n\nHealth literacy is the ability to understand and use health information to make informed decisions about one’s well-being. “We have a world-class health system, but some people aren’t using it properly,” he said.\n\nResidents tend to fall on two ends of the spectrum. Some neglect their health and dismiss serious conditions like high blood pressure, while others overuse healthcare services, seeking medical attention for issues that could be self-managed, Dr Hamid observed.\n\n“Its ongoing work where with every engagement we try to educate residents,” he said.\n\nLikewise, migrant workers tend to have poor health literacy due to language barriers. “On a monthly basis, we visit dormitories with migrant workers who volunteer to do the translations.\n\nDr Hamid Razak speaking to a migrant worker at Block 729 in Clementi.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\n“They speak Bengali, Mandarin, Tamil and Hindi so they talk to us doctors who clarify their doubts and then refer them to the primary care doctors to look after the workers.”\n\nAnother overlooked group Dr Hamid focuses on is lower-middle income or “no buffer” households – families who manage to get by financially, but could face serious trouble in the event of a setback like job loss or a critical illness.\n\nEarly identification of such households, improving health literacy among elderly family members and encouraging breadwinners to upskill to earn better incomes are some ways to prevent financial crises.\n\nHouse visits are essential to these efforts and are also how Dr Hamid’s political journey began.\n\nHe was asked to join the grassroots movement during a house visit by an MP in 2007, when he was a medical student living with his parents in Taman Jurong.\n\n“I just gave my details and I got a call two weeks later from the volunteers. From then on, I was exposed to the community, volunteerism and more,” he said.\n\nKnocking on doors and talking to residents gives him a good understanding of their underlying problems. “If we are taking a reactive approach, we will just be solving problems and not preventing problems. We have to be proactive.”\n\nHis approach to community service is shaped by his medical background, a path he pursued, inspired by a childhood fascination with biology and how the body works.\n\n“There was no family pressure, but my grandfather would always tell me in passing that he would love for someone in his family to be a doctor. That was probably on my subconscious mind,” said Dr Hamid, who works in private practice.\n\nAfter studying at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and Raffles Junior College, he went on to study medicine at the National University of Singapore.\n\nHe considered specialising in cardiology but eventually chose orthopaedic surgery for its engineering-based, problem-solving approach and its focus on sports injuries – a natural fit for a recreational footballer and ardent Liverpool fan like Dr Hamid.\n\n“Whenever we have community sports fiestas where football is featured, I will always volunteer to kick around,” he said.\n\nDr Hamid may have gone viral in the reel world, but in the real world, it’s his proactive, door-to-door commitment in the heartland that truly defines him.\n\n“If we are taking a reactive approach, we will just be solving problems and not preventing problems. We have to be proactive.”\n\nDr Hamid Razak\n\nJurong boy at heart\n\nDr Hamid has a strong rapport with the residents in his constituency as he has been a Jurong resident for the past 30 years.\n\nHe had his fair share of fun as a child, playing football with his neighbourhood friends in the court next to Rulang Primary School in Jurong West, using the rooms in Taman Jurong Community Centre to study and hanging out at Jurong Entertainment Centre, which has since closed down.\n\n“It used to have a Shaw Cinema, a bowling alley and a Long John Silver’s, so my secondary schoolmates and I used to eat at Long John Silver’s after school, then go bowling and occasionally catch a movie there.\n\n“I still keep in touch with my friends and, when we meet up every year, we always eat at Long John Silver’s for old times’ sake. We know each of our orders. Mine is the two piece chicken with extra crumbs, emphasis on the extra crumbs of course,” Dr Hamid quipped.\n\nDr Hamid Razak with his secondary schoolmates at Long John Silver’s in 2023.\n\nPhoto: Dr Hamid Razak\n\n“I know I’m supposed to be a doctor and supposed to be promoting good health, but it’s only once in a while you know?” he said.\n\nDr Hamid also shares a close bond with his family. His wife is a teacher and they have three children. His retired father spent over 40 years with the Immigration Checkpoints Authority and his mother is an admin officer at a preschool. He has two younger sisters.\n\nBusy as he is, he tries to meet for a family meal at least once a week at his parents’ house in Taman Jurong – the neighbourhood he calls home.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/aac1b1b7970ae7e36f9b9fcace2b985e43668f1e1631188f85545aec295d6ac0?w=825", "alt_text": "MP for West Coast-Jurong West GRC, Dr Hamid Razak, meeting residents at an International Women’s Day event at Yuhua Community Club."}]}

He’ll also carry a small yet powerful piece of home – the flavours of India.\n\nIn a remarkable fusion of science, symbolism and culinary comfort, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), has curated a special menu for the Indian Air Force officer, making him the first Indian to carry traditional Indian food to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nAmong the highlights of his menu: moong dal halwa, mango nectar and Indian rice.\n\nThis carefully chosen selection is more than a morale booster; it’s a cultural milestone.\n\nEach dish has been specially engineered to meet the safety and nutritional standards required for space travel while also capturing the essence of Indian cuisine.\n\nAs Group Captain Shukla becomes the second Indian to travel to space after Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma’s legendary 1984 mission, he will do so not just with scientific instruments, but with a taste of India.\n\nISRO’s Human Space Flight Centre in Bengaluru has led the charge in adapting Indian dishes for space.\n\nDirector D.K. Singh confirmed: “Shukla ji will get ghar ka khana (home food) along with international cuisine options approved by NASA.”\n\nThe packaging of mango nectar allows it to be sipped in microgravity, while the moong dal halwa – an energy-dense dessert – has been modified for safe consumption in orbit.\n\nIndian rice, however, presented a challenge. Unlike sticky rice commonly used in East Asia, Indian rice is fluffy and can float away in microgravity, making it harder to manage during meals.\n\nSpecial packaging and serving techniques have been developed to address this issue, ensuring Gp Capt Shukla can enjoy his meal without chasing stray grains across the ISS.\n\nThe inclusion of Indian food isn’t just about comfort – it’s about identity. In a mission filled with scientific ambitions, the presence of Indian delicacies sends a powerful message: India is ready to join the global space community on its own cultural and technological terms.\n\n“This is modern-day diplomacy through cuisine,” said a senior ISRO official. “It’s a way of saying: we are here, and we’re bringing our whole self – science, skill, and soul.”\n\nGp Capt Shukla himself echoed the sentiment in a statement: “This mission is a milestone for India. Even stars are attainable. Jai Hind.”\n\nThe Axiom Mission 4 is operated by US-based Axiom Space in partnership with NASA and international collaborators. Gp Capt Shukla will serve as the mission pilot alongside American astronaut and commander Peggy Whitson, Poland’s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski and Hungary’s Tibor Kapu.\n\nThe mission, now rescheduled to launch on June 10, was originally slated for May 29 and will last approximately 14 days. Once docked at the ISS, the crew will carry out over 60 scientific studies and commercial outreach activities, representing 31 countries.\n\nIndia’s contribution to these scientific efforts is significant. Gp Capt Shukla will conduct seven experiments related to food, agriculture and human biology – including groundbreaking research on whether green gram (moong) and fenugreek (methi) can sprout in microgravity.\n\nThese tests could lay the foundation for future space farming and sustainable food sources for long-duration missions.\n\nGp Capt Shukla’s journey isn’t just about this one flight. He’s among the top candidates for ISRO’s upcoming Gaganyaan mission – India’s first indigenous crewed orbital flight.\n\nHis experience aboard Axiom-4 will serve as a critical trial run, allowing ISRO to observe how an Indian astronaut adapts to life in space, carries out complex tasks and interfaces with international teams.\n\n“The hands-on exposure will be invaluable for Gaganyaan,” said ISRO chairman V. Narayanan, who reaffirmed his confidence in Shukla’s capability to complete the mission successfully.\n\nThe mission’s cost is estimated at Rs550 crore ($82.5 million), a price that reflects not just the high-tech nature of the endeavour, but the high hopes India is investing in its spacefaring future.\n\nBut for Gp Capt Shukla, the mission is also deeply personal. “I hope to ignite curiosity and excitement in young minds,” he said. “Space is not a distant dream, but a future they can shape.”\n\nDuring his time aboard the ISS, Shukla will engage with educators, students, and members of the global space industry, sharing insights and experiences aimed at sparking interest in STEM fields.\n\nIn a symbolic gesture, he will carry a swan as his zero-gravity indicator – the vehicle of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of wisdom. “It represents learning, purity and the ability to discern – values that define this mission,” he explained.\n\nCaption...\n\nPhoto:", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/94981c11035ffaa844242393b052491b1acf719749a9750daace2fd1676aebb9?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Shared widely on Instagram and later by Ms Veena herself on Facebook, the clip received an outpouring of support and humorous commentary, with some netizens joking that even prisoners receive better meals.\n\nBut more significantly, it highlighted a growing consensus: children deserve nutritious and enjoyable meals at their anganwadis.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kerala government responded in a big way. At the state-level inauguration of the annual Praveshanolsavam – a reopening ceremony for anganwadis – Ms Veena unveiled a revised, statewide unified food menu for children attending these centres.\n\nFor the first time, Kerala’s anganwadis will serve dishes like egg biryani, pulao, soya curry, chickpea curry, nutritious laddus, and even traditional snacks like kozhukkatta (dumpling made from rice flour, with a filling of grated coconut and jaggery) and elayada (steamed sweet wrapped in leaf), reported The Times of India.\n\nMilk and eggs, which were previously provided two days a week, will now be offered three times weekly.\n\nThe new meals have been developed with an eye on national nutrition standards, focusing on reducing sugar and salt intake while boosting protein and calorie content.\n\nThe menu includes detailed nutritional breakdowns for each dish and applies to breakfast, lunch and general supplementary feeding schedules.\n\n“This marks the first time a uniform food menu is being implemented across all state-run childcare centres,” said Ms Veena during her announcement. “The initiative ensures children are not just fed but nourished with meals they enjoy and that support their growth.”\n\nThough currently in Qatar with his parents, Shanku is thrilled by the news. “He is relishing the moment,” said Ms Aswathy, who along with her husband Somasundhar, have been keeping a close eye on how their son’s video has grown into a matter of public policy.\n\nThe family, originally from Prayar near Oachira in Alappuzha, plans to return to Kerala by mid-July.\n\nMs Aswathy explained that the biryani video was not intended to go viral. “I had been sharing pictures and videos of Shanku on Instagram for his father, who had just returned to Qatar after our son’s choroonu (first ceremonial rice meal).

Santosh Kumar\n\nWhen Mr Mahesh Sivaswamy uprooted his family from Mumbai to Singapore in July 1999, he had little more than a dream and a small office on Anson Road with three staff.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Transworld Group Singapore, the company he founded, has grown into a formidable US$400 million (S$518 million) enterprise with a presence in 11 countries and over 2,000 employees.\n\nMr Mahesh credits his father as his earliest inspiration. The late Mr R. Sivaswamy hailed from Kerala and founded his shipping and transportation business in India and the Middle East in the 1970s.\n\n“My father always said: “Action without delay is the secret of my success.” That has guided me throughout,” Mr Mahesh told tabla!.\n\nAt the time Mr Mahesh chose Singapore as his base, most of his peers were heading westward. “Nine out of ten people were going to the US or Europe,” he recalled. “But I saw potential in Asia. Singapore wasn’t the number one port then, but it was already a critical maritime hub.”\n\nWith whatever savings he had, accumulated while working earlier for his father’s company in India, he decided to get into the business scene in Singapore.\n\nMr Mahesh’s first break came just months into his move, when Maersk Line, the world’s largest container shipping company, awarded him a modest feeder service contract from Singapore to Bangladesh.\n\nThe Danish conglomerate was then looking to expand their Singapore venture, and Mr Mahesh was seeking business. Their synergies matched.\n\n“They were willing to understand what we were trying to do. That was our beginning,” he said.\n\nSoon after, Mr Mahesh launched Orient Express Lines, running feeder routes to Chittagong and Nhava Sheva in India.\n\nTwo years later, he ventured into ship ownership through Liberty Navigation, buying second-hand vessels and later commissioning new builds.\n\nIn 2007, he founded BLPL Singapore, a liner services company that now operates across 15 countries with over 30,000 containers in circulation.\n\nThe company grew by focusing on niche markets – river ports in the Indian subcontinent that had draught (depth) restrictions as well as other problems – which made most large shipping lines shun direct operations to these destinations.\n\nWith the rise in customer demand for integrated solutions, Mr Mahesh launched Transworld Global Logistics Solutions, offering freight forwarding, warehousing and trucking.\n\nEach company now operates under the Transworld Group Singapore umbrella.\n\nWhile Mahesh led from the helm, the journey was very much a family voyage. His wife Mala has been his steadfast partner since the early days, managing both business and home while the couple’s young children, Mithila and Murli, adapted to their new lives.\n\nNow adults, both children formally joined the company in 2023, taking Transworld into its next generation.\n\n“There was a point when we thought, if all four of us didn’t settle in well in Singapore, we’d go back,” Mr Mahesh said. “But things fell into place, and Mala’s support, especially in those early years, was invaluable.”\n\nMr Mahesh’s strategy has always been rooted in regional expertise and staying nimble.\n\n“We never tried to be a global giant,” he said. “Most global players are state-backed. We focused on Asia, from China and South Korea to the Indian subcontinent and East Africa.”\n\nThat focus has paid off. The company now boasts 10 verticals including ship owning, feeder services, ship management, linear shipping, container freight stations and wellness services for seafarers.\n\nIt continues to grow, with two more ships being bought this year and land expansions underway for new container freight stations across India.\n\n“Shipping is asset-heavy and very cyclical. But whether it’s good times or bad, we remain cautious. That’s been key,” he said.\n\nAt Transworld’s recent 25th anniversary celebration at Raffles Sentosa, Mr Mahesh invited the CEOs of each vertical on stage, applauding their contributions.\n\n“We started with four people. Today, we are more than 2,000. This is your celebration as much as it is mine,” he said in his speech.\n\n“Despite turbulent waves, Transworld Group Singapore navigates steadily, a testament to Mahesh’s patient leadership and wisdom. Their stability and resilience inspire,” said Mr S.C. Chan, chairman of SeaLead, a privately owned global shipping line with presence in 51 countries.\n\nTransworld’s future is already taking shape. With Dr Mithila, a clinical psychologist, and Mr Murli, an advocate and solicitor, onboard, Mr Mahesh is ensuring a smooth transition into a more digital, dynamic and diversified future.\n\nHe credits his culturally diverse team – which includes Indians, Chinese, Sri Lankans and Europeans – for propelling the business forward.\n\nOnly 85 employees are based in Singapore due to the high operating costs. The backbone of the operation runs seamlessly out of India.\n\nYet, as the group extends its reach across oceans, Mr Mahesh is clear that home base will always be Singapore.\n\n“I succeeded in Singapore. My family are all Singaporeans,” he said.\n\n“The success of all these companies under the Transworld Group are all Singaporean in nature. So our headquarters will always be here.”\n\n“Shipping is asset-heavy and very cyclical. But whether it’s good times or bad, we remain cautious. That’s been key.”\n\nMr Mahesh Sivaswamy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/03b536b34d34290db6f81f7cc4ff9dfbbfae98c665e04039949195bdced6f36f?w=825", "alt_text": "Mr Mahesh Sivaswamy with his daughter Mithila, wife Mala and son Murli."}]}

We will hold talks with the film chamber,” Mr Chinnappa told the court, prompting a sharp response from the bench: “This is your ego speaking.”\n\nThe court adjourned the matter to June 10 but not before offering a stern warning. “You have a right to speech... but not to hurt sentiments,” the judge said. “The spoken word can’t be taken back, but there can be an apology.

Narasimhulu said: “Kamal Haasan insists ‘I haven’t done anything wrong, so won’t apologise’.

This triggered backlash, with some accusing the actress of being difficult to work with.\n\nTensions escalated when director Sandeep Reddy Vanga took to X, shortly after Pinkvilla published an article revealing plot details of Spirit.\n\nThough he did not name Deepika directly, Vanga implied betrayal and hinted that she may have been linked to the leak, writing: “When I narrate a story to an actor, I place 100 per cent faith... But by doing this, you’ve DISCLOSED the person that you are… Is this what your feminism stands for?”\n\nThe cryptic yet pointed remarks have sparked outrage and prompted widespread debate in the industry. But many celebrities have since stepped in to support Deepika, framing her requests as entirely valid in a changing industry landscape.\n\nActress Tamannaah Bhatia subtly threw her support behind Deepika by liking a viral Instagram reel. The reel featured a resurfaced video of Deepika at a Chhapaak press conference in 2020, where she sternly rebuked a journalist who suggested her husband Ranveer Singh had financed her film.\n\nHer assertive response – “Excuse me, this is my money” – struck a chord again, especially in the context of current allegations. On-screen text on the reel highlighted issues like misogyny, gender pay gaps and double standards – themes many believe are relevant to the Spirit row.\n\nAt the trailer launch of Maa, actors Kajol and Ajay Devgn offered candid takes on the controversy, without naming names.\n\n“I love the fact if you can work less,” Kajol said, drawing laughter and applause. Ajay added: “Most honest filmmakers will not have a problem with this. It’s really about mutual respect and flexibility.”\n\nActor Saif Ali Khan, speaking at the Arab Media Summit, gave perhaps the most heartfelt endorsement of Deepika’s alleged stance.\n\n“I hate coming home and seeing the kids already asleep. That’s not success,” said Saif. “Success is being able to say, ‘No, I need to go home now to catch that half hour with them.’”\n\nHe continued, “We get four holidays a year, and when my kids are on break, I don’t work. That time is sacred. Success and privilege, for me, is being able to say no to work and yes to time with my family.”\n\nVeteran filmmaker Mani Ratnam, who directed Deepika in Ponniyin Selvan II, dismissed the backlash as unwarranted and out of sync with modern industry standards.\n\n“I think it is a rightful demand,” Ratnam told News18. “I’m glad she’s in a position to ask for it. It is not an unreasonable thing to ask, but an absolute necessity.”\n\nHe emphasised the importance of adapting to new expectations: “You have to acknowledge that, understand it and work around it. That’s the evolution of the industry.”\n\nAs speculation rages on, the makers of Spirit have announced that Triptii Dimri will replace Deepika as the female lead opposite Prabhas. This will mark her second collaboration with director Vanga.\n\nDeepika has yet to release an official statement on the matter and continues promotional duties for her upcoming film Kalki 2898 AD.\n\nThe controversy has not only reignited debates on gender dynamics in Bollywood but has also highlighted the growing call for structured professionalism. The notion that asking for an eight-hour workday or profit sharing is “unprofessional” is being met with increasing resistance, especially as more celebrities speak out in favour of such demands.\n\nOnline, fans and industry observers are echoing these sentiments, praising Deepika for standing her ground.\n\nHashtags like #IStandWithDeepika and #WorkLifeBalance are trending across social platforms, marking this moment as more than a celebrity spat – but a flashpoint in the conversation about professionalism, equity and respect in the Indian film industry.\n\n“I hate coming home and seeing the kids already asleep. That’s not success. Success is being able to say, ‘No, I need to go home now to catch that half hour with them.”\n\nActor Saif Ali Khan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/708374095338a46740374ef277bd60b90a35bb5de938e164bf57b56d5cf609c9?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9184db2e2ddc0f7f946e5ff0cea9d419b7852ce5b190507165c94b42a09ab773?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/708374095338a46740374ef277bd60b90a35bb5de938e164bf57b56d5cf609c9?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9184db2e2ddc0f7f946e5ff0cea9d419b7852ce5b190507165c94b42a09ab773?w=825", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/708374095338a46740374ef277bd60b90a35bb5de938e164bf57b56d5cf609c9?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

I discovered it a few days after moving into my Dover Close East flat in 1982.\n\nThe track is about 2km long. So it was then ideal to practice my 2.4km run that was compulsory for National Service reservists to complete every year.\n\nOn some evenings, my wife and I would wheel my daughter there in her pram.\n\nOne day, my three-year-old decided to stretch her legs and came across a column of black ants.\n\nShe was fascinated and we watched the ants for more than 15 minutes.\n\nPassers-by would peer over our shoulders to see what we were looking at. Many ended up shaking their heads in disappointment.\n\nEven now, I remember the incident whenever I pass that spot.\n\nWe visited the track rather frequently and it was impossible not to notice the other regulars and vice versa. Soon, we were greeting each other.\n\nThe track went through several upgrades and so did the surroundings.\n\nWhen the HDB flats at Ghim Moh Valley were being built, there were many snakes that were released from their homes.\n\nSome would appear on the track.\n\nIn a rather funny incident, a group of five women came across a 2m-long green snake resting across the track.\n\nThey were seriously discussing whether to call the National Environment Agency or the Animal  Concerns Research and Education Society to deal with the snake.\n\nThen came either a Filipino or Indonesian helper. She calmly picked up a stick, lifted the snake and dropped it in the grass at the side of the track.\n\nIt quickly slithered away and normal life resumed.\n\nThe track was also a catwalk for the changing trends.\n\nIn the beginning, there were several roller-skaters. Then, online skating – or rollerblading – became the in-thing.\n\nSome years later, there would be youngsters who would race up and down the track on their personal mobility devices.\n\nI never understood where the exercise component resided in that activity.\n\nNow, it is cycling.\n\nFashions have also changed. I belong to the generation which exercised in our old clothes. New clothes are for more auspicious activities.\n\nHowever, these days, it is not uncommon to see svelte damsels jogging in brand-new sports bras and tights.\n\nThere is also a rather elderly gentleman on a unicycle. That’s a bicycle with only one wheel. It is not a Penny Farthing which features a large front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel.\n\nI haven’t seen him for several weeks and hope all’s well with him.\n\nAs I grew older, my exercise regimen has also changed. Instead of jogging, it is now brisk walking.\n\nEven the brisk has been affected. In the past, I would overtake people. Now, I get overtaken by many who look older than I am.\n\nAlas, one day, I may be in a wheelchair but I will keep coming back to the track – for the memories.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/16d3e934c8906449a169ed798c73ec02a52917117e60a798454db41cd00f948b?w=825", "alt_text": "People cycle along the park connector running along the Ulu Pandan canal."}]}

A critical miscalculation allowed 19-year-old Gukesh to launch a precise counterattack and seize control.\n\nMoments after resigning, Carlsen slammed his fist onto the table, scattering pieces and drawing gasps from the audience and commentators alike. Though he quickly offered a handshake and a pat on the back to the victorious Indian teen, Carlsen’s frustration was evident as he stormed out of the venue.\n\n“I didn’t want to lose,” Gukesh said modestly after the match. “But yes, beating Magnus in any form is special.”\n\nGukesh, the youngest undisputed world champion in chess history, celebrated his 19th birthday just days before this landmark win.\n\nAfter a patchy start to the tournament, the Indian prodigy’s resilience and nerve paid off in spectacular fashion. His coach, Grzegorz Gajewski, credited Gukesh’s tenacity. “We have to give a lot of credit to Guki for his stubbornness and resourcefulness,” he said.\n\nThe win is not just another point on the board – it serves as a statement. Since Gukesh won the world title in 2024 after Carlsen declined to defend it, critics have questioned his legitimacy.\n\nCarlsen himself had previously taken a subtle jab at Gukesh with the social media post: “You come at the king, you best not miss.” On Sunday, Gukesh didn’t miss – and the chess world took notice.\n\nThe defeat rattled Carlsen, reported The Guardian. Speaking a day later, the 34-year-old reflected on the loss and his diminishing passion for classical chess.\n\n“On a normal day, I win that game,” he said, acknowledging Gukesh’s grit but lamenting his own lapse. “Losses are painful no matter what, but at least if I can lose doing something I really enjoy – like Freestyle or Blitz – then that’s easier.”\n\nCarlsen, who relinquished his world title in 2023, has since explored other formats like Freestyle Chess (Chess960), where the pieces begin in randomised positions.\n\nHe hinted that Sunday’s loss reinforced his growing disinterest in the traditional format: “Yesterday I asked myself, why am I even doing this?”\n\nThough he managed a win in the Armageddon tie-break against World No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura, Carlsen’s disappointment was still palpable. “I will finish this tournament, but I need to make some decisions about next year. I’m not saying I’ll never play classical chess again, but right now, it doesn’t appeal to me.”\n\nFor Gukesh, this win is more than a personal achievement – it’s a rebuttal to months of speculation and doubt, reported The Indian Express.\n\n“You try not to hear those comments that you’re champion only because Magnus didn’t play,” said coach Gajewski. “But when you beat him, it validates everything. It gives him the credit and the confidence he deserves.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined a chorus of congratulations, calling Gukesh’s victory “an exceptional achievement” that “showcases his brilliance and dedication”.\n\nThe young champion, who now sits just behind joint leaders Fabiano Caruana and Carlsen in the standings, is riding a wave of momentum heading into the final rounds.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gukesh lost to Nakamura in round 8, while Carlsen was beaten by China’s Wei Yi.\n\nWith two more rounds left to play, Caruana was leading the table with 12.5 points, followed by Carlsen (12), Gukesh (11.5) and Nakamura (11.5).\n\nThe Sunday incident – Carlsen’s slam, the stunned silence and Gukesh’s poised response – quickly went viral.\n\nThe video garnered over 8.5 million views on social media within 24 hours. Reactions ranged from criticism to empathy:\n\n“What a sore loser,” one user quipped, while another praised the emotional intensity: “Two elite athletes wearing their hearts on their sleeves. That’s why we love sports.”\n\nEven Carlsen’s outburst wasn’t entirely unfamiliar to Gukesh. “It’s not the way I wanted it to be, but okay, I’ll take it,” the teen said. “I’ve also banged a few tables myself.”\n\nWhat’s next for Carlsen remains uncertain. He hinted at shifting focus to hobbies like golf, and even as he remains one of the game’s most influential figures, the prospect of a future without him in classical formats looms large.\n\nMeanwhile, Gukesh’s path is clear: build on this triumph and continue to prove he belongs at the very top.\n\nThe chess pieces are strewn on the board after Magnus Carlsen slams the table, following the defeat by Gukesh Dommaraju.\n\nPhoto: @Chess Base India/X\n\n“On a normal day, I win that game.

After 18 long seasons, Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) finally broke their Indian Premier League (IPL) title drought with a heart-stopping six-run victory over Punjab Kings in the 2025 final on Tuesday.\n\nThe moment, heavy with history and emotion, saw Kohli – the tournament’s enduring face – sink to his knees, tears streaming, overcome by the weight of the moment he feared might never come.\n\n“I’ve given this team my youth, my prime, my experience,” Kohli said, voice trembling as he clutched the coveted trophy. “Eighteen long years. I never thought this day would come.”\n\nKohli’s 43-run knock in the final, gritty and tactical on a sluggish Ahmedabad pitch, may not have been flashy, but it was pivotal.\n\nIt was the kind of innings only a man driven by destiny could play – slow by T20 standards, yet steadying the team just enough.\n\nEvery dot ball in the final over by Josh Hazlewood added to the rising tension. When the last ball was bowled, Kohli dropped to the ground and punched the turf in joy.\n\n“This win is as much for the fans as it is for the team,” he said. “I’ve dreamt of this moment for so long – to win it with RCB, not any other team. My heart is with Bangalore. My soul is with Bangalore. That’s why this is so special.”\n\nThe victory capped an incredible year for Kohli. Already crowned champion in the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy, the IPL was the one missing piece. The title now cements his place not just as one of India’s greatest cricketers, but as a symbol of unwavering loyalty and grit.\n\nIn the dugout, emotional scenes unfolded – Kohli hugging longtime teammates, former captain AB de Villiers wiping away tears, wife Anushka Sharma clapping with joy. “I always dreamt of winning it with them,” Kohli said, “and I stuck around even when the going was tough”.\n\nKohli also used the moment to highlight the importance of Test cricket. Having recently retired from the longest format, he called it the “purest” version of the game. “This is right up there with my greatest moments,” he said. “But still, five levels below Test cricket. If you want to earn respect globally, give your heart to Tests.”\n\nKohli ends the season as RCB’s top scorer with 657 runs and eight half-centuries. And as he heads into the twilight of his career, the legacy is clear: a leader, a fighter, and finally a champion.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9582deea0ca0ee056cc57bd45fef3012ea5583999a481437d024bd08f65663de?w=825", "alt_text": "Virat Kohli reacts after RCB won the trophy."}]}

The report included only a brief, confusing snippet of the conversation recorded in the cockpit between the pilots, where one asks whether the other moved the fuel switch, to which the second responds that he had not.\n\nThe report said the investigation would continue and further evidence would be reviewed. Conclusive answers in plane crash investigations take months and in some instances years.\n\n“The fuel pump was shut off. That’s what they are saying,” Mr Thakur, 32, said on the phone from Ahmedabad. “But how can that be possible? That within seconds it was working fine, and then all of a sudden it was shut off.”\n\n“They must do a fair and thorough investigation,” he said. “Can you imagine – someone’s mother, someone’s son, someone’s daughter, and in some cases entire families, have been wiped off.”\n\nAmong those on board that day was Dr Nirali Patel, a 32-year-old dentist who had been living in Ontario, Canada. Dr Patel, who had moved to Canada after completing her studies in India, had returned to Ahmedabad to visit relatives. She is survived by her husband and baby son.\n\n“The report doesn’t give us anything so we can understand what exactly happened,” said Mr Umang Patel, her brother. “We were hoping for more than this.”\n\nMr Don Patel, a family friend, said he found the report’s findings “strange”.\n\nThe fact that pilots were deemed fit to fly, and the apparent confusion in the cockpit about how fuel had been cut, seemed to conflict: “If all those precautions have been taken, then why did this happen?” Mr Patel asked.\n\nThe loss has left Mr Thakur and his wife shell-shocked. They had nothing to do with the flight, with international travel being beyond their means.\n\nIn the days after the crash, the focus shifted to the same hospital where Mr Thakur delivered food. It was the site of a morgue where the remains of victims had been moved to, most so badly damaged that hundreds of DNA tests were required to sort out who was who.\n\nIt took more than three weeks after the crash for all the victims to be identified.\n\nEvery day, Mr Thakur arrived at the hospital, dazed and aching. In the confusion of an overwhelmed bureaucracy that had no answers, he looked to the doctors he had befriended while delivering their lunches.\n\nIn a hospital corner, he would quietly coordinate over the phone with a doctor to come see him. Soft-spoken, with a gentle smile, he would repeat the story of what had happened to his mother and daughter. The doctors listened patiently, there was little to do but await DNA results.\n\nHis wife’s blood pressure repeatedly dropped, and he had to take her to hospital. His son, Madhav, had questions.\n\n“My wife keeps crying,” Mr Thakur said. “Madhav asks me, ‘Where is my sister, papa?’ We tell him she is at the mess and will be back soon.”\n\nOnly on June 19, a week after the crash, was he notified that the bodies of his relatives had been identified, allowing the family to perform their final rites.\n\nOn the day the preliminary report came out, Mr Thakur’s social media feed was full of pictures he and his wife had taken with Adhya.\n\nThere is one of Adhya feeding her father an orange Popsicle, grinning at his exaggerated response to the chill.\n\nThere is a collage of different moments in her short life – as a baby arriving at home from the hospital, a wrapped bundle in her mother’s arms; and in a lilac dress and black shoes, propped on her father’s lap with her mother next to her.\n\n“Happy birthday, Adhya. Miss you too, child,” the poster says.\n\n“I would have fed her noodles and taken her to the park,” Mr Thakur said.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nPlane\n\nCrash\n\nControversy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/495f5f84ea0606506eb047e0c26cb64f90bfa959c2b57dc5f3a587d13c1539b3?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

However, not all have found this a threat to their creativity. Launched by Collective Media Network, a small division under the Collective Artists Network, Trilok is a new AI-generated Indian four-member band that blends spiritual tradition with contemporary rock music.\n\nThat’s right – India now has its own AI-powered rock band. In its press statement, the media company said that Trilok draws inspiration from Indian spiritual roots such as chants, mantras and emblems, and generates the soundscapes using artificial intelligence.\n\nA series of AI-generated visuals were posted on the band’s Instagram page (@trilokindiaofficial) to tease its debut, including its first track, “Achyutam Keshavam”, a classic Hindu devotional song. The artistes behind Trilok reimagined the classical piece, infused with rock influences.\n\nThe track was released on various music streaming platforms such as Apple Music, YouTube and Spotify on July 7. While some netizens are amazed, others felt that the band’s emergence will restrict opportunities for younger or independent artistes to break through in the already saturated music industry.\n\nAap Jaisa Koi\n\nDirected by Vivek Soni, the Hindi film Aap Jaisa Koi is a heartfelt romance about two teachers with opposite personalities who embark on a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns. The tender tale is set to premiere today on Netflix worldwide.\n\nThe film stars seasoned actor R. Madhavan as Shrirenu Tripathi, a shy and reticent Sanskrit teacher and Fatima Sana Shaikh as Madhu Bose, an outgoing and extroverted French teacher. Shrirenu lives by tradition while Madhu lives her life unapologetically.\n\nYet, an unexpected connection forms between both characters when they cross paths. The film marks Madhavan’s much-welcomed return to the romance genre. Some of his most notable romantic roles include playing the affable protagonist in Tamil films like Alaipayuthey released in 2000 and Minnale the following year.\n\nDeath of a Gentleman\n\nMumbai-based novelist Riva Razdan has put out yet another bold and evocative tale. This time, it’s a psychological thriller packed with chilling twists and unsettling truths. The story centres on the protagonist Yuvraaj Khanna, who is about to become a wealthy businessman after his grocery delivery startup reaches US$900 million in valuation.\n\nHowever, the death of his affluent father, who had abandoned him as a child, becomes a major setback. The murder investigation pins Yuvraaj as the main suspect and unveils deep-rooted rivalries and unresolved tensions.\n\nDeath of a Gentleman is set in the dazzling yet terribly competitive world of Mumbai’s elite and page by page, unearths the dark secrets beneath the city’s glamorous facade. The novel received a rating of 4.7 stars out of 5 on Amazon India.

She was 87, succumbing to age‑related ailments.\n\nBorn Radha Devi on\n\nJan 7, 1938\n\n, in the then Kingdom of Mysore, Saroja’s rise began at 17 with the Kannada film Mahakavi Kalidasa (1955), a performance that earned national attention and set her on an unstoppable trajectory.\n\nWithin three years, she lit up Tamil screens in Nadodi Mannan (1958) opposite M.G. Ramachandran (MGR), her breakthrough as a leading lady in a Tamil blockbuster. Her boundless talent and poise soon earned her titles like ‘Abhinaya Saraswathi’ in Kannada and ‘Kannadathu Paingili’ in Tamil, which was evidence of her chameleonic appeal across South India.\n\nOver seven decades, she starred in over 200 films across Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi, famously appearing in 161 consecutive lead roles between 1955 and 1984. She shared screen space with icons, including the likes of Sivaji Ganesan, N.T. Rama Rao, Rajkumar, and Shammi Kapoor.\n\nBeyond box‑office acclaim, her awards underscore her impact: Padma Shri in 1969, Padma Bhushan in 1992, Tamil Nadu’s Kalaimamani, an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University, a National Film Awards jury leadership role and vice‑presidency at Kannada Chalanchitra Sangha.\n\nHer personal convictions were no less compelling. Widowed in the 1980s, she chose independence over re-marriage, famously declaring she was confident she “could manage life without a male companion”.\n\nOn July 14, dignitaries and fans converged at her residence, marking the end of an era. Prime Minister Modi lauded her as an “exemplary icon of Indian cinema and culture,” highlighting her influence beyond South India.\n\nSaroja Devi’s legacy extends far deeper than screen time.

Santosh Kumar\n\nFrom the dusty fields of Sasaram in Bihar to the hallowed turf of Edgbaston, England, Akash Deep’s journey is a stirring tale of resilience, heartbreak and triumph.\n\nOn July 6, the 28-year-old fast bowler etched his name into history by claiming 10 wickets in India’s second Test win over England. More significantly, the 336-run win was India’s first ever Test victory at Edgbaston since 1967 and their biggest away win.\n\nBut Akash Deep’s rise has been anything but easy.\n\nBorn in 1996, in a state where cricket opportunities were virtually nonexistent, Akash’s passion for the sport was often seen as an indulgence. Facing criticism and ridicule, he was frequently advised to abandon cricket and pursue a government job.\n\nHis father, like many others in the town, wished for him to become a police constable or clerk. Out of respect, Akash appeared for several exams, only to return the answer sheets blank. Cricket, for him, was non-negotiable.\n\nHis breakthrough came when he left Bihar for Durgapur, West Bengal, and began playing club cricket. However, life took a cruel turn in 2015 when he lost both his father and elder brother within six months.\n\nWith the burden of supporting his family now on his shoulders, Akash stepped away from cricket to focus on his two sisters.\n\nBut the dream never died.\n\nTraining under the mentorship of Indian pace bowler Mohammed Shami, he worked on his fitness and refined his bowling. In 2019, his efforts bore fruit when he broke into Bengal’s Under-23 team and soon made his first-class debut.\n\nHis standout performances in the 2019-20 Ranji Trophy season, where he picked up 35 wickets and helped Bengal reach the final, cemented his place as a promising talent.\n\nThe Indian Premier League came calling in 2022 when Royal Challengers Bengaluru signed him. Though his outings were limited, he remained a force in domestic cricket, eventually earning his Test debut against England in 2024.\n\nOn a cloudy Edgbaston pitch, without the rested Indian spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, Akash seized his opportunity. With sheer pace and unwavering discipline, he ripped through England’s batting, helping India level the series 1-1.\n\nBut behind this dominant display lay another emotional battle: Akash’s elder sister, Akhand Jyoti Singh, is fighting stage three cancer.\n\n“I haven’t told anyone till now,” Akash revealed in a post-match interview. “She’s stable now, but she’s been undergoing treatment for two months. I dedicate this match to her. Every time I held the ball, I thought of her.”\n\nJyoti, emotional yet proud, told Aajtak news channel: “Before the England tour, we met him at the airport. I told him, ‘Don’t worry about me, just do well for the country’. Watching him take those wickets filled us with joy.”\n\nFormer Bengal coach Arun Lal recalls Akash’s initial days at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) dormitory. “It was a hellhole. I was shocked when I visited. But he never once complained. He trained relentlessly, even running up jungle-covered hills near his village.”\n\nAkash’s story is now viral, with fans celebrating not just his cricketing exploits, but his courage and perseverance. He has now played eight Tests and picked up 25 wickets, with the Edgbaston Test being a personal and national milestone.\n\nHis place in the third Test at Lord’s is all but confirmed, and as India eye a series win, Akash Deep stands as a symbol of hope – proof that dreams, backed by grit, can defy even the harshest odds.\n\nSports\n\nCricket", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f63c55aa7f33b2eead9c7e5717f0ec618c64de26cfab06069bef6f17b1617466?w=825", "alt_text": "Akash Deep celebrating India’s win over England at Edgbaston."}]}

Sarangapany and late editor V.T. Arasu, was also honoured with a memento by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam.\n\nDescribing the event as “not just a Tamil event but a Singapore event”, Ms Nirmala said that the gala reflected a cooperative spirit.\n\nShe joined Tamil Murasu in 2005, soon after Singapore Press Holdings had acquired the paper, and served until mid-2011.\n\n“We worked with photographers, the finance and marketing teams, even the photo desk. At that time, the relationships were still forming. We had to build trust and respect, and we did,” she said.\n\nNoting that the paper has evolved over time, Ms Nirmala described the focus on the online edition as a positive development, in alignment with other newspapers. Yet, she remains a stickler on the principles of print journalism.\n\n“Print is more challenging to do than visual. With visuals, you can lean on moving images and sound. But in print, you are a wordsmith, a surgeon of language. You must hold your reader from the first word to the last,” she said.\n\nReferring to international publications like The New York Times which have preserved the art of storytelling even as they adapt to digital formats, Ms Nirmala opined that well-crafted, long-form writing will continue to be in vogue with readers, even in an ubiquitously online environment.\n\n“Tamil journalism is not just a translation of English,” she noted. “It has its own idioms, rhythm and logic. To write Tamil, you must think in Tamil.”\n\nMr Rajendran expressed his hope that Tamil Murasu would celebrate a 100th anniversary.\n\nCompanies that last beyond 100 years tend to be the ones that thrive, he noted.\n\n“Look at Coca-Cola, Kraft, others. The stretch from 90 to 100 is absolutely critical,” he said.\n\nAppointed Tamil Murasu’s deputy editor in 2006 and its editor in 2010, Mr Rajendran oversaw the paper’s digital transformation until he stepped down in 2024. He was also the editor of tabla! for the first six months when it started in 2008, and thereafter he was supervising editor till 2018, when he became editor until July 4, 2025.\n\n“In this day and age, survival requires both strong leadership and financial support. Back then, Tamil Murasu wasn’t making money – circulation and advertising were declining, much like what we’re seeing today.

As kids, birthdays were pure magic – balloons, sugar highs and running around like headless chickens in superhero masks.\n\nIt’s a day when you feel like royalty, carefully selecting which friends are worthy of attending your party.\n\nThen come the teenage years, when birthdays are less about cake and more about whether that cute guy you have a crush on will turn up for your party.\n\nBy the time you hit your 30s, birthdays become a psychological battle. You don’t want a big party, but also, if no one makes a fuss, you feel slightly offended. You tell people “it’s just another day”, but secretly hope someone organises a surprise celebration.\n\nAt 50 and beyond, the game changes. People start announcing their birthdays weeks in advance. Instead of hiding the number, they proudly declare: “Can you believe I’m turning 60? Still young at heart!” (And then expect everyone to comment: “No way! You don’t look a day over 45!”).\n\nAs we grow even older, they become something else entirely. Some look forward to them, others dread them, and a few pretend birthdays don’t matter in the continuum of time.\n\nBut here’s a thought – if FB didn’t remind people, would anyone remember birthdays? And does receiving 400 digital wishes make you feel more loved, or just slightly disappointed that it was still less than the 550 that Jayesh received? Does reading “HBD” from someone you are struggling to remember make you feel special? Or is it just an annual reminder of how many acquaintances you’ve collected over the years?\n\nIn the past, remembering someone’s special day meant the date was handwritten in your calendar. You found a card, wrote a personal message in your cursive handwriting and posted it, so it reached in time for the birthday.\n\nI sometimes walked around for hours from shop to shop, reading Hallmark birthday cards to find the appropriate message inside.\n\nSome of these cards received from spouses, children and special friends were then stashed away in a box to read and enjoy 20 years later.\n\nToday, cryptic, highly abbreviated and emoji-ed digital greetings are buried in the cloud, never to be seen again.\n\nHonestly, when I receive tons of messages on my FB for my birthday, I feel appreciated and loved, and I am convinced that those sending me messages really mean it, at least a teeny-weeny bit.\n\nThe next day I sheepishly thank the universe and all my friends about how blessed I am for the outpouring of birthday messages and receive another 50 wishing you a belated birthday.\n\nAs for the WhatsApp group messages, have you noticed how one caring person wishes you, and it is followed immediately by a cascade pings and greetings by everyone else like they all remembered within micro seconds of each other?\n\nIn fact, it’s like they don’t want to be seen as the one who hasn’t wished you, even if they’re on an icebreaker in Alaska without Wi-Fi.\n\nSometimes, I receive notifications from FB to wish those who have passed away. Crazy!\n\nSo, what’s the real test? Turn off your birthday notifications and see who still remembers. Warning: the results may be disappointing.\n\nDo celebrating birthdays really make us happier?\n\nAs kids, birthdays are pure joy, but as we age, they become a time for reflection.\n\nSome feel grateful, others anxious. The milestone birthdays – 30, 40, 50 – often come with existential questions: What have I achieved? Am I where I thought I’d be? Why is my back hurting for no reason?\n\nAnd yet, despite the mixed emotions, we continue celebrating. Why? Because birthdays are one of the few traditions that let us feel special, even if just for a day.\n\nThey give us permission to pause, to reconnect, to be showered with attention (even if half of it is from people we last saw in 2011).\n\nWhether you love them, hate them or pretend they don’t exist, birthdays remain a universal marker of time – a moment to acknowledge where you’ve been and where you’re going.\n\nFinal thought: If no one sang, would it still be your birthday?\n\nAt the end of the day, birthdays aren’t about the number of messages, the size of the party, or even the cake (though let’s be honest, the cake is important).\n\nThey’re about being remembered – not just because Facebook said so, but because someone, somewhere, genuinely cares that you exist.\n\nAnd, if they don’t? Well, at least you don’t have to awkwardly stand around while people sing “Happy Birthday” to you.\n\nWould you still celebrate your birthday if no one else did?\n\nMaybe that’s the real question.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/d40ce6d255da9a0fdcacbce6ee1c91af182810b122ef3f5446d7c814779fba15?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

The company’s shares were up 1.4 per cent in US pre-market trading.\n\nSome other global airlines were weighing their own inspections or had begun their own checks.\n\nIn a statement, Japan’s JAL said safety was its top priority, adding: “We are closely monitoring the investigation into the incident and will implement any necessary inspections based on its findings.”\n\nAt the weekend, Air India Group started checking the locking mechanism on the fuel switches of its Boeing 787 and 737 fleets and has discovered no problems yet, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nAbout half the group’s 787s have been inspected and nearly all its 737s, the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. Inspections were set to be completed in the next day or two.\n\nOn July 13, citing a document and sources, Reuters reported that the planemaker and the FAA had privately issued notifications to airlines and regulators that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes were safe and that checks were not required.\n\nThe Air India crash preliminary report said the airline had not carried out the FAA’s suggested inspections as the FAA’s 2018 advisory was not a mandate.\n\nIt also said maintenance records showed that the throttle control module, which includes the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the plane involved in the crash.\n\nIn an internal memo on July 14, Air India chief executive Campbell Wilson said the investigation into the crash was far from over and that it was unwise to jump to premature conclusions, following the release of the preliminary report.\n\nREUTERS\n\nPlane\n\nCrash\n\nIndia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/da11fc128db13c1277036c99885758df04f1a6646f8edc05401c6199f16adbfb?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

It is a side project.”\n\nThe 49-year-old, who lost the 2024 Lok Sabha election from Amethi but remains active in the Bharatiya Janata Party, emphasised that acting has always been a parallel pursuit, not a replacement.\n\n“You’re given assignments within your organisation. My last assignment was in Bikaner. Before that, I was dispatched to Ranchi, Jharkhand,” she explained, reaffirming her continued involvement with party work.\n\nDrawing a comparison to her peers, she remarked: “Many politicians are part-time lawyers, part-time teachers, part-time journalists. The only difference between me and them is that I come with a videographer, a scriptwriter and a makeup person.”\n\nThe announcement of her television comeback came with the reveal of her first look as Tulsi, dressed in a Banarasi saree, which quickly went viral.\n\nThe reboot is being spearheaded by producer Ekta Kapoor, and the show will premiere on July 29 on Star Plus and JioHotstar. Several original cast members are expected to return.\n\nSmriti’s connection to Tulsi remains strong. “It’s as though we never left,” she said of returning to the set. Despite a 16-year gap, she claims her media and political careers have long run parallel. “Even in 2003, when I began my political journey, I was Tulsi,” she pointed out.\n\nReflecting on her career, she said acting took a backseat because of the nature of her political responsibilities. “As a former information and broadcasting and education minister, those are constitutional positions. You can’t just say, ‘I need to go and shoot’.”\n\nSmriti also discussed how politics has deepened her abilities as an actor. “Actors are meant to absorb and observe life. Politics helps you understand people and the nation at a deeper level.”\n\nWhen asked if Tulsi had shaped her, she replied, “It was not Tulsi impacting Smriti, it was Smriti impacting Tulsi.” She believes her authenticity allowed audiences to resonate with the character.\n\nAddressing criticism that the show glamorised patriarchy, Smriti dismissed the claims, noting that Kyunki tackled bold themes like marital rape, adult literacy, and euthanasia 25 years ago. “We created prime time from a dead 10.30pm slot.

The crash claimed the lives of 241 passengers and crew on board and 19 people on the ground.\n\nThese fuel control switches, located beneath the throttle levers, are surrounded by protective brackets and feature metal stop locks to prevent accidental operation. Shifting one of them from RUN to CUTOFF mid-flight would immediately halt fuel supply to the engine, resulting in a loss of thrust and disabling electrical generators linked to that engine.\n\nIf an engine catches fire, the fuel control switch for the affected engine would turn red to alert the crew.\n\nHowever, according to reports, the advanced fly-by-wire flight control system of Boeing-787 automatically compensates for any difference in thrust coming from one of the engines.\n\nIts flaperons, ailerons and rudder would automatically adjust to keep the aircraft flying straight. The pilots also receive a tactile cue.\n\nSources told Air Current that the black box data does not confirm whether the switches were moved by mistake, on purpose or due to some other issue before or after the apparent loss of thrust.\n\n“There’s no way to accidentally bump and move these switches,” aviation safety expert John Cox told The Air Current, emphasising that deliberate force is needed to alter their position.\n\nThe Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has submitted its preliminary report to the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Their joint soundtrack aims to match the film’s grandeur with a transcendent score that combines spiritual gravitas with emotional depth.\n\nMeanwhile, the film’s VFX is in the hands of DNEG, ensuring visual consistency across both instalments.\n\nSet to release during Deepavali 2026 and Deepavali 2027 respectively, the two-part series is poised to create a cultural moment that stretches well beyond its cinematic timeline.\n\nThe early market optimism – from investor backing to viral fan enthusiasm – signals that Ramayana is already proving itself a financial blockbuster, even before hitting the big screen.\n\nWith plans underway for global distribution through a Hollywood partner, Ramayana could become India’s biggest cultural export to date. The film’s ability to generate economic, artistic, and cultural capital long before its release has left industry insiders predicting that it may well redefine the financial potential of Indian cinema on the world stage.\n\n“This is a cultural movement for every Indian around the world. With Ramayana, we’re not just retelling history; we’re introducing our legacy to the world. Bringing together the finest global talent allows us to tell this story with authenticity, emotion and state-of-the-art cinematic innovation. We’ve seen Ramayana portrayed before – but this version reimagines its landscapes, creatures and battles with the scale and splendour they deserve.”\n\nProducer Namit Malhotra\n\nMovie\n\nBollywood", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/559115352a06afc8a1f2f1f23a31492fc816825fb9b9a5c441f9f86f5ab669eb?w=825", "alt_text": "Still from Ramayana’s first look teaser."}]}

But 21-year-old K Harini is rewriting that story, cleat by cleat.\n\nA leader, coach, and full-time student, Harini is not just balancing the demands of a sportswoman; she is dribbling through them with a vision.\n\n“I started when I was 13, in an inter-school C-Division tournament,” she recalls. “At the time, women’s football wasn’t big in Singapore. There was no platform. You just had to figure it out.” That instinct to play, despite the absence of infrastructure, would later carry her to international tournaments in Thailand, Kazakhstan and Myanmar, and eventually into Singapore’s Under-16 national team. Then, just as momentum was gathering, COVID-19 hit. Competitions evaporated and dreams paused. But not for long.\n\nAt 17, she became the girls’ football team’s captain at Republic Polytechnic (RP).\n\nHarini on the football field.\n\nPHOTO: K Harini\n\n“It was a character-building experience,” she says. “Being captain isn’t about shouting instructions. It’s about being adaptable, listening to your team and still delivering under pressure.” Her coach, whom she says is her greatest mentor, taught her how to lead, not by command but by example.\n\n“She trusted me and guided me to utilise my potential.”\n\nHarini took the RP team to victory at the POL-ITE and IVP tournaments – annual sporting competitions in Singapore for polytechnics, ITE, and universities – earning the “Captain of the Year” title in 2024. “Winning under your captaincy feels so good,” she said with a cheeky laugh.\n\nHarini at her graduation ceremony.\n\nPHOTO: Republic Polytechnic\n\nAs the second of four siblings,\n\nHarini took on part-time work coaching at the French Football Academy Singapore, clocking long weekend hours while juggling studies and matches. Her lecturers were understanding, offering extensions on assignments she could not submit on time. \n\n“I needed to keep myself around football,” she says. “Coaching reminded me why I fell in love with football in the first place.”\n\nAt RP, she committed to the bigger picture by enrolling in the Diploma in Sports Coaching.\n\n“I wanted to share with the next generation of girls what I didn’t have. It was the next best option after pursuing being a competitive footballer full-time,” Harini said.\n\nA six-month internship at Bangkok Football Club sharpened her skills off the pitch. She learned how to plan sessions, improvise when needed and manage large-scale events, like the Thailand International Youth Cup. “It’s in the same area of enjoying and loving football; it is not playing but rather encouraging people to play.”\n\nBack home, she applied those skills to coaching girls aged 10 to 12 at St. Andrews International School, guiding them through interschool tournaments with a focus not just on winning, but on growing.\n\nToday, she continues to coach even younger toddlers as young as four years old at the French Football Academy. And the transformation she’s witnessed is deeply personal. One of her proudest moments came recently when a four year old girl she coached was promoted to the under-9 girls’ team – not just holding her own, but outplaying boys older than her.\n\nHarini herself hasn’t stopped playing. She’s now part of Hougang United’s newly formed women’s team, currently halfway through their inaugural season. It’s not glamorous work, and women’s football in Singapore still lacks the backing of its male counterpart. “Even for men, it’s hard – they go overseas to try and make it. But for women, it’s harder because management does not think we are profitable.”\n\nStill, Harini sees hope, not just in herself, but in the growing number of young girls lacing up their boots each week. She’s seeking more school coaching roles, intent on expanding access and visibility. “If I can help one girl stay in the game when she’s told not to bother, that’s already a win.”\n\nHer parents, while supportive, always understood the stakes. “They never stopped me,” she says. “But they knew what I was up against.” She says her biggest inspiration is former American national player Alex Morgan, who continued to play the sport after having a child. “It’s really nice to see that passion and fire that she has to play football.”\n\nThat’s why her coaching is more than a side job. By shaping a future she may never fully benefit from, Harini is laying the groundwork for something bigger than herself. “It’s not about me,” she says, almost as an afterthought. “It’s about the girls who come next.”\n\nIn that way, Harini isn’t just playing the game, she’s changing it in her own way.\n\nSports\n\nFootball\n\nWomen", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5ee55c4d7f7e75aaf137ff62a6a0975b772a33d59587bcd808843bc30f6e0764?w=825", "alt_text": "Harini during her coaching sessions."}]}

Their relationship reportedly soured after Mr Mahdi allegedly forged marriage documents, confiscated Priya’s passport and subjected her to physical and emotional abuse.\n\nAccording to court documents, Priya attempted to sedate Mr Mahdi to retrieve her passport, but he died from an apparent overdose. His dismembered body was found in a water tank, leading to Priya’s arrest.\n\nIn 2020, a trial court sentenced her to death, and the Yemeni Supreme Judicial Council upheld the ruling in 2023. In January 2024, the Houthi-led administration’s political council approved the execution, and authorities have now confirmed that it will take place on July 16.\n\nUnder Yemen’s Islamic legal framework, there is a final hope: the tradition of diyat, or blood money, which allows a victim’s family to pardon the accused in exchange for financial compensation.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to save Priya, her supporters have raised US$1 million to offer Mr Mahdi’s family. But so far, the family has not responded.\n\nSocial activist Samuel Jerome, who is representing Priya’s mother Prema Kumari, has been negotiating directly with Mr Mahdi’s family and tribal leaders, reported the BBC.\n\nMr Jerome confirmed that the prison authorities in Sanaa have received formal notice of the execution. He is scheduled to return to Yemen this week to continue talks and deliver the diya offer in person.\n\n“The execution date has been conveyed to the jail authorities,” Mr Jerome said. “We are still trying to save her. But ultimately, the family must agree to a pardon.”\n\nMadam Prema Kumari, a domestic worker from Kochi, has been in Yemen since April 2024, lobbying tirelessly for her daughter’s release. In a recent video appeal, she pleaded with Indian authorities to intervene. “This is my final plea,” she said.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed that it has been providing consular support since the case began and remains in contact with Yemeni authorities and Priya’s family. However, India’s lack of formal diplomatic channels with the Houthi-controlled regions of Yemen has complicated negotiations.\n\n“We have been following the matter closely since she was sentenced to death,” an MEA official told reporters on July 8. “We continue to remain engaged and are rendering all possible assistance.”\n\nMeanwhile, support has been pouring in from Priya’s hometown of Poonkayam in Kerala. Villagers, family members and childhood friends are holding prayer meetings and appealing to the Indian government for urgent diplomatic intervention.\n\nPriya’s husband Tomy, a daily-wage worker from Idukki, said he was devastated by the prospect of his 12-year-old daughter, Michele, losing her mother.\n\n“I’ve knocked on every door possible to save Nimisha,” he said. “My only hope now is that the government will step in to bring her home.”\n\nMichele, who lives in a school hostel in Kothamangalam, speaks to her mother through weekly phone calls. The family says she is aware of her mother’s situation and is praying for her return.\n\nThe Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, a global advocacy group formed to campaign for her release, has played a crucial role in raising funds and awareness. The council said it remains hopeful that Mr Mahdi’s family will accept the diya and that negotiations in the final days may lead to a reprieve.\n\nAdding a potential diplomatic angle, reports have emerged that Iran, which maintains close ties with the Houthi leadership, may be willing to support mediation efforts. If successful, such an initiative could offer a rare opening for India to secure clemency in a highly sensitive case.\n\nMs Vinitha Radhakrishnan, Priya’s childhood friend and schoolmate, echoed the sentiments of many who know her. “We can never imagine Nimisha killing someone,” Ms Vinitha told The Times of India. “She was honest and well-mannered.

This being SG60, I would like to acknowledge your role in nation-building,” she noted.\n\nMrs Teo made these remarks on July 6 while speaking at TM’s 90th anniversary celebration.\n\nHeld at the Fairmont Singapore hotel, the event was attended by about 1,000 guests, including community leaders, stakeholders and local Tamil writers.\n\nPresident Tharman Shanmugaratnam was the guest of honour. Other senior government officials who attended include Ministers Indranee Rajah and Edwin Tong, Acting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Senior Ministers of State, Janil Puthucheary and Murali Pillai, Minister of State Dinesh Vasu Dash, as well as Members of Parliament Vikram Nair and Dr Hamid Razak.\n\nSeveral cultural performances and a video showcasing Tamil Murasu’s history were featured on stage. Guests were given a memento bag with Tamil Murasu’s 90-page bumper issue specially made for the anniversary.\n\nMrs Teo reflected on TM’s rare journey as one of the very few newspapers worldwide to have survived over 90 years.\n\n“You lived through colonial rule and the Japanese Occupation, when you were forced to cease publication. Your journey was closely intertwined with Singapore’s path to independence,” she said.\n\nExcept for India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, none of the countries with sizeable Tamil populations exceeding 200,000 have a Tamil news publication with a daily print run, she added.\n\nWhile neighbouring Malaysia continues to have two Tamil dailies, they have about two million Tamils, or around ten times the number in Singapore, Mrs Teo noted.\n\nMDDI Minister Josephine Teo accompanied by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Tamil Murasu editor Raja Segar, EMTM editor-in-chief Wong Wei Kong and SPH CEO Chan Yeng Kit.\n\nPHOTO: Tamil Murasu\n\nThe First Drafts of History\n\nJournalism is the first draft of history, noted Mrs Teo, who said that newspapers document events as they unfold, even if imperfectly, and historians later refine these.\n\nIn the 1960s, when Singapore transitioned from kampongs (villages) to public housing, many Indian families were worried about losing their cultural and religious ties.\n\nEven while acknowledging the sense of loss felt by some, TM helped paint a hopeful vision of improved living standards, modern infrastructure and a shared national identity rooted in HDB towns, Mrs Teo said.\n\n“Through editorials and stories, Tamil Murasu helped the Indian community view this transition not as displacement and loss, but as an active participation in Singapore’s modernisation and progress,” she said.\n\nDelivering news with empathy\n\nShe also spoke about how Tamil Murasu promoted constructive dialogue around Singapore’s bilingual policy, avoiding a deepening of divisions, as some groups at that time tried to pit the English-speaking elite against vernacular language defenders.\n\n“The bilingual education policy has been instrumental in helping our citizens seize opportunities for growth by being plugged into the global economy, while staying rooted in our heritage and culture,” Mrs Teo said.\n\n“In those moments, Tamil Murasu served as a bridge – helping the public understand the rationale for bilingualism while also voicing the concerns of the community.”\n\nShe also noted the continued use of TM’s student supplement, Maanavar Murasu, first launched in 1952. “Many in the audience would remember growing up with Tamil Murasu – reading it in Tamil classes or for schoolwork,” she told the audience.\n\nTouching on the Covid-19 pandemic, Mrs Teo acknowledged Tamil Murasu’s timely communication of important public health information to Tamil speakers, including migrant workers.\n\n“Such stories uplifted and united; they affirmed the community’s contributions and encouraged aspiration.”\n\nA new avatar for a new generation\n\nMrs Teo praised TM’s recent efforts to make general election coverage relatable to young readers.\n\nNamed Ilaya Thalaimurai, the young audience channel of Tamil Murasu produced vodcasts and short videos reflecting young voters’ aspirations during the General Elections 2025 to help explain the electoral process to first-time voters.\n\nShe emphasised that this valuable work would not have been possible without a committed team behind the scenes. She also expressed joy at the event’s recognition of former editors.\n\n“As we look to the future, I encourage Tamil Murasu to continue being a relevant and trusted platform that helps citizens stay informed and engaged.”\n\nShe acknowledged that this will not be easy, citing technological disruption and evolving consumer preferences.\n\n“I’m therefore heartened to see Tamil Murasu experimenting with new products and approaches to strengthen relations with its audiences.\n\nThe youth dialogues you organise on topical issues allow you to grow deep and meaningful connections with the next generation,” she highlighted.\n\nMrs Teo further affirmed the Government’s commitment to supporting TM in remaining a strong voice for the Tamil community through innovative approaches.\n\n“We made it a condition of funding to SPH Media Trust, that vernacular media must be supported and strengthened,” she said.\n\nTamil Murasu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/dc2c8619eafb527a648eeabda34aaac21cc086089307b142226078f89e5eea08?w=825", "alt_text": "MDDI Minister Josephine Teo speaking at Tamil Murasu’s 90th anniversary celebration."}]}

Let us try,” Mr Raja, 63, said.\n\nHeld on July 6 at Fairmont Singapore with over 1,000 guests, the gala was marked by a recollection of TM’s rich history and legacy, as well as its efforts in digital transformation.\n\nMr Raja traced TM’s humble beginnings to July 6, 1935, when it was founded as a weekly newsletter of the Tamils Reform Association.\n\n“It soon became the voice of the Tamil community,” he noted. “It covered news, events, initiatives and government policies – and more importantly, how those policies impacted our people. It was also a bridge to the homeland for many early migrants who longed to stay connected.”\n\nMany in the Tamil community have emotional ties with TM.\n\nThere are readers who still have yellowed copies of Tamil Murasu from decades ago – clippings of poems, obituaries, wedding announcements or community triumphs. That shows how much this paper has meant to people’s lives.\n\nAcknowledging past editors and their families, Mr Raja said: “They carried this dream through difficult times, with limited resources and unwavering dedication. We are standing on their shoulders.\n\n“I thank those who applaud us, and I also thank those who occasionally scold us. That sense of ownership, like a parent’s love, is something we feel deeply.”\n\nCeaselessly Transforming\n\nOver the past nine decades, Tamil Murasu has endured and evolved.\n\n“It survived World War II. It continued through the merger and separation of Singapore and Malaysia, and had a strong presence in Malaysia with a separate edition. That separation was not easy for the paper either,” Mr Raja said.\n\nAs technology transformed the media landscape, TM adapted early and boldly.\n\n“We were one of the first, if not the first, Tamil newspapers in the world to go digital,” he said. “In the late 1990s, we began using computers to set our pages, at a time when Tamil fonts were still being developed. Our website launched in 2000. It was a herculean task.”\n\nSpecial mention was made of veteran journalist and TM chief sub-editor A.S. Kunalan, who was part of the publication’s digital transformation.\n\nToday, TM has more than 300,000 followers across various social media platforms.\n\n“We embraced change, from Facebook to mobile-first storytelling – and now we’re experimenting with Artificial Intelligence to see how it can help make Tamil Murasu better,” Mr Raja said. “Tonight, we do not just celebrate a newspaper. We celebrate a living legacy and a heritage.”\n\nLooking to the future, Mr Raja Segar laid out a bold vision: “In the next 10 years, Tamil Murasu will strive to become a global Tamil media organisation, with Singapore as its home. We want to reach Tamils not just here, but across the world.”\n\nHe emphasised that this ambition would only be possible with the support of the community.\n\n“We cannot pull the chariot alone. To grow with the community, we need your help – your subscriptions and advertising support will make a real difference.”\n\nHe reaffirmed TM’s commitment to quality journalism and linguistic integrity while adapting to the tastes of younger readers. “We are learning new storytelling methods – sharper, shorter, more suited to fast-paced lives. But our quality will remain. We will not dilute the Tamil language or the truth.”\n\nThe event concluded with the signing of three Memorandums of Understandings (MoUs), marking new partnerships to support TM.\n\nSingapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), Tamil Nadu-based news outlet Hindu Tamil Thisai and the Singapore Indian Education Trust (SIET) were the three signatories.\n\n“To our non-Tamil organisation leaders here, we shall meet very soon to chart the path forward for tabla!. It has huge potential to unite the community, and we need your support,” Mr Raja said.\n\nAnniversary\n\nTamil Murasu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9ef15d5442ec99711db2e3436d82b98936069de77f28d1eaafbb7f7459eb4113?w=825", "alt_text": "Tamil Murasu Editor Raja Segar speaking at Tamil Murasu’s 90th Anniversary celebration."}]}

An urban mosaic of love stories, the film weaves four love stories across Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Bangalore into a soulful elegy on intimacy in the new age.\n\nBasu maintains the feel that Life…In a Metro gave its audiences, while updating it with the emotional textures of modern India, such as Gen Z commitment anxieties, millennial career crossroads and the ageism in the dating world – Neena Gupta and Anupam Kher are the industry seniors bringing that story to screen.\n\nBasu’s signature ensemble also includes Sara Ali Khan and Aditya Roy Kapur, Pankaj Tripathi and Konkona Sen Sharma and finally, Ali Faizal and Fatima Sana Sheikh. Pritam’s music, from the hit single “Zamaana Lage” to deeply woven melodies, acts as connective tissue that pieces the film together.

They are Indian students in America – she’s at a small Vermont college, and he’s in New York City. Kiran Desai opens the story to include both Sonia and Sunny’s families, offering a vision of middle class people between partition and 9/11, their struggles with corruption and evolving mores.\n\nThe novel explores love in its many forms – familial, parental, romantic, fraternal, dysfunctional – as well as racism, poverty, class distinctions, American exceptionalism, Indian history, and more.\n\nJatt Baija\n\nAgrita Dhawan, better known as Agsy, is an Indian rapper who is making her name in modern Desi hip-hop.

The song’s lyrics aim to empower women.\n\nThis is the “rawest version of me yet – unfiltered, unshaken, unapologetically loud,” Agsy said.

Others like former public servants Jeffrey Siow, David Neo and Jasmin Lau were seen in the months before the hustings.\n\nPM Wong said he had personally reached out to and persuaded many of the new candidates fielded at the May 3 election. He called on fellow MPs to help scout for and surface names, mentor promising individuals and support their growth.\n\n“As leader of the party, (looking out for good people to join the party) is one of my most important responsibilities. But I cannot do this work alone – I need all of you to chip in,” he said.\n\nHe was speaking at an appreciation dinner for 20 retired MPs held at Parliament House. Around 90 guests were present, including current MPs and the party’s branch chairpersons.\n\nThe PAP traditionally holds this dinner soon after a general election to thank outgoing MPs and set the broad direction for the party.\n\nAt the dinner, PM Wong said the party is seeking people with the right values, who care deeply about Singapore, and who can shoulder the heavy responsibility of public service.\n\n“It has never been easy to find such people and it won’t get easier,” he said.\n\n“Some may express interest in politics, but we need to be sure about their motivations. Others may have the heart to serve, but are not ready for the demands of public life.”\n\nWork for the next general election – which must be called by 2030 – has begun as the party is resuming its tea sessions, said PM Wong. Potential candidates typically go for several rounds of “tea” with senior members of the party.\n\n“We are casting the net wide – across all background and communities. It doesn’t matter that someone disagrees with us or voted against us before,” he said.\n\nThey will be welcome as long as they have the heart to serve and are prepared to make common cause with the PAP, he added.\n\nPM Wong said the party has always known that the quality of candidates matters in elections.\n\nThe recent general election – where the PAP won 65.6 per cent of the vote– showed just how much this matters, he said.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nPresident\n\nLawrence Wong\n\nPAP", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/86ac00dc7ccd9ca1c74ef994b5a780bc29f7b92a0dcb28b71061aa32b998f67b?w=825", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong speaking at an appreciation dinner for 20 retired MPs at Parliament House on July 4."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nPiyush Gupta on retirement, travelling and birdwatching\n\nAfter transforming DBS into one of the world’s most admired digital banks, Mr Piyush Gupta traded spreadsheets for soaring peaks, board meetings for bird watching and financial headlines for viral LinkedIn mix-ups.\n\nSince stepping down as CEO on March 28 this year, after 16 influential years, the India-born Singaporean has embraced a richly personal chapter of life marked by plenty of travel, nature, reflection – and even a mistaken identity in Bali that lit up social media.\n\n“For 12 weeks since I retired, I’ve been travelling 10 weeks,” a fit and relaxed Mr Gupta told tabla! with a smile, in a room next to his office at the Singapore Management University. “April in the Himalayas. May and June in Europe – Sicily, then Ireland.”\n\nThe 65-year-old’s eyes light up when he speaks about the Himalayas, a region he calls “therapeutic”. He hiked through the remote Kinnaur and Parvati Valleys of Himachal Pradesh, places known as much for their serene beauty as their cultural richness.\n\n“I used to do a lot of trekking in Uttarakhand and Himachal in my younger days. Spending a month there unclogs the system. It’s the best way to clear your brain,” said Mr Gupta, who was born in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and grew up in New Delhi.\n\nMr Piyush Gupta enjoying a trek in the Himalayas.\n\nPhoto: Piyush Gupta\n\nHis wife Ruchira joined him on the journey and, for parts of it, close friends went along. “We did 8 to 10km daily hikes,” he said. “It turned out to be a great way to unwind.”\n\nFrom the Himalayas, Mr Gupta journeyed to Sicily, where his children had rented a villa to celebrate his retirement. Then came a road trip through Ireland and a week with his grandchildren in London\n\nHe was also the centre of a Bali story which made him a social media sensation.\n\nSingaporean tour company founder Janney Hujic posted a LinkedIn story about a chance encounter with him at a cafe in Bali. The photo showed a man resembling Mr Gupta.\n\nThe caption praised his wisdom and humility. Except it wasn’t Mr Gupta.\n\nHe replied: “Sorry to disillusion you. That isn’t me!”.\n\nThe man was later identified as Mr Kumar H Subramaniam, a 58-year-old Singaporean living in Bali. He said he told Ms Hujic upfront that he was not Mr Gupta – he’d been mistaken for him before.\n\nThe saga took another turn when Ms Hujic claimed the post was uploaded by a rogue social media manager who demanded $5,000 to take it down.\n\n“When I first saw the post, I was actually quite impressed,” Mr Gupta admitted. “I thought, very clever girl. If someone wanted to do a tongue-in-cheek marketing stunt with a lookalike, that was well done. The backlash came only when she got defensive. If she’d owned it, said four days later, ‘Hey, I pulled this off,’ I would have been fine.”\n\nHe laughed again and said: “Now it’s become an Internet thing. It’s become a meme.”\n\nMr Gupta could have stayed on at DBS until 70 like some American CEOs, but he chose to retire at 65.\n\n“There’s no formal retirement age. In fact, the board wanted me to stay. But during Covid, a WhatsApp circulated, purportedly from a nurse in Australia, talking about regrets of the dying. That stayed with me,” Mr Gupta said.\n\n“I told myself – plan your life like everything else. Don’t wait till it’s too late.”\n\n“As you get older, the biggest premium is time. You have a finite amount. So how do you want to use that time. Then you inevitably come to the conclusion that you must be disciplined and create a plan for how you want to use the time. Who knows how much time you have.”\n\nMr Gupta chairs the Board of Trustees at Singapore Management University and is Chairman of Mandai Park Holdings.\n\n“I love education – that’s why I joined SMU. And Mandai is the best nature platform in Singapore. But, above all, I want to travel. At DBS, long trips were impossible. Now I’m rooted in relationships – with family, with friends – and I finally have the time.”\n\nNext up: birdwatching in Botswana, trekking in Mongolia, and a week in Zambia.\n\n“My calendar is full of places I always wanted to go to. This is why I retired – to finally check off those boxes.”\n\nA lesser-known side of Mr Gupta is his long-standing passion for birdwatching.\n\n“Between age 12 and 17, I was really into birding. I even listed it under ‘Other Interests’ on my CV,” he said. “At my Citibank interview, they grilled me: ‘Why is this relevant to banking?’ I gave them a lot of nonsense about patience and observation.”\n\nHe added with a laugh: “If it were today, I’d talk about biodiversity, ESG and birds as the ultimate survivors from the dinosaur era!”\n\nIn recent years, birding has re-entered his life. “I go out with regular folks – not finance people. And I love it. It gets me out in nature, meeting a totally different crowd. It’s humbling and joyful.”\n\nAsked if he had done enough at DBS or had more to offer, Mr Gupta was thoughtful.\n\n“There’s always more to do. When I joined, I thought 10 years was good. Then came Covid. Then some tech challenges. So I stayed to see it through. But I believe we broke the back of a lot of big issues – not just tech but culture.”\n\nMr Gupta is confident about DBS’s future.\n\n“There’s more ahead – Gen AI, token banking – but DBS is ready. We built agility, resilience, momentum. There is wind in the sails.”\n\nRetirement\n\nBank\n\nPiyush Gupta", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/9257d8090cfac289ad27f277cccc68532a9037baf4884371cd50ac43e5b0ff87?w=825", "alt_text": "Piyush speaks to tabla! on on retirement, travelling and birdwatching."}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nBehind Mr Piyush Gupta’s high-profile role lies a deeply personal journey – one shaped by identity, loyalty and a commitment to make Singapore his true home.\n\nHe has lived in New Delhi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.\n\n“My wife and I asked ourselves where we wanted to retire. And we agreed: Singapore.”\n\nBut it wasn’t just about getting a red passport.\n\n“We had long conversations. Choosing to retire here meant committing to Singapore as our country – heart and soul. We went through a lot of soul-searching. These are not decisions to be taken lightly.”\n\nFor Mr Gupta, Singapore offered a platform to do more – to create impact beyond his own success. “Singapore punches above its weight globally. I felt this would let me punch above mine too,” he said.\n\nOver time, Mr Gupta said, his identity evolved. “Hand on heart, when I started representing DBS on global platforms, I realised I wasn’t just an executive – I was representing Singapore. The Indian and Singaporean positions might differ, but I stood by the Singaporean stance. And I was never conflicted about that.”\n\nOne moment stands out vividly: watching a badminton match between Singapore’s Loh Kean Yew and India’s Kidambi Srikanth.\n\n“And I was cheering for Kean Yew,” Mr Gupta recalled. “That was when I knew my emotions had shifted. Though in cricket, I still root for India – because Singapore doesn’t play at that level!”\n\nHis response to the question “Are you Singaporean or Indian?” is both nuanced and revealing.\n\n“So, you know, there’s some parts of India you can’t erradicate from your system right? First of all, my extended family is there. Your memories are there. Cricket is still my favourite sport. Bollywood, Indian culture.\n\n“But I also spent 35 years out of India. And in my 40s, I consciously made a decision to become Singaporean. Nothing to do with DBS.”\n\nAs DBS expanded into India, Mr Gupta faced criticism from some quarters for opening too many branches there, appearing with Indian icons like Sachin Tendulkar, and sponsoring the Indian badminton team.\n\n“The India strategy wasn’t mine alone – it was board-driven,” he explained. “If you look 50 years ahead, you can’t just rely on city-states. Asia’s growth lies in markets like China, India and Indonesia. India had the digital infrastructure – Aadhaar, India Stack – which made it ideal for digital experiments. When pure digital didn’t work, we pivoted. We built a physical network, acquired Lakshmi Vilas Bank. That was a measured, multi-year, board-supported strategy.”\n\nThe results speak for themselves. “Our India business is now the fastest-growing part of DBS. The timing was right. Today, we have a real platform in India.”\n\nMr Gupta was also drawn into public discourse around the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), which has been unfairly blamed for an influx of Indian professionals.\n\n“Of course, it bothered me,” he admitted. “I looked into the numbers. In 20 years, fewer than 500 people came through that specific CECA clause. Most came through normal work permits. There’s a lot of political spin in the CECA narrative.”\n\nStill, Mr Gupta didn’t dismiss the concerns entirely. Instead, he proposed tangible solutions regarding integration.\n\n“It takes two hands to clap. And the truth is, many of the new Indians are creating their own ghettos. Whether it’s the Orchard Road ghetto or the Changi ghetto.\n\n“But companies have a role too. At DBS, we created onboarding programmes with local buddies, orientation and exposure trips to encourage integration. I shared these ideas with the National Integration Council. It takes effort from both sides.”\n\nDoes he believe he has made Indians proud?\n\n“From my LinkedIn following and the messages I receive, I’d say yes.

Kavi\n\nSakti Singaravelu\n\nIn 1935, Tamil Murasu was launched in colonial Singapore with a mission: to serve the Tamil-speaking community at a time when Tamil voices were peripheral in the public square.\n\nIt has come a long way since then and celebrates its 90th anniversary on July 6. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam will be the guest-of-honour.\n\nFounded by Mr G. Sarangapany, the paper began as a weekly newsletter for the Tamils’ Reform Association and each copy sold for just one cent.\n\nBy its 10th issue, the paper had incurred a loss of $51 but Mr Sarangapany continued. His aim was not to make a large profit but to keep the underserved Tamil community informed on timely local and world news.\n\nHe acquired the paper in 1936 and transformed it from an association bulletin into a proper newspaper. Under his editorial leadership, the paper flourished and was the highest-selling Tamil newspaper across Singapore and Malaysia in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1952, the publication even launched a student edition titled Manavar Murasu to inspire and nurture the next generation of Tamil writers.\n\nHowever, the paper’s fortunes reversed after Mr Sarangapany’s demise in 1974. His wife, Mdm Lim Boon Neo, and their sons Jayaram and Balaram, ran the paper for the next 19 years.\n\nTheir unfamiliarity with the language and lack of experience in the newspaper industry marked a turbulent chapter in the publication’s history.\n\nSales declined due to poor circulation and unreliable vendors, while the staff were severely underpaid.\n\nThe paper came close to being shut down before it was bought by Singapore Press Holdings in 1995.\n\nMdm P. Thenmozhi, an executive sub-editor at Tamil Murasu, joined in 1991 as a publication assistant. She worked on Manavar Murasu for 10 years and then spent another ten as a reporter.\n\n“For the first twenty years, any salary increases we received were minimal,” she said in Tamil.\n\nMdm K. Kanagalatha joined Tamil Murasu in 1989 as a part-time intern. She did stories for Manavar Murasu and did reporting for many years before becoming an associate editor.\n\n“The vendors would sell the papers but wouldn’t pay us what they owed. Sometimes, trying to collect the money almost led to fights,” Mdm Kanagalatha said.\n\n“Yet, none of the staff left or demanded much because we were all passionate about the language. We thought of it less like a job and more like a family business.”\n\nSince the 1960s, Tamil Murasu operated out of a two-storey building at 139-141 Lavender Street, which was owned by Mr Sarangapany’s family.\n\nThe newspapers were printed onsite using a Linotype printing machine on the first floor, where the compositors and sub-editors worked, while the chief editor and accountant were based on the second floor.\n\nMr A.S. Kunalan joined Tamil Murasu in 1990 as a sub-editor and is currently the chief sub-editor.\n\nHe explained that a typesetter arranges text for printing and, before computerisation, the paper used metal typesetting by engraving letter moulds to design its pages.\n\n“There were boxes holding metal types for all 247 Tamil letters. The compositors were so experienced they didn’t need to look up, their hands would instinctively find the right letters and arrange them on the page,” said Mr Kunalan.\n\nHe had worked as a typewriting instructor in Chennai and is the main man responsible for the publication’s digital shift, Mdm Kanagalatha said.\n\nFrom left: Mr A.S. Kunalan, Mdm P. Thenmozhi and Mdm K. Kanagalatha.\n\nPhoto: T. Kavi\n\nWhen Tamil Murasu moved to 1 Genting Lane in 1991 and switched from using MS-DOS (Disk Operating System) to Windows 3.1, Mr Kunalan tested out various publishing softwares to modernise the paper’s typesetting process.\n\n“Before Adobe InDesign, there was Aldus PageMaker. I tested it at home before introducing it to the office. I was able to print out an A3 page that was fully digitally laid out,” he said.\n\nMdm Thenmozhi said: “Mr Kunalan taught me and the compositors how to type in Tamil.” With their combined efforts, Tamil Murasu successfully published its first fully computer-printed issue on July 6, 1991.\n\nThat same year Singapore Press Holdings took over distribution of the paper and later acquired it as one of its subsidiaries in 1995, resolving the publication’s long-standing issues with poor circulation and underpaid salaries.\n\nWith greater resources, Tamil Murasu has continued to push the boundaries of vernacular journalism by expanding its social media reach, upgrading newsroom technology and keeping the Tamil community informed, connected and engaged.\n\nFrom left: Mr A.S.

But survival, especially in a fast-changing media landscape, has always required more than just loyalty to tradition. It requires metamorphosis, which has always been in Tamil Murasu’s DNA.\n\nAs early as 1940, it began publishing news in English on one of its pages. That same year, founder G. Sarangapany launched The Indian Daily Mail, an Englis daily that ran until it was halted in 1941 due to wartime restrictions. After a brief post-war revival, it folded in 1956. In 1999, Tamil Murasu experimented with a weekly bilingual page again – a subtle but telling effort to expand.\n\nAs Tamil Murasu marks its 90th anniversary on July 6, it has successfully expanded and evolved. One sign of that evolution came in 2008, with the launch of tabla!, a bold English weekly newspaper.\n\nWhat began as a single English page in Tamil Murasu soon grew into a weekly, and eventually a central pillar of a broader effort – to integrate and amplify the voices of all Indian communities in Singapore, not just Tamil speakers.\n\ntabla! gave a platform to those who had long existed on the edges of Singapore’s media narrative, offering stories in a language they understood with a cultural lens they recognised.\n\nNow, with its own standalone website and a growing digital presence, tabla! is capturing the daily pulse of Singapore’s South Asian communities – no longer just weekly, but in real time. Its mission is expansive but focused: to be a mirror, a bridge and a mouthpiece.\n\nThis transformation didn’t come from the top, but from within the newsroom itself, guided by the journalists who understood the community’s shifting needs. Most Tamil Murasu reporters are bilingual, moving fluidly between Tamil and English.\n\nTo make the paper even more inclusive, Tamil Murasu has been using AI-generated English summaries for its Tamil-language articles – a small technological step, but a helpful one. It signals a core belief that language should never be a barrier to access, understanding or participation.\n\nAnd yet, even in its evolution, Tamil Murasu continues to celebrate its linguistic and cultural roots, while embracing the diversity of the broader Indian diaspora. This dual identity is what has allowed it to thrive in an era when many  papers have faded into obsolescence.\n\nIn many ways, the story of Tamil Murasu and tabla! is the story of Singapore itself: multilingual, multicultural and quietly radical in its commitment to inclusion. For the editors, journalists and readers who have shaped its journey, the goal remains unchanged – to reflect the community in all its complexity, in whichever language it speaks.\n\nAt 90, Tamil Murasu is not just surviving, it’s speaking more voices than ever.\n\nSingapore\n\nIndian", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/897bab738197c3e3fd6c4653e8ef3303d46328325bdf46aa24ca06cde5dd19f9?w=825", "alt_text": "Team Tabla in 2008."}]}

Nixon was eventually forced to resign.\n\nYoung and impressionable, I, too, wanted to make a difference, and several years later applied to join The Straits Times (ST).\n\nA written test was followed by a field assignment and an anxious one-month wait.\n\nThen the letter that would change my life arrived – albeit late.\n\nOn March 2 1981, a despatch rider showed  up at my home bearing my letter of appointment.\n\nBut it was already past 11am and I was to have had a meeting with the ST editor at 10am that day.\n\nIt was customary in those days for all the new hires to have an introductory meeting with the editor on the first day, before starting work.\n\nI rushed to Times House in Kim Seng Road, near River Valley Road, expecting the worst. The editor was not around but he had left a clear message for me: If this was my attitude on the first day of work, then I need not bother showing up anymore.\n\nThe administrative glitch was later explained to him and I was able to embark peacefully on my journalistic career.\n\nMy plan was to learn the ropes on the Sports desk for a year or two, then transfer to the News desk to do crime and investigative reporting.\n\nBut within a year of my joining, Mr SR Nathan, later to become Singapore’s sixth President, arrived at Times House.\n\nHe left as permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to become Executive Chairman of the Straits Times Press (STP) which also produced New Nation, The Business Times (BT) and Berita Harian.\n\nIt was an uneasy and uncertain time for management and journalists in Times House. Most saw it as the start of direct government intervention in the media. I felt it was not the time to be asking for a move to become an investigative reporter.\n\nIn his memoirs, Mr Nathan devoted an entire chapter – Entering the newspaper world – to his time in Times House.\n\nThis sentence in particular,  struck me when I read it years later.\n\n“Everyone wanted to be a Woodward or a Bernstein,” Mr Nathan noted in his memoirs, An Unexpected Journey.\n\nEarlier in the chapter he recounted: “As I walked to the door of his office, the prime minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) called me back. I remember his words: “Nathan – I am giving you the Straits Times. It has 150 years of history. It has been a good paper. It is like a bowl of china. If you break it, I can piece it together. But it will never be the same again. Try not to destroy it.”\n\nMr Nathan spent six years in Times House. During that time, there were two mergers in the newspaper industry.\n\nIn 1983, a rival newspaper company, Singapore News and Publications Limited (SNPL), was formed. It brought about a major consolidation of the Chinese newspapers, with the new company being given a licence to publish an English daily, the Singapore Monitor.\n\nAs part of the restructure, New Nation, an afternoon tabloid, was closed and STP and was given a licence to publish a Chinese newspaper, Shin Min Daily News. The closure of New Nation led to a loss of jobs.\n\nThen another merger a year later.\n\nTo save on costs, STP, Times Publishing and SNPL merged and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), a public listed company, was born in 1984. More than 100 journalists, some wearing black armbands and others carrying placards, stood in the rain during lunch hour at Times House to protest against the proposed merger. “Competition is good for Singapore,”  they argued in one of their banners.\n\nThe Singapore Monitor folded the following year due to financial constraints. Once again, journalists were retrenched, though some were taken back by ST and BT.\n\nOver the years, other newspapers came and went – projecteyeball, Streats, the bilingual My Paper and the Chinese language Lianhe Wanbao. TV stations were started and closed before the challenge of radio was taken on.\n\nMr Nathan was replaced some time later by Mr Lim Kim San, a formidable no-nonsense former minister who had built up public housing after Singapore’s independence.\n\nUnder Mr Lim’s leadership, SPH pivoted to properties to shore up earnings.\n\nWith the passage of time, it was business as usual at Times House where the newspapers were also printed and distributed. If you hung around till ST went to print past midnight, you could see it coming off the presses with your story in it – literally hot off the press. It was at Times House that I met my wife, fellow journalist Chitra Rajaram. Times House was later sold to a condominium developer.\n\nI did eventually move to other desks – News, Sunday Times and Section Two (now called Life!) – before returning to Sports.\n\nReporting was fun. I met people from all walks of life and wrote their stories.\n\nThere were no handphones in those days. We were given pagers and used coinafons to ring the office. We used electric typewriters and carried manual ones on overseas assignments.\n\nMy starting salary was about $350 a month. Payment was in cash at the cashier’s office and the money – notes and coins – came in little brown envelopes.\n\nAfter 10 years in ST, it was time to move on. I asked for a transfer to The New Paper (TNP).\n\nLaunched in 1988, TNP was not unlike New Nation, selling mainly on crime and football.\n\nIt was there that I learnt the production side of journalism – sub-editing, copyediting and page design.\n\nIt was a tough shift. We started work at 5.30am so that the afternoon tabloid could catch the lunchtime crowd.\n\nUnlike ST, which sold largely through subscriptions, TNP was a “street paper” sold at newstands, convenience stores and MRT stations.\n\nAt its peak, it sold more then 100,000 copies a day. If the story was juicy enough, people would queue to buy the paper. We sold fewer papers on the days when it rained at lunch time.\n\nEvery day, the team had to produce an impactful cover story and design to grab the readers’ attention. And we always had to make sure our stories had a different angle or spin from what ST had.\n\nIt helped that the newsroom had many talented editors and journalists. It was a crucible of creativity.\n\nWe dabbled in quick news and info-graphics, led by an editor who encouraged out-of-the-box story ideas and who was inclined, from time to time, to test the story boundaries or OB (out of bounds) markers as we called it in the business.\n\nSeveral years later, I became the Crime Desk supervisor and, in a way, achieved what I had set out to do. No Watergate-type stories though.\n\nTNP was ahead of its time. And it was a sad day when the print version folded in 2022, a victim of the digital tsunami that swept through the media world, crippling newspapers. Subscriptions and advertising revenue plunged.\n\nAfter 14 years in TNP, it was time to move again.\n\nI had wanted to return to ST but was asked to join Tamil Murasu (TM) instead in 2006.\n\nThe newspaper was in danger of closing when SPH stepped in and bought it in 1995. It celebrates its 90th anniversary on July 6.\n\nWhat was to have been a six-month secondment turned out to be a 19-year stay in TM and tabla! They were good years.\n\nIn 2021, as part of another restructure, SPH Media was formed, operating under a not-for-profit structure and receiving funding from the goverment.\n\nThe media scene has changed dramatically with the rise of digital journalism and alternative media.\n\nDuring the General Election in May, mainstream and alternative media battled for eyeballs using social media, videos and podcasts.\n\nIt’s a vastly different media world from the one I stepped into all those decades ago.\n\nI have lived through the changes. And now it’s time to move on.\n\nRetirement", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/8f73ed7dde63b4fe15959b80db991e8f78a9eeb4540828dffd8b280f5346819f?w=825", "alt_text": "Staff gather for a group shot outside the Times House building at 390, Kim Seng Road, before moving to News Centre at Toa Payoh North in 2002."}]}

Through the power of Bitcoin, we now have a beautiful island near Singapore where we’re building the Network School.”\n\nParticipants describe the experience as a real-world experiment in nation-building, with daily workouts, workshops and community-building activities.\n\nAccording to Mr Srinivasan, the school seeks “dark talent” – individuals with unconventional backgrounds but strong potential for leadership, innovation and impact.\n\n“We’re building a win-and-help-win culture,” he said, emphasising values of self-improvement, health and decentralised learning.\n\nMr Srinivasan is known for his influential roles in Silicon Valley. A Stanford PhD, he co-founded Counsyl, a genetic testing company, and served as CTO of Coinbase, reported the Economic Times.\n\nHe was also a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and an early investor in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto ventures. His 2022 book The Network State outlined a future where digital communities evolve into sovereign entities.\n\nCritics have questioned the feasibility and ethics of private nation-building, with some calling the vision utopian or elitist. However, Mr Srinivasan insists the movement is not about exclusion but about pioneering new models of governance and community in a hyperconnected world.\n\nThe Network School is intended as the first of many.\n\nMr Srinivasan has announced future locations in cities like Dubai, Tokyo and Miami, each forming part of a global network of digitally united communities with ambitions of physical presence and international legitimacy.\n\nTechnology", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/841ce15c2c69e82865b39d9a4d6306c1aa04f01a2c2a160789d9dd214a713670?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian-American tech visionary Balaji Srinivasan."}]}

I’m always looking for challenges, and Maalik gave me that chance,” he said at the trailer launch in Mumbai on July 1. The film explores the journey of a man determined to become a “maalik” – a master of his own destiny – despite being born with nothing.\n\nJoining Rajkummar is Manushi Chhillar, who plays Shalini, his love interest. “It’s a de-glam role that people didn’t expect me in,” said Manushi. “I’m grateful Pulkit trusted me with this character. The film has been a big learning experience.”\n\nThe ensemble cast includes veteran actors Saurabh Shukla, Saurabh Sachdeva, Swanand Kirkire and Bengali superstar Prosenjit Chatterjee, who plays a gritty cop.\n\n“Working with Rajkummar, my younger brother, was a joy. He’s immensely talented,” Prosenjit said, calling the opportunity to join the cast a “no-brainer.”\n\nMaalik explores themes of power, loyalty and survival in a gritty underworld where ambition can cost everything.\n\nThe trailer opens with Rajkumma’s injured character vowing to rise above his station and become the “maalik” of his fate. It quickly escalates into a tense showdown between Rajkummar and Shukla’s characters, highlighting the film’s intense action sequences and political undertones.\n\nPulkit, who previously collaborated with Rajkummar on the series Bose: Dead/Alive, brings a stylised realism to the film. “It’s a commercial film, but it’s grounded. There’s dialogue, intense drama and emotional depth,” said Rajkummar.\n\nProduced by Kumar Taurani of Tips Films and Jay Shewakramani of Northern Lights Films, Maalik also features a special cameo by Huma Qureshi in the song Dil Thaam Ke.\n\nThe film releases in theatres on July 11, and early fan reactions to the trailer have been overwhelmingly positive, praising Rajkummar’s transformation and the film’s gritty visual style.\n\nBollywood", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/f3c67ca37f705848063d3024704cf0d26c91a0634e4e9fed78f186912f1028ef?w=825", "alt_text": "Actor Saurabh Shukla during the trailer launch of Maalik in Mumbai on July 1."}]}

It can change with a single game, so I’m not thinking about it too much,” he told reporters. “For me, winning the UzChess Cup meant more. I take things one tournament at a time.”\n\nHis strong performance in Tashkent, including a crucial win over Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abdusattorov, lifted his rating to 2778.3 – just ahead of Gukesh (2776.6) and Erigaisi (2775.7).\n\nThe win also extended his lead in the 2025 FIDE Circuit, putting him in a strong position to qualify for the 2026 Candidates Tournament.\n\nPraggnanandhaa credits a shift in mindset for his recent success. “I’ve changed how I approach the game mentally. I’ve become more confident and more resilient in tough situations,” he said.\n\nThat attitude was evident in Tashkent, where he bounced back from two consecutive losses to beat Erigaisi and Abdusattorov, eventually winning the event in a dramatic tie-break.\n\nThe teenager’s tie-break prowess has been a recurring theme this year. He triumphed in blitz deciders at Tata Steel and the Superbet Classic, defeating top names like Gukesh, Alireza Firouzja and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave.\n\nLooking ahead, Praggnanandhaa has a packed schedule, including stops at the Grand Chess Tour in Croatia, Sinquefield Cup in the United States and the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.\n\nHe will represent Team Liquid at the latter, joining chess greats Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana. “It’s exciting to see chess included in Esports.

Santosh Kumar\n\nAt 19, while most of his peers juggle academics, smartphones and social media, Indian teenager Sahil Jha is pedalling across continents – quite literally – to raise awareness about one of the planet’s most pressing but overlooked crises: soil degradation.\n\nOn March 21, Sahil embarked on an ambitious solo journey spanning 20,000 kilometres and 20 countries, starting in Bundaberg, Australia. His destination? Global consciousness. His mission? To spotlight the critical issue of soil extinction and urge governments to act before it’s too late.\n\nBetween June 26 and 29, Sahil, who hails from Kolkata, was in Singapore as part of this epic odyssey. In four packed days, he met diplomats, addressed the media and spoke with students, policymakers and environmental advocates.\n\nHis engagements included meetings with the ambassadors of Australia and Chile, diplomats from Cambodia and New Zealand, and a community outreach event co-hosted by the Indian High Commission.\n\nAt Isha Yoga Centre in Ang Mo Kio, he addressed a gathering attended by India’s Deputy High Commissioner Pooja Tillu.\n\nHe also conducted an awareness session at Temasek Polytechnic, participated in a symbolic cycling event through key landmarks, and used his growing social media platform to amplify local stories tied to soil health.\n\n“Singapore was phenomenal,” he said. “The level of engagement, from students to diplomats, was inspiring. Every conversation is a step closer to making soil a mainstream issue.”\n\nSahil’s mission stems from a sense of spiritual and ecological responsibility.\n\nInspired by the Save Soil movement initiated by spiritual leader Sadhguru, he first cycled 15,000km across India at age 16. That journey touched over 250 institutions and garnered over 300 media features. Now, having seen the deteriorating condition of soil across India, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, he’s sounding the alarm globally.\n\n“Soil isn’t just dirt beneath our feet – it’s the foundation of our food, water and climate systems,” he said. “When I visit farmlands, I see dry, lifeless soil devoid of earthworms and microorganisms. The food grown in such soil has no taste, no nutrients, and, in some cases, toxins.”\n\nBacked by crowdfunding and supported by organisations like Adani Sportsline, Sahil’s journey combines grit, discipline and advocacy.\n\nHe cycles 50km to 70km a day, stopping in cities to meet with farmers, political leaders, students and NGOs.\n\n“Each conversation matters,” he said. “I ask leaders to prioritise soil health in national policy – incentivising farmers to increase organic content in soil from 1 per cent to 3-6 per cent is a vital step.”\n\nSahil rides a Surly-branded geared touring bicycle that has clocked thousands of kilometres without a single flat tyre – a testament to the preparation and endurance required for his solo voyage.\n\nBut the journey is more than physical. “I follow a strict fitness and mindfulness routine,” he says. “The biggest challenge is staying mentally resilient across unfamiliar terrains, weather and visa hurdles.”\n\nHe is also pursuing his Year 12 studies online while on the road. “Education can’t wait, but neither can the soil,” he quips.\n\nSahil’s campaign is part of a larger wave of environmental action driven by youth, but what sets him apart is his singular focus and tangible results.\n\n“We’ve already seen impact,” he noted. “India launched a national mission for natural farming with significant investment. The EU is debating a soil monitoring law. China has initiated its first National Soil Survey in 40 years. The conversation is happening – we just need to keep pushing before it’s too late.”\n\nAccording to UNESCO, nearly 90 per cent of Earth’s land surface could be degraded by 2050 if current trends continue. This would slash food production by 40 per cent, exacerbate climate change and trigger conflicts over food and water. “This is not a far-off crisis,” Sahil warned. “It’s already here, hidden beneath our feet.”\n\nHe believes youth hold the key. “Use your smartphones, use your voices,” he urged young Singaporeans. “Talk about soil on social media. Demand policy change. If soil becomes your priority, it will become your leaders’ priority too.”\n\nFrom Singapore, Sahil headed to Malaysia. He will then move on to Europe, the UK and North America. His campaign will continue with school visits, stakeholder engagements and media outreach.\n\nHis ultimate goal is to build a global coalition of changemakers – individuals, institutions and governments – that will treat soil health not just as an environmental issue, but a public survival imperative.\n\nAs he left Singapore on his way to the next leg of his journey, Sahil summed up his drive with clarity and calm: “This mission isn’t just about soil. It’s about saving our future. And if I can pedal one conversation into a policy shift, it’s all worth it.”\n\n“Talk about soil on social media. Demand policy change. If soil becomes your priority, it will become your leaders’ priority too.”\n\nSahil Jha\n\nSports", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/0fadaaf90e340983c8cab7b4c50bc9f76bf3902cf901af92eeb00a82e01c3554?w=825", "alt_text": "Sahil Jha during his visit to Singapore"}]}

However, it also poses as a lesson in how fashion can both romanticise and commodify the mundane. In this case, commodifying South Asian trademarks.\n\nThe fashion show that featured the collection was a deliberate attempt at cross-continental storytelling – not just in form, but in spirit.\n\nThe set included a reimagining of the ancient Indian game snakes and ladders, the soundtrack wove in Punjabi beats, including an original song titled “Yaara” composed by A.R. Rahman and creative director Pharell Williams, and models sashayed down a runway with a backdrop that evoked Delhi’s warmth more than Parisian cool.\n\nYet it is the autorickshaw bag that has stirred the most conversation.“Middle-class struggle is now luxury,” said a netizen, while another joked, “If I see a South Delhi aunty stepping out of her Audi with this, I’ll riot.”\n\nThe autorickshaw, in South Asia, is a symbol of modest survival – the transportation of the masses. To see it gilded in Vuitton’s iconography, priced in the thousands, S$52,000 to be exact, and destined for glass-shelved boutiques in London or Seoul, raises the inevitable question: Is this homage or appropriation?\n\nThe answer isn’t simple. Williams’ team did conduct extensive research in India, collaborating with design studios in Mumbai and visiting craft centers in Delhi and Jodhpur.\n\nThe collection seems to appreciate Indian culture more than appropriate, as it appears to have been created with a studied hand, featuring elements that are emblematic of India, from opulent chess sets to Indian textile motifs.\n\nThe same cannot be said about Prada, another luxury brand that recently revealed its menswear collection with Kolhapuri chappals, the layman’s choice of footwear in India. Punching down and cashing in on a former British colony’s culture without credit is simply in bad taste.\n\nHowever, that does not mean Louis Vuitton is completely innocent. Sincerity does not neutralise the power dynamics at play. Luxury fashion, by its nature, is about elevation – of materials, of stories, of value. When the aesthetic of the everyday is rendered in calfskin and gold zippers, the transformation is no longer neutral.\n\nPerhaps that’s the point. Louis Vuitton’s autorickshaw bag is not meant to be carried so much as discussed. It joins a lineage of playful, sculptural bags by Louis Vuitton – lizards, sharks, and now, autorickshaws.\n\nBut in turning the hyperlocal into the hyperluxurious, it reveals the paradox of global fashion today, which is a desire to celebrate other cultures, paired with an instinct to control how that celebration is seen, sold, and worn. The irony should not be lost on Williams that the autorickshaw bag he designed is utterly inaccessible to the millions of people who actually commute by autorickshaws on a daily basis.\n\nAt the end of the day, the bag is a metaphor on wheels – a rolling contradiction between authenticity and artifice. Like fashion itself, it transports us. The only question is – who gets to ride?\n\nFashion\n\nControversy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/5c6f898069128f4aa0e3c24d115c9ed0ff83ffd9677c66e5072ee7c2e67caa8c?w=825", "alt_text": "Louis Vuitton SS26 autorickshaw bag."}]}

That evening, she consumed leftover food before collapsing around 10.30pm, reported the Hindustan Times.\n\nAccording to Tyagi, he had stepped out of their Mumbai residence to walk their dog when he received a call from the house help alerting him that Shefali had fainted. He immediately rushed back upstairs in the elevator, while the domestic aide went down to tend to their elderly pet.\n\nTyagi found Shefali unresponsive but with a pulse. Her eyes would not open, and her body appeared lifeless.\n\nHe rushed her to Bellevue Multispeciality Hospital in Andheri, where doctors declared her dead on arrival.\n\nMumbai Police arrived at the hospital before midnight and recorded statements from her husband, relatives, friends and household staff. The post-mortem was conducted at R N Cooper Hospital in Juhu, and initial findings indicated a heart attack.\n\nThe autopsy was video recorded, and as per protocol, viscera samples were preserved and sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Kalina for further analysis, which may take up to three months.\n\nClose friend and industry colleague Pooja Ghai, who spoke to entertainment journalist Vickey Lalwani, recounted Tyagi’s version of events.\n\nShe described his visible grief and said her only fear was that he might be unjustly suspected. “Parag was grieving, but the police were naturally doing their duty. My only hope was that he wouldn’t be dragged into a prolonged investigation, like others have been in the past. Thankfully, there was no foul play, and he was released,” she said.\n\nPooja added that Shefali had taken a Vitamin-C IV drip earlier that day, which she had done occasionally before. Though these drips are promoted as skin-boosting and popular in places like Dubai, questions are now being raised about the safety of using such treatments without medical supervision.\n\n“Shefali was very conscious of her health. She never took chances with her food or medications,” Pooja insisted.\n\nDespite her cautious nature, investigators found various cosmetic and wellness products at her home – including glutathione vials, anti-ageing supplements, skin-glow tablets, and other vitamin products – many of which are not prescription-based but could pose risks if taken without supervision or on an empty stomach.\n\nSources within the hospital and police suggest Shefali’s collapse may have been triggered by severely low blood pressure, possibly due to the fast and the medications, reported NDTV. This is also being investigated as a potential contributing factor to her cardiac arrest.\n\nShefali’s mother, overwhelmed with grief, had to be hospitalised the following day, while Tyagi was described as being in a state of emotional shock.\n\nThere is currently no evidence of foul play or external harm. However, authorities have taken statements from family members and the house staff to reconstruct the final hours of the actress’s life.\n\nHer death has triggered broader conversations within the industry and among the public about the dangers of unsupervised health treatments and the pressure many celebrities face to maintain a certain image.\n\nShefali’s death has left her fans and colleagues shocked.\n\nShe first rose to national fame at just 20 years old through her appearance in the music video Kaanta Laga, which became a cultural sensation.\n\nThough she didn’t replicate that level of success again, she remained in the public eye through reality TV appearances and select acting roles, and had built a loyal following on social media.\n\nHer funeral took place on June 28 after the body was released to the family. Meanwhile, police have assured that a detailed report will be prepared once the toxicology and forensic results are available.\n\n“Shefali was very conscious of her health.

Santosh Kumar\n\nMr Gupta is a big admirer of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and spoke candidly about three memorable meetings with Singapore’s founding father.\n\n“The person who inspired me the most, I never worked with. It was Lee Kuan Yew. I was a big fan of what he was able to do to this tiny country.”\n\nHe read Mr Lee’s books and was struck by how someone with a sense of purpose and a willingness to think differently could achieve such great success.\n\n“I asked him cheekily, ‘Why don’t you go and run my country, India?’” Mr Gupta recalled with a smile of his first meeting with Mr Lee. “He thought and then he laughed and said, ‘Even God can’t run your country!’”\n\nThat encounter set the tone for what would be a profound relationship built on respect. Their second meeting, just after the 2011 Singapore elections, addressed a more serious issue – immigration.\n\n“I asked him about all the noise surrounding immigration,” Mr Gupta said. “And he told me, ‘If Singapore does not stay open, we are dead. He said, this is what makes America different.’”\n\nWhen Mr Gupta pressed further, asking why the government didn’t take a more vocal stance, Mr Lee gave a sharp response.\n\n“He thumped the table and said, ‘It’s not my government. It’s my son’s government.”\n\nBut it was their final meeting that Mr Gupta recalls as most revealing. He asked Mr Lee what he would have done differently with hindsight.\n\n“He said, ‘I would have brought Formula One to Singapore sooner.’ I was surprised. Of all things?” Mr Gupta said.\n\nMr Lee then explained that he had initially rejected F1, thinking it had no place in Singapore. But he later realised he was wrong and that building a country wasn’t just about infrastructure but about focusing on other aspects too.\n\nThough banking was his calling, Mr Gupta had a brief, surreal taste of celebrity. While Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra were filming Don 2 in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Gupta – then the Citibank country head in Malaysia – was invited to the shoot.\n\n“We talked for a bit – he’s five years younger than me and from my school, St Columba’s in Delhi,” Mr Gupta said. “But soon, there were two Malaysian Indian guys there.”\n\n“So Shah Rukh said, okay, let me just give them the autograph, then we can continue the conversation. So they come, they walk past Shah Rukh Khan, come to me and say, Mr Piyush, can we get a picture?”\n\n“I call it my Andy Warhol moment, you know, 15 minutes of fame,” he said with a laugh.\n\nHe also found inspiration in Alibaba’s Jack Ma.\n\n“I only met him once, but I got great ideas from that one conversation. It helped us shape our approach to financial services.”\n\nMr Gupta is a firm believer in the value of institutional memory. Early in his DBS tenure, he reached out to Mr S. Dhanabalan, former DBS chairman and one of Singapore’s most respected public servants.\n\n“Dhana was instrumental in shaping DBS. I met him a few times over lunch to understand the psyche and history of the bank,” Mr Gupta said.\n\n“I wanted to learn how the country thought about DBS and how the bank thought about itself.”\n\nHe also sought advice from Mr S. Chandra Das and other senior members of Singapore’s Indian community.\n\n“I wanted to understand the cultural and political landscape. How do I navigate as an Indian in Singapore? What should I be mindful of?”\n\nRetirement\n\nPiyush Gupta", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/7f8ef31321950090774ce84cde6da89ef57801b802fce4f4ed3404d8ea8acf7c?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

Santosh Kumar\n\nAt the heart of Mr Gupta’s leadership journey lies a deep-rooted value: staying grounded.\n\n“I gave a commencement speech at NUS years ago on staying rooted,” he recalled. “It’s easy in my position to lose sight of yourself – hobnobbing with presidents, flying first class. But you must remember the kid who grew up playing cricket in the neighborhood. A lot of what happens in life is kismet (destiny in Urdu). So, if you stay humble, you treat everyone – tea lady or security guard – with the same respect.”\n\nThis ethos of relatability shone brightly in his final days at DBS which has 43,000 employees. A video of his emotional farewell went viral, showing hundreds of staff cheering and crying as Mr Gupta made his way through the lobby.\n\n“When I came out of the lift, I was stunned. It was like an amphitheatre of people.I started crying. I could see people crying around me and I can say, obviously you touched people enough for them to want to do this.”\n\nDespite leading one of Asia’s largest banks, Mr Gupta never let work dominate his personal life. His secret? A disciplined, almost binary compartmentalisation of his mind.\n\n“My brain is wired to switch modes. I don’t carry work home,” he explained. “When I walk through my front door, work switches off and family life switches on.”\n\nThat clarity helped him stay present as a father to two children, now bankers themselves – his daughter, 36, at Barclays in London and his son, 33, at JP Morgan in New York.\n\n“They grew up across South-east Asia – Jakarta, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Despite all the moves, I made time for parenting. I played golf, badminton, spent time with friends – and I was always there for the kids.”\n\nBut being compartmentalised has its quirks.\n\n“My wife knows not to tell me things when I’m at work,” he joked. “If she wants me to remember, she tells my secretary.”\n\nOne of the more striking things about Mr Gupta is his responsiveness. For someone who’s navigated billion-dollar decisions, his e-mails are always prompt – even to seemingly trivial queries.\n\n“I follow the urgent-versus-important rule,” he said. “Urgent things that require quick replies, I do right away. The important, complex stuff – I park it until I have time to read, think and respond thoughtfully. But if it’s instinctive, I get back in minutes.”\n\nHe attributes this not just to discipline, but a desire to stay current and accessible.\n\nFood, like family and work, has also evolved for Mr Gupta. While his Indian roots are strong, his culinary heart now lies in South-east Asia.\n\n“I prefer pepper crab – though I like the chilli crab sauce with the mantou bun,” he said. “I like Peranakan food. I like Malay cuisine. I love beef rendang. It’s one of my favourite dishes.”\n\nAnd his kids? “They’ll go miles for South-east Asian food. Not so much for Indian,” he said with a laugh.\n\nRetirement\n\nPiyush Gupta", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/cea4237115430fd6ddd2d1f5bc939f629aac142e08e24c66cdb5b4cb4ec3181d?w=825", "alt_text": null}]}

(File Photo)\n\nAFP\n\nA 27-year-old woman died by suicide in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, reportedly due to torture over dowry by her husband and in-laws. The deceased, Ridhanya, was the daughter of Annadurai, who runs a garment company.\n\nShe married 28-year-old Kavin Kumar in April this year. According to media reports, the marriage involved a dowry of 800 grams of gold jewellery and a Volvo car worth over S$ 100,000.\n\nOn her way home from the temple on Sunday, she reportedly stopped her car and consumed fumigant pesticide tablets. Locals alerted the police after noticing a car parked in the area for a suspiciously long time. Upon inspection, police found Ridhanya dead inside, foaming at her mouth.\n\nAccording to sources, she had sent seven audio messages on WhatsApp to her father before her death, in which she apologised for her decision and spoke about being unable to bear the alleged abuse.\n\n“I’m unable to bear their mental torture daily. I don’t know whom to tell about this. Those who listen want me to compromise claiming life will be like this only and are not able to understand my suffering,” she said in one of the messages. In another, she reportedly insinuated that the marriage was orchestrated by the family to benefit monetarily from dowry.\n\n“I don’t want to be a burden to you all my life. This time I did not make any mistake. I don’t like this life. They are assaulting me mentally while he is torturing me physically,” she stated in a message, “I don’t like this life. I’m unable to continue my life.”\n\n“You and mom are my world. Until my last breath you have been my hope, but I hurt you badly. You are unable to openly say this still you are not able to see me like this. I can understand your suffering. I’m sorry father everything is over. I’m leaving,” she said.\n\nRidhanya’s body was sent to the District Government Hospital for a post-mortem examination. Outside the hospital, grieving relatives gathered, demanding justice. Her father, Annadurai, accused the groom’s family of deceiving them by pretending to be respectable.\n\n“They cheated us by saying they were a good family,” he said, as he recounted the repeated physical and mental abuse his daughter endured. “You would tear up if you hear what she said,” he told reporters, visibly distraught.\n\nAnnadurai shared that Ridhanya had returned to her parents’ home just 15 days after her wedding. However, he advised her to adjust to the new environment. But within 20 days of returning to her in-laws’ house, Ridhanya came back once more – this time even more broken, he said.\n\nPolice have registered a case and arrested her husband Kavin Kumar, father-in-law Eswamoorthy and mother-in-law Chitradevi.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage on social media, with widespread condemnation of the violence Ridhanya faced. Users are calling for strict action and highlighting how, despite dowry being illegal in India, it remains a deeply rooted and dangerous practice that continues to destroy lives.\n\nIndia\n\nIndian", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/e80dd92fe9e36a2d00ff10c96e2430786ebb56f6c58cf53a1f694c23a202e5a4?w=825", "alt_text": "Indian police officers investigating a case.

But some states such as Karnataka have begun taking their own measures.\n\nKarnataka’s Bill, the strictest of its kind yet, stipulates that those posting “fake news” and “anti-feminist” content, or “promoting superstition”, would face imprisonment along with potential fines.\n\nThe 11-page Karnataka Mis-Information And Fake News (Prohibition) Bill does not define such offences in practice, but said special courts and a regulatory committee would be set up to implement it.\n\nFree speech advocates have cited what they say would be the risk of selective enforcement arising from Karnataka’s measure, and flagged concerns that people posting memes or making honest mistakes online could be prosecuted.\n\n“Misinformation is fairly subjective and every person who uses the internet is susceptible to falling within the dragnet of this law,” said Mr Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based digital advocacy group which first made the Karnataka draft legislation public.\n\nThe state government of Karnataka, home to the city of Bengaluru that hosts the offices or branches of many Indian and foreign tech giants, has said the Bill will be released for public consultation before implementation.\n\nMr Priyank Kharge, Karnataka’s information technology minister, said on June 27 “there is a lot of misinformation on the proposed Misinformation Bill in public”.\n\nHe later added that the “sole objective is to address the growing digital information disorder” and the government’s focus was to tackle misinformation and fake news, “and nothing beyond that”.\n\nHe did not immediately respond to Reuters calls seeking further comment on June 30.\n\nKarnataka’s move could risk creating multiple regulations imposing conflicting obligations and regulatory challenges for companies, said Mr Aman Taneja, partner at law and policy firm Ikigai.\n\nSome Indian media have sharply criticised the draft Bill.\n\nThe Deccan Herald newspaper on June 30 titled an opinion piece A Remedy That’s Worse Than The Menace, saying the Karnataka government should “do away with the criminal provisions” in the legislation.\n\nIndia has over the years held talks with US tech giants such as Google that it sees as having been slow to remove fake news posts, and New Delhi in 2019 set up a Fact Check Unit to debunk what it sees as misinformation.\n\nREUTERS\n\nIndia\n\nSocial Media\n\nTechnology", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/tabla/26e76a42f7a8f3c0282b4bf5b29b26e4c12664f8316d40260da1f4413902e47a?w=825", "alt_text": "The state government of Karnataka has said the Bill will be released for public consultation before implementation."}]}
